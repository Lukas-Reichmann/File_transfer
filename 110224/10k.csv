B usiness. Overview Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative state-of-the-art cloud-native SaaS and on-premise solutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums, and healthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys also is known for its world-class customer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Windward Concourse, Suite 250, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30005. Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2023 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. History and Significant Events Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc. In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries. In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. In fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining operating units. In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market. In fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts. We converted to a Delaware corporation in February 2022. Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest and staff experiences and allow our customers to promote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy, integrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship. 4 Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from subscription services, cloud applications, ongoing support and maintenance agreements, and professional services. Products, Support and Professional Services We are a leading developer and marketer of software-enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software solutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; subscription and maintenance; and professional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core solutions. We present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories: Total revenue for these three specific areas is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Products $ 43,638 $ 35,956 $ 26,714 Subscription and maintenance 118,285 98,958 88,565 Professional services 36,142 27,722 21,897 Total $ 198,065 $ 162,636 $ 137,176 Products: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems. Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions’ ability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases. Subscription and Maintenance: Software subscription and maintenance services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting end-to-end solutions while market demand for innovative new products addressing specific hospitality needs continues to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud. Professional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive experience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money. Our portfolio of hospitality software solutions: The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated “ecosystem cloud” solutions for Hospitality & Leisure, Food & Beverage and Inventory & Procurement functions through the Agilysys Hospitality Experience Cloud. The Company delivers modular and integrated software solutions and expertise to businesses seeking to maximize Return on Experience (ROE) through hospitality encounters that are both personal and profitable. Over time, customers achieve High Return Hospitality by consistently delighting guests, retaining staff and growing margins. The Agilysys Hospitality Experience Cloud offers solution ecosystems that combine core operational systems for property management (PMS), point-of-sale (POS) and Inventory and Procurement (I&P) with Experience Enhancers that meaningfully improve interactions for guests and for employees across 5 dimensions such as digital access, mobile convenience, self-service control, personal choice, payment options, service coverage and real-time insights to improve decisions. Core solutions and Experience Enhancers are selectively combined in Hospitality Solution Studios tailored to specific hospitality settings and business needs. Our integrated yet modular products allow hospitality operators to recruit and delight customers at their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest, retain valuable staff and improve the overall experience throughout the entire guest journey – from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions.

Casino UT Southwestern Medical Center Comanche Nation of Oklahoma MGM Vail Resorts Costa Pacifica Oxford Casino Valley View Casino & Hotel The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas Palm Garden Hotel Wendover Resorts Industry and Markets We are a technology software solutions company exclusively focused on the hospitality industry. Our products have been enabling mission-critical core hospitality operations for more than four decades. Our software solutions are required to run the operations of the hospitality business and designed to drive substantial customer benefits through increased revenue, improved operational efficiency, enhanced guest experience and improved employee morale. In addition, many of our solutions enable social distancing capabilities for our customers. Our innovative software solutions described above have been purpose-built to serve the unique needs of the following hospitality verticals: casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. We operate across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. We estimate our total addressable market to be approximately $5 billion in annual recurring revenue opportunity. While the size of the opportunity might face pressure in an economic downturn, we feel it remains in the billions of dollars while our business represents only a fraction of that size. We are well positioned to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the industry. Customers Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of 12 customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly fragmented. Human Capital As of March 31, 2023, we employed approximately 1,600 employees, with approximately 66%, 30%, 3%, and 1% of our employees located in India, North America, Asia-Pacific, and EMEA, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success. Our senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses in hospitality. We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their growth and development. We offer our employees pay and benefits packages that we believe are competitive with others throughout our industry, as well as within the local markets in which we operate, and align individual performance with our success. We are committed to providing our employees with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We make all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws. All employees, directors, independent contractors, and other parties who work with Agilysys are expected to create a working environment where everyone is respected, regardless of individual differences. We believe that each of our employees' individual character, virtues, and individual experiences will leverage our ability to attract and retain quality employees, customers, and suppliers. Seasonality Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results. Competition Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. We compete with other full-service providers who sell and deliver bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of software, hardware, subscription, maintenance, and professional services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., Shiji, Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies who prodive either POS or PMS solutions like Maestro. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains. Environmental Matters We believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations. Access to Information Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our corporate website, http://www .agilysys.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Risks Relating to Our Business Markets, Competition, and Operations Our business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions. Because we conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including in areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), political unrest, armed conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine war), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any general weakening 13 of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously purchased products and services. Our business is negatively impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in energy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in air travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption of businesses and supply chains worldwide. The resulting travel, work and social restrictions along with actions by governmental authorities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak led to a significant decrease in global economic activity and global trade. While COVID-19 restrictions have since eased globally, a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or a future pandemic, depending on its duration and severity, could materially adversely impact the global economy and our industry, operations and financial condition and performance. Even after COVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities. Similarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which may adversely affect demand for our customers’ restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity. Our business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes. We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the supply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with international supply. For example, in recent years the United States has imposed and extended greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs, including on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply costs, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance. Our business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer’s needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. The development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including: Our product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will, if ever, receive significant revenues from these investments. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services. Several companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our 14 competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future. We compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or services, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity. Our future success depends on our ability to execute on growth or strategic initiatives, properly manage investments in our business and operations, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure. Our success also depends on our ability to execute on other growth or strategic initiatives we are pursuing. A key element of our long-term strategy is to continue to invest in and grow our business and operations, both organically and through acquisitions. Investments in new markets, solutions, and technologies, research and development, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion, and headcount are critical components for achieving this strategy. In particular, we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. Our investments in research and development may result in products or services that generate less revenue than we anticipate. However, such investments and efforts present challenges and risks and may not be successful (financially or otherwise), especially in new areas in which we have little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our profitability in the short-term. To be successful in such efforts, we must be able to properly allocate limited investment funds and other resources, prioritize among opportunities, balance the extent and timing of investments with the associated impact on profitability, balance our focus between new areas and the servicing of our existing customers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas, or with the new solutions, in which we have invested. Our success also depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations. Our existing infrastructure, systems, security, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. System upgrades or new implementations can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive and we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems during or following such implementations, including among others, potential disruptions in our operations or financial reporting. If we are unable to properly execute on growth initiatives, manage our investments, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected. Our dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them. We rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs. We do not have long term agreements with many of these suppliers. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services needs from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner programs, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it may have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins. If we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel, or if labor costs continue to rise, our ability to operate and grow our business may be impaired and our financial results may suffer. We depend on the services of our management and employees to continuously run and grow our business. To grow successfully, we must retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees, including in growth areas we may enter. Retention is an industry challenge given the competitive technology labor market. As we grow, we must also enhance and expand our workforce to execute on new and larger opportunities and challenges. The market for qualified personnel is competitive in the geographies in which we operate and may be limited especially in technology areas. We may be at a disadvantage to larger companies with greater brand recognition or financial resources or to start-ups or other emerging companies in trending market sectors. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel when and where they are needed, our ability to operate and grow our business could be impaired. Moreover, if we are not able to properly balance our investments in personnel with revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected. While the market for talent in our industry has been competitive for many years, in recent quarters, the labor market has become even tighter, increasing the difficulty and lead time in filling open positions with qualified candidates. Ongoing labor shortages or 15 increasing labor costs could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, especially if rising costs outpace our revenue growth. Our international operations have many associated risks. We continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and challenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. We have international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, Dubai, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and India. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support channels in key international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and difficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and managing foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing integrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs, enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; foreign currency fluctuations; inflation and any regulatory actions to counter inflation; and political and economic instability abroad. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research and development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our administrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is concentrated in our India research and development center. While we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, a natural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location that prevents or substantially impairs our employees’ ability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers. Regulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality Cyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data against cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in the design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers. The number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including sophisticated “supply-chain” attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks, anticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained therein, our customers and ultimately, our business. These events, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations. 16 We are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. A failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security such as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or potential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities. Our software may be used in connection with processing personal data and other sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the customer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our development and implementation processes, we cannot assure that our customers’ systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access to our software can be prevented. If a customer, or any other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach of our software, our business could be adversely affected. For certain products and services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant risk exposure for us. We maintain relationships with third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including cloud hosting and other cloud-based services. We make contractual obligations to customers based on these relationships and, in some cases, also entrust these providers with both our own sensitive data as well as the sensitive data of our customers (that may include sensitive guest data). If these third-party providers do not perform as expected or encounter service disruptions, cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other difficulties, we or our customers may be materially and adversely affected, including, among other things, by facing increased costs, potential liability to customers, guests, or other third parties, regulatory issues, and reputational harm. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers because of poor performance, security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time, expense, or exposure to us, any of which could materially adversely impact our business. We also purchase hardware and technology, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our competitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established providers wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be smaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally, or in an effort to benefit our margins. If any of these providers experience financial, operational, or quality assurance difficulties, or if any cease production, or there is any other disruption in the services we or our customers receive, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a competitor, macroeconomic issues like those described above (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), or otherwise, we will be required to locate and migrate to alternative sources or providers, to internally develop the applicable technologies, to redesign our products, or to remove certain features from our products or to reduce our service levels, any of which would likely increase our expenses, create delays, or negatively impact our revenues. Although we strive to establish contractual protections with key providers, such as source code escrows, warranties, and indemnities, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling or unable to stand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the event our relationship with a key provider is interrupted. We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. 17 We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. Although on May 11, 2022, judgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the judgement. If we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal liability. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high quality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions, breaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions or breaches adversely impact our customers’ businesses. In addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses. While our contracts typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for errors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability. Risks Relating to the Industries We Serve Our business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Because our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business and sales are largely dependent on the health of that industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality industry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. Consolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business. Customers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry. Although recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance that future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider’s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services from us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Insolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business. Customers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our customers to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property. Customers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements 18 with us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Our Finances and Capital Structure Our stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. During the year ended March 31, 2023, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a low close of $32.41 to a high close of $87.33. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: On May 22, 2020, we sold $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $20.1676 per share. Dilution upon the conversion of the preferred stock in the future may negatively impact the price of our common stock. Additionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the volatility of our common share price over time. If we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits. As part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects. Our financial results may be significantly impacted by changes in our tax position. We are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be impacted by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (including our net operating loss carryforwards), changes in unrecognized tax benefits, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States, may from time to time review the pricing arrangements between us and our foreign subsidiaries or among our foreign subsidiaries. An adverse determination by one or more tax authorities in this regard may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We have significant deferred tax assets which can provide us with significant future cash tax savings if we are able to use them, including significant net operating losses. However, the extent to which we will be able to use these net operating losses may be impacted, restricted, or eliminated by a number of factors, including changes in tax rates, laws or regulations, and whether we generate sufficient future taxable income. To the extent that we are unable to utilize our net operating losses or other losses, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. When we cease to have net operating losses available to us in a particular tax jurisdiction, either through their expiration, disallowance, or utilization, our cash tax liability will increase in that jurisdiction. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could negatively impact our financial results. 19 We earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets, and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Indian rupee, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar, and Canadian dollar, among others. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of entities using non-U.S. dollar functional currencies into U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period, meaning that we are exposed to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar impact our net income with associated gains or losses recorded within other income (expense), net. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Some of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. We may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results. As of March 31, 2023, we had $32.6 million of goodwill and $18.1 million of intangible assets, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We review our indefinite-lived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event or events indicate the potential for impairment. We assess as needed whether there have been impairments in our other intangible assets. We make assumptions and estimates in our assessments that can be complex and subjective. In our assumptions and estimates we consider whether negative factors exist such as deteriorating economic conditions, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, intensified competition, market capitalization declines, or significant changes in use of the intangible assets. To the extent that such factors or other negative factors emerge, we may record non-cash impairment charges in the future that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We may encounter risks associated with maintaining large cash balances. While we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts, if any. Other Risk Factors We are subject to litigation, which may be costly. As a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such litigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact on our business. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

In addition, we lease approximately 36,000 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, 30,000 square feet of office space in Bellevue, Washington, of which we sublease 22,000 square feet to a third party, 5,000 square feet of office space in Santa Barbara, 20 California, and 6,000 square feet of warehouse space in Roswell, Georgia. Internationally, we lease approximately 101,000 square feet of office space in Chennai, India, 7,000 square feet in Toronto, Canada, and lease several other smaller office locations throughout Europe and Asia. Our major leases contain renewal options for periods of up to 10 years. We believe our office space facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs and do not anticipate any difficulty securing additional space as needed. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of any current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In December 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth appealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Although on May 11, 2022, judgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the judgement. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of Ameranth’s pending appeal on their claims against us, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. Item 4. Mine Safe ty Disclosures. Not applicable. 21 Part II Item 5.

Item 6. [Reserved] 23 Item 7. Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report titled, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 3 of this Annual Report and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments Macroeconomic Conditions During the year ended March 31, 2023, global macroeconomic conditions were, and continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and the erosion of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We believe such conditions are impacting customer spending and provider pricing decisions resulting in decreased demand, increased costs, and reduced margins particularly in areas outside of the United States. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative state-of-the-art cloud-native SaaS and on-premise guest-centric technology solutions. Customers around the world include: branded and independent hotels; multi-amenity resort properties; casinos; property, hotel and resort management companies; cruise lines; corporate dining providers; higher education campus dining providers; food service management companies; hospitals; lifestyle communities; senior living facilities; stadiums; and theme parks. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive software solutions in the industry, including point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the entire guest journey. Agilysys is also known for its world class customer-centric service. Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia. Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to existing software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: 24 The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, increasing profitability and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue – Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, subscription and maintenance revenue or professional services revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: 25 Results of Operations Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022: Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 43,638 $ 35,956 $ 7,682 21.4 % Subscription and maintenance 118,285 98,958 19,327 19.5 % Professional services 36,142 27,722 8,420 30.4 % Total net revenue 198,065 162,636 35,429 21.8 % Cost of goods sold: Products 22,994 19,251 3,743 19.4 % Subscription and maintenance 26,262 21,141 5,121 24.2 % Professional services 27,990 20,712 7,278 35.1 % Total cost of goods sold 77,246 61,104 16,142 26.4 % Gross profit $ 120,819 $ 101,532 $ 19,287 19.0 % Gross profit margin 61.0 % 62.4 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 50,260 $ 46,332 $ 3,928 8.5 % Sales and marketing 22,716 14,730 7,986 54.2 % General and administrative 30,669 27,734 2,935 10.6 % Depreciation of fixed assets 1,769 2,210 (441 ) (20.0 )% Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,743 1,654 89 5.4 % Other charges 435 1,584 (1,149 ) (72.5 )% Legal settlements 352 969 (617 ) nm Operating income $ 12,875 $ 6,319 $ 6,556 nm Operating income percentage 6.5 % 3.9 % nm - not meaningful 26 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2023 2022 Net revenue: Products 22.1 % 22.1 % Subscription and maintenance 59.7 60.8 Professional services 18.2 17.1 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.6 % 11.8 % Subscription and maintenance 13.3 13.0 Professional services 14.1 12.8 Total cost of goods sold 39.0 % 37.6 % Gross profit 61.0 % 62.4 % Operating expenses: Product development 25.3 % 28.4 % Sales and marketing 11.5 9.1 General and administrative 15.5 17.1 Depreciation of fixed assets 0.9 1.4 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.9 1.0 Other charges 0.2 1.0 Legal settlements 0.2 0.5 Operating income 6.5 % 3.9 % Net revenue. Total revenue increased $35.4 million, or 21.8%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Products revenue increased $7.7 million, or 21.4%, due to higher sales and deliveries to new customers and expansion with existing customers. Subscription and maintenance revenue increased $19.3 million, or 19.5%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased 27.5% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Professional services revenue increased $8.4 million, or 30.4%, due to higher sales and service activity as our new and existing customers continue implementing technology to improve their operations. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $19.3 million, or 19.0%, in fiscal 2023 and total gross profit margin decreased from 62.4% to 61.0%. Products gross profit increased $3.9 million and gross profit margin increased from 46.5% to 47.3% due to a higher proportion of proprietary software revenue over third-party products. Subscription and maintenance gross profit increased $14.2 million and gross profit margin decreased from 78.6% to 77.8% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit increased $1.1 million and gross profit margin decreased from 25.3% to 22.6% reflecting lower utilization rates due to higher non-billable hours on new, more complex solution implementations over the comparable annual periods. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements and other charges, increased $14.5 million, or 15.6%, in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have decreased 2.9% in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $3.9 million, or 8.5%, during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to hiring and higher salary and incentive rates across our development teams, increased travel, and higher subscription charges for cloud computing arrangements. 27 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $8.0 million, or 54.2%, in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 due to various sales and marketing investments including several key hires, significantly higher levels of marketing event and trade show activity and increased commission expense on higher sales levels. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $2.9 million, or 10.6%, in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to investments in our information security and information technology infrastructure along with hiring and increased salary and incentive rates across our administrative teams, higher rent, increased travel, and higher subscription charges for cloud computing arrangements. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.4 million or 20.0% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles increased $0.1 million or 5.4% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to the addition of certain intangible assets that began amortizing in January 2022 subsequent to the acquisition of ResortSuite Inc. (ResortSuite) as described in Note 15, Business Combination , to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report. Other charges. Other charges decreased $1.1 million due to a significant reduction in non-recurring charges including ResortSuite acquisition costs during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Legal settlements. Legal settlements decreased $0.6 million during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to an decrease in settlements of employment and other business-related matters. Other Income (Expenses) Year ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Other income (expense): Interest income $ 2,192 $ 59 $ (2,133 ) nm Interest (expense) — (12 ) (12 ) nm Other income, net 697 145 (552 ) nm Total other income, net $ 2,889 $ 192 $ (2,697 ) nm nm – not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest (expense). Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other income, net. Other income, net mainly consists of movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Income Taxes Year ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Income tax expense $ 1,182 $ 33 $ (1,149 ) nm Effective tax rate 7.5 % 0.5 % nm – not meaningful For fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets including decreases in valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets. We are consistently subject to tax audits. Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements remain uncertain, we expect that, as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations, a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits including related penalties and interest is more likely than not to occur during the next 12 months. 28 Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of the Company's deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during the future periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. As of March 31, 2023, we had $132.0 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2033 to 2039, and $43.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $133.9 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2024 through 2042. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant portion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits. Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021: Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 35,956 $ 26,714 $ 9,242 34.6 % Subscription and maintenance 98,958 88,565 10,393 11.7 % Professional services 27,722 21,897 5,825 26.6 % Total net revenue 162,636 137,176 25,460 18.6 % Cost of goods sold: Products, inclusive of developed technology amortization 19,251 13,506 5,745 42.5 % Subscription and maintenance 21,141 17,985 3,156 17.5 % Professional services 20,712 16,309 4,403 27.0 % Total cost of goods sold 61,104 47,800 13,304 27.8 % Gross profit $ 101,532 $ 89,376 $ 12,156 13.6 % Gross profit margin 62.4 % 65.2 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 46,332 $ 55,345 $ (9,013 ) (16.3 )% Sales and marketing 14,730 14,196 534 3.8 % General and administrative 27,734 33,273 (5,539 ) (16.6 )% Depreciation of fixed assets 2,210 2,832 (622 ) (22.0 )% Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,654 1,959 (305 ) (15.6 )% Other charges 1,584 2,529 (945 ) (37.4 )% Legal settlements 969 200 769 384.5 % Operating income (loss) $ 6,319 $ (20,958 ) $ 27,277 (130.2 )% Operating income (loss) percentage 3.9 % (15.3 )% 29 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2022 2021 Net revenue: Products 22.1 % 19.5 % Subscription and maintenance 60.8 64.6 Professional services 17.1 15.9 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products, inclusive of developed technology amortization 11.8 % 9.8 % Subscription and maintenance 13.0 13.1 Professional services 12.8 11.9 Total cost of goods sold 37.6 % 34.8 % Gross profit 62.4 % 65.2 % Operating expenses: Product development 28.4 % 40.4 % Sales and marketing 9.1 10.3 General and administrative 17.1 24.4 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.4 2.1 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1.0 1.4 Other charges 1.0 1.8 Legal settlements 0.5 0.1 Operating income (loss) 3.9 % (15.3 )% Net revenue. Total revenue increased $25.5 million, or 18.6%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Products revenue increased $9.2 million, or 34.6%, due to higher sales and deliveries as our customers re-open their locations for business. Subscription and maintenance revenue increased $10.4 million, or 11.7%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased 28.0% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Professional services revenue increased $5.8 million, or 26.6%, due to higher sales and service activity as our customers shift their focus to implementing technology to improve their operations. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $12.2 million, or 13.6%, in fiscal 2022 and total gross profit margin decreased from 65.2% to 62.4%. Products gross profit increased $3.5 million and gross profit margin decreased from 49.4% to 46.5% due to a higher proportion of third-party products over proprietary software revenue. Subscription and maintenance gross profit increased $7.2 million and gross profit margin decreased from 79.7% to 78.6% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit increased $1.4 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 25.5% to 25.3% due to continued hiring and training of new staff to meet increasing project backlogs from ongoing sales activity and certain project delays. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements and other charges, decreased $14.9 million, or 13.9%, in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have decreased 21.5% in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development decreased $9.0 million, or 16.3%, during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase of $4.4 million in payroll and other operating expenses as we continue to manage market compensation pressures offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $13.4 million due to significant charges resulting from accelerated vesting of stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs) upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. 30 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $0.5 million, or 3.8%, in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 due to an increase of $3.4 million in payroll, travel, advertising, promotion and other operating expenses as we invest in our sales and marketing teams and return to travel for in-person selling and increased marketing event and trade show activity offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $2.9 million due to significant charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. General and administrative. General and administrative decreased $5.5 million, or 16.6%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase of $3.7 million in payroll and other expenses after restoring base pay, employee benefits and various operational activities offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $9.2 million due to significant charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.6 million or 22.0% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles decreased $0.3 million or 15.6% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to a lower unamortized cost base following the impairment of intangibles in fiscal 2020. Other charges. Other charges decreased $0.9 million due to a significant reduction in employee terminations during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Legal settlements. Legal settlements increased $0.8 million during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase in settlements of employment and other business-related matters.

We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all the Company’s deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during the future periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. At March 31, 2022, we had $196.3 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $42.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $166.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2023 through 2041. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, and payments of contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. We disclose our lease obligations in Note 6, Leases , and preferred stock dividends in Note 14, Preferred Stock , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report. At March 31, 2023, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 93% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $112.8 million as of March 31, 2023, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements.

Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 were $6.9 million due to $7.3 million in purchases of property and equipment, including internal use software and $0.4 million in cash received from final working capital adjustments related to the ResortSuite acquisition. 32 Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 were $25.7 million due to $24.5 million in cash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired, and $1.2 million in purchases of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 were $1.4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flow (used in) provided by financing activities. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 were $11.1 million due to share repurchases of $9.3 million to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.8 million in preferred stock dividends. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 were $4.9 million and primarily comprised of share repurchases of $3.0 million to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.8 million in preferred stock dividends. During fiscal 2021, the $25.3 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $7.5 million for the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.1 million in preferred stock dividends. Investments Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies Managements’ Discussion and Analysis is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different 33 goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. We recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating the price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and bearing the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of sale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. We derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for our proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes the same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the contract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of payment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. 34 Share-based compensation. We have an equity incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares. We record compensation expense related to stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and restricted stock unit grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and stock-settled appreciation right grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share, restricted stock unit and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold, performance period term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 13, Share-Based Compensation , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report. Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information about accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. We have assets, liabilities, and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk. We sell products and services internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements. For the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue from international operations was 7%, 7% and 8%, respectively of total revenue. The effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the 2023, 2022 and 2021 fiscal years. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies could materially impact our revenue, expenses, operating profit and net income. 35 Item 8. Financial Statemen ts and Supplementary Data.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated May 19, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Atlanta, Georgia May 19, 2023 37 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders Agilysys, Inc. Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Agilysys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023, and our report dated May 19, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Atlanta, Georgia May 19, 2023 38 AGILYSYS, INC.

For example, fiscal 2023 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 . 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Agilysys, Inc. and subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity or cost method, as appropriate. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated. Use of estimates. Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity from date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Other highly liquid investments considered cash equivalents with no established maturity date are fully redeemable on demand (without penalty) with settlement of principal and accrued interest on the same or following business day after instruction to redeem. Cash equivalent investments are readily convertible to cash with no penalty and can include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, money market funds and other investments. Commercial paper cash equivalents totaled $ 5.0 million and $ 15.0 million as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs (level 2) based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. Allowance for expected credit losses. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We base our expected credit loss model on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. To help mitigate the associated credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. Customer credit allowance . We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount of customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many cases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we invoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested by the customer within the terms of our contract. Inventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of related reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, if necessary, are based upon contractual provisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors, including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. 44 Leases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are presented as Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities – current and operating lease liabilities – non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and corresponding liabilities are included in finance lease obligations – current and non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying asset, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments in exchange for the ability to use the asset for the duration of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and determined using the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing since our leases do not include an implicit interest rate. The estimated incremental borrowing rate considers market data, actual lease economic environment, and actual lease term at commencement date. The lease term may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. ROU assets include lease payments made in advance, and excludes any incentives received or initial direct costs incurred. We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which we account for as a single lease component. We also have leases which include variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred. Our variable lease payments are not based on an index or rate and therefore are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. We have elected to not recognize short term leases that have a term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities. Our short-term leases are not material and do not have a material impact on our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Additionally, we do not have any covenants, residual value guarantees, or related party transactions associated with our lease agreements. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of goodwill was $ 32.6 million and $ 32.8 million, respectively. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist, based on our one reporting unit. The Company evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing its market capitalization based on its closing stock price (Level 1 input) to the book value of its equity on the annual evaluation date. The Company is also required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least annually, or when current events and circumstances require an interim assessment. The Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets has occurred for the years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 . Acquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include identifiable customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names. We amortize the cost of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which are periods of 15 years or less, primarily on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are determined primarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows attributable to these assets to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. Long-lived assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance, repairs, and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under finance leases, which make up less than one percent of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements – 7 to 30 years ; furniture – 7 to 10 years ; equipment – 3 to 10 years ; software – 3 to 10 years ; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the economic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project’s completion. Depreciation for capitalized project expenditures does not begin until the underlying project is completed. We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Our long-lived assets and impairments considerations are discussed further in Note 4, Property and Equipment, Net. Foreign currency translation. The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currencies are not in U.S. dollars are translated at the period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates during the fiscal year. The cumulative translation effects are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional 45 currency of an operation are reflected within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency gains and losses from changes in exchange rates have not been material to our consolidated operating results. Revenue recognition. We derive revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. For the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue from international operations was 7 % , 7 % and 8 %, respectively of total revenue. Our customer base is highly fragmented. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. We recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of sale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. We derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for our proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes the same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the contract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of payment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. 46 We use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Comprehensive income (loss). Comprehensive income (loss) is the total of net income (loss), as currently reported under GAAP, plus other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) considers the effects of additional transactions and economic events that are not required to be recorded in determining net income (loss), but rather are reported as a separate statement of comprehensive income (loss). Fair value measurements. We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. In determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use various valuation techniques. Investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies. Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with certain former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their respective designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $ 1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated beneficiary of $ 0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities.” Additional information regarding the investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is provided in Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans . Income Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 9, Income Taxes . Advertising and Promotion Expense. We expense advertising and promotion expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense was $ 4.8 million , $ 2.6 million and $ 0.4 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 , respectively . Accounting Pronouncements Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 47 3. Revenue Recognition For in depth discussion regarding our revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 43.6 million , $ 36.0 million, and $ 26.7 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. Revenue recognized over time (subscription and maintenance, and professional services) totaled $ 154.4 million , $ 126.7 million, and $ 110.5 million during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to products and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 45.3 million and $ 38.1 million during fiscal 2023 and 2022. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we transferred from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 1.7 million and $ 2.4 million , respectively, to accounts receivable because the right to the transaction became unconditional. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of March 31, 2023 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. For first year support and maintenance service contracts, commission expenses are immaterial and therefore expenses as incurred. Other sales commission expenses are not material or have a period of benefit of one year or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.9 million and $ 3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we expensed $ 3.6 million and $ 2.5 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 1.3 million and $ 1.2 million , respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 4. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment at March 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Furniture and equipment $ 12,097 $ 14,632 Software 15,989 16,338 Leasehold improvements 5,656 7,123 Facilities construction in progress 9,721 17 43,463 38,110 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 28,887 ) ( 31,765 ) Property and equipment, net $ 14,576 $ 6,345 48 Total depreciation expense on property and equipment was $ 1.8 million , $ 2.2 million, and $ 2.8 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company capitalizes internal-use software, including software purchased and used exclusively in providing services or that is only made available to customers as a software service, as property and equipment under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software . Total amortization expense on capitalized internal-use software was $ 0.6 million , $ 1.3 million and $ 2.0 million during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Assets under financing leases are included in property and equipment categories above and further disclosed with Note 6. Leases . 5. Intangible Assets, Goodwill, and Software Development Costs The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs at March 31, 2023, and 2022: March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Gross Net Gross Net carrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying carrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying (In thousands) amount amortization Impairment amount amount amortization impairment amount Finite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 19,809 $ ( 11,529 ) $ — $ 8,280 $ 20,391 $ ( 10,938 ) $ — $ 9,453 Non-competition agreements 3,487 ( 3,192 ) — 295 3,547 ( 2,808 ) — 739 Developed technology 11,166 ( 10,590 ) — 576 11,224 ( 10,440 ) — 784 Trade names 1,015 ( 426 ) — 589 1,075 ( 273 ) — 802 Patented technology 80 ( 80 ) — — 80 ( 80 ) — — 35,557 ( 25,817 ) — 9,740 36,317 ( 24,539 ) — 11,778 Indefinite-lived trade names 8,400 N/A — 8,400 8,400 N/A — 8,400 Total intangible assets $ 43,957 $ ( 25,817 ) $ — $ 18,140 $ 44,717 $ ( 24,539 ) $ — $ 20,178 (In thousands) Software development costs $ 67,541 $ ( 45,535 ) $ ( 22,006 ) $ — $ 67,541 $ ( 45,535 ) $ ( 22,006 ) $ — During the year ended March 31, 2023, goodwill increased $ 0.8 million due to business combination activity and decreased $ 0.9 million due to foreign currency translation. During the year ended March 31, 2022, goodwill increased $ 13.1 million due to business combination activity. During the year ended March 31, 2023 , finite-lived intangible assets decreased $ 1.3 million due to amortization expense and decreased $ 0.8 million due to foreign currency translation. During the year ended March 31, 2022, finite-lived intangible assets increased $ 12.2 million due to business combination activity and $ 0.4 million due to amortization expense. See Note 15, Business Combination , for more information on business combination activity. Estimated future amortization expense on finite-lived intangible assets is as follows: (In thousands) Estimated Amortization Expense Fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 $ 1,208 2025 913 2026 913 2027 835 2028 602 Thereafter 5,269 Total $ 9,740 Indefinite-lived intangible assets, comprised of our purchased trade name InfoGenesis as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 are tested for impairment upon identification of impairment indicators or at least annually. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than fair value. The InfoGenesis indefinite-lived purchased trade name impairment testing resulted in a fair value exceeding the carrying amount for the years ending March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 . 49 6. Leases The majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of office equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by or associated with our active leases. During April 2023, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately $ 1.4 million that will commence in fiscal year 2024 with a lease term of approximately 3.5 years. We do not have any related party leases. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable costs are expensed as incurred. We sublease one of our office leases located in Bellevue, Washington with a lease term that will expire during fiscal year 2024. The components of lease expenses, which are included in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, were as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Operating leases expense $ 5,301 $ 4,752 Finance lease expense: Amortization of ROU assets 3 17 Interest on lease liabilities 1 2 Total finance lease expense 4 19 Variable lease costs 700 463 Short term lease expense 300 140 Sublease income ( 789 ) ( 782 ) Total lease expense $ 5,516 $ 4,592 Other information related to leases for fiscal 2023 and 2022 was as follows: Year ended March 31, Supplemental cash flow information 2023 2022 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in thousands): Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 5,862 $ 5,536 Operating cash flows for finance leases 6 23 Financing cash flows for finance leases 4 19 ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands): Operating leases $ 8,292 $ 1,314 Weighted average remaining lease terms Operating leases 7.59 3.08 Finance leases 0.58 1.43 Weighted average discount rates Operating leases 6.44 % 7.62 % Finance leases 4.50 % 4.50 % 50 The table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-cancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2023: (In thousands) Operating leases (1) Finance leases Fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 $ 3,408 $ 2 2025 2,905 2026 2,726 2027 2,219 2028 1,431 Thereafter 8,816 Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments 21,505 2 Less: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease liabilities ( 4,765 ) — Total lease liabilities $ 16,740 $ 2 7.

Income Taxes For the year ended March 31, income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following: (In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Income (loss) before income taxes United States $ 14,526 $ 1,598 $ ( 26,272 ) Foreign 1,238 4,913 5,063 Total income (loss) before income taxes $ 15,764 $ 6,511 $ ( 21,209 ) For the year ended March 31, income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following: (In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Income tax expense (benefit) Current: Federal $ 87 $ 62 $ 9 State and local 277 21 30 Foreign 1,070 853 731 Deferred: Federal 12 12 12 State and local 77 7 32 Foreign ( 341 ) ( 922 ) ( 1,022 ) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 1,182 $ 33 $ ( 208 ) The following table presents the principal components of the difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for the years ended March 31: (In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Income tax expense (benefit) at the US Federal statutory rate $ 3,340 $ 1,368 $ ( 4,454 ) Expense (benefit) for state taxes 377 ( 65 ) ( 803 ) Impact of foreign operations ( 78 ) ( 819 ) ( 841 ) Indefinite life assets 20 19 43 Intercompany gain 177 — — Change in valuation allowance ( 2,276 ) ( 2,623 ) 7,271 Change in liability for unrecognized tax benefits 24 25 26 Share-based compensation ( 241 ) ( 2,018 ) ( 2,232 ) Global intangible low-taxed income 101 971 985 Deferred adjustments ( 281 ) ( 260 ) ( 478 ) Provision to return ( 31 ) 3,438 278 Other 50 ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 1,182 $ 33 $ ( 208 ) We have elected to account for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusions in the period in which they are incurred. The fiscal 2023 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax expense and minimal expense from the U.S. The fiscal 2023 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets; offset by current year expense in foreign jurisdictions. 52 The fiscal 2022 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax benefit. The fiscal 2022 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets and the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, are as follows: (In thousands) 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Accrued liabilities $ 8,748 $ 7,574 Allowance for expected credit losses and doubtful accounts 132 83 Federal losses and credit carryforwards 36,912 50,612 Foreign losses and credit carryforwards 3,555 2,793 State losses and credit carryforwards 10,080 11,179 Deferred revenue 291 193 Capitalized research expenses 11,399 — Property and equipment and software amortization 325 416 Operating lease liabilities 4,171 1,489 Goodwill and other intangible assets ( 536 ) 607 Other 185 163 75,262 75,109 Less: valuation allowance ( 67,928 ) ( 69,515 ) Total 7,334 5,594 Deferred tax liabilities: Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 3,153 ) ( 1,269 ) Goodwill and other intangible assets ( 3,659 ) ( 2,575 ) Other 12 ( 15 ) Total ( 6,800 ) ( 3,859 ) Total deferred tax assets, net $ 534 $ 1,735 At March 31, 2023, we had $ 132.0 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2033 to 2039, and $ 43.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. Our Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore and Australia subsidiaries have $ 0.6 million , $ 0.6 million , $ 0.5 million and $ 0.1 million of net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia can be carried forward indefinitely. Canada losses can be carried back three years and carried forward 20 years. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5 years of operations which includes fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is then subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during the second five years of operations which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. The aggregate value of the benefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $ 2.7 million as of March 31, 2023. The Company has paid minimum alternative taxes during the period of regular tax relief resulting in a credit of $ 1.8 million as of March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2023 we also had $ 133.9 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2024 through 2042. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made a significant change to Internal Revenue Code Section 174, which went into effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021. The change requires Companies to capitalize specific research and experimental (“R&E”) expenditures and amortize over five years for U.S. incurred R&E or fifteen years for foreign incurred R&E beginning on January 1, 2022. The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our deferred tax assets but does not impact our cash tax liabilities in the current period. We have recorded valuation allowances offsetting substantially all the Company’s deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2023, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $ 67.9 million was comprised of $ 66.2 million for federal and state deferred tax assets, and $ 1.7 million associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore, the Philippines and Australia. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during the future periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected earnings, and tax planning strategies in our assessment of positive and negative evidence supporting the likelihood of deferred tax asset realization. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have 53 sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant portion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance releases will depend on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded effective tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not impact the amount of cash paid for income taxes. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $ 22.2 million and $ 17.1 million as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we will invest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign acquisitions and expansion. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable. As of March 31, 2023, we had a liability of $ 0.6 million related to uncertain tax positions, the recognition of which would impact our effective income tax rate. There have been no changes to our uncertain tax positions during the three years ended March 31, 2023. We recognize interest accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $ 0.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, we had approximately $ 0.6 million and $ 0.6 million, respectively, of interest and penalties accrued in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are consistently subject to tax audits. Due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements remain uncertain, we expect that, as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations, a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits is more likely than not to occur during the next 12 months. In the U.S. we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five years. Although we have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open from 2011 forward due to attribute carryforwards. The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2018 forward in certain state jurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years. Years beginning after 2016 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities. 10. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans We maintain 401(k) plans for employees located in the United States meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, and we match 100 % of the first 1% of the employee's pre-tax contributions and 50 % of the next 5% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. We may also make discretionary contributions each year for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. Agilysys matching contributions were $ 1.7 million , $ 1.4 million , and $ 0.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We also maintain defined contribution retirement plans for employees located in the United Kingdom and in the Asia Pacific region in accordance with local statutory requirements and business practices. Defined Benefit Plan We maintain a defined benefit retirement plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees of our India subsidiary in accordance with local statutory requirements and business practices. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The Gratuity Plan is unfunded with obligation amounts recorded in the Consolidated 54 Balance Sheets as “Employee benefit obligations” within “Other non-current liabilities” and ""Salaries, wages, and related benefits"" within ""Accrued liabilities"". Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agilysys provides certain former executives with life insurance benefits through endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the cash surrender value of $ 1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiaries of $ 0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities."" Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies related to gains and losses incurred on these investments are classified within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a loss of $ 18,000 in fiscal 2023 and a gain of $ 13,000 and $ 31,000 in 2022 and 2021 , respectively, related to the corporate-owned life insurance policies. 11. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Contingencies We are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of any current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In December 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth appealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 11, 2022, in accordance with its prior rulings, the District Court entered judgment in favor of us and against Ameranth on all claims asserted against us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of Ameranth’s pending appeal on their claims against us, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 55 12. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Year Ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 14,582 $ 6,478 $ ( 21,001 ) Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs — — ( 1,031 ) Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 1,836 ) ( 1,836 ) ( 1,576 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 12,746 $ 4,642 $ ( 23,608 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,694 24,357 23,458 Dilutive SSARs 1,059 1,063 — Dilutive RSUs — — — Dilutive unvested restricted shares 176 63 — Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,929 25,483 23,458 Income (loss) per share - basic: $ 0.52 $ 0.19 $ ( 1.01 ) Income (loss) per share - diluted: $ 0.49 $ 0.18 $ ( 1.01 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares and preferred shares 1,741 1,736 4,228 Basic income (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 407,324 , 147,973 and 132,198 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs), restricted stock units, and unvested restricted shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 13. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted stock units that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or grants of restricted shares, restricted stock units or performance shares. For SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition. Restricted shares and restricted stock units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and 56 contingencies. Restricted shares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying grants. We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock unit and restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. We used the simplified method for SSAR grants during the year ended March 31, 2021 because we believed historical exercise data did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. For restricted stock unit, restricted share, and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold, performance period term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted stock units, restricted shares, and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021: Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Product development 7,987 8,186 21,634 Sales and marketing 1,044 1,355 4,254 General and administrative 3,927 5,008 14,206 Total share-based compensation expense 12,958 14,549 40,093 Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. We use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of service condition SSARs. There were no service condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2023 or 2022. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing service condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2021: 2021 Risk-free interest rate 0.31 % Expected life (in years) 4 Expected volatility 42.99 % Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 22.57 The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected life of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded vesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date. We use a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of market condition SSARs. There were no market condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2023 or 2022. The following table summarizes the principal valuation assumptions utilized and the resulting fair value of market condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2021: 57 2021 Risk-free interest rate over contractual term 0.60 % Expected volatility 40.00 % Suboptimal exercise factor 2.50x Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 19.55 The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2023 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted- Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2022 2,172,939 $ 24.02 Granted — — Exercised ( 573,016 ) 18.70 Forfeited ( 27,463 ) 20.02 Cancelled/expired — — Outstanding at March 31, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 3.2 $ 88,804 Exercisable at March 31, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 3.2 $ 88,804 Vested and expected to vest at March 31, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 3.2 $ 88,804 The following table presents additional information related to SSARs activity during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021: (In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Compensation expense $ 3,188 $ 10,030 $ 35,808 Total intrinsic value of SSARs exercised $ 28,025 $ 34,437 $ 25,153 Total fair value of SSARs vesting $ 13,037 $ 6,439 $ 31,380 As of March 31, 2023 , there was no unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to SSARs. A total of 403,079 shares, net of 127,747 shares withheld to cover the employee’s minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury shares to settle SSARs exercised during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023. The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares. Restricted Shares We use a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of restricted shares subject to a market condition. There were no restricted shares subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2023 or 2021. The following table summarizes the principal valuation assumptions utilized and the resulting fair value of restricted shares subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2022: 2022 Risk-free interest rate over contractual term 0.5 % - 0.9 % Expected volatility 54.0 % - 56.0 % Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 24.77 - $ 39.12 58 We granted restricted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted shares are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2022 147,973 $ 43.56 Granted 342,761 48.77 Vested ( 71,751 ) 45.73 Forfeited ( 11,659 ) 45.35 Outstanding at March 31, 2023 407,324 $ 47.53 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares includes grants subject only to a service condition and certain grants subject to both a service condition and a market condition. As of March 31, 2023, a total of 407,324 shares were issued from treasury. The following table presents additional information related to restricted share activity during fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021: (In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Compensation expense $ 9,274 $ 4,339 $ 4,105 Total fair value of restricted share vesting $ 2,952 $ 3,297 $ 7,554 As of March 31, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted shares was $ 11.2 million , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.3 years. We do not include restricted shares in the calculation of earnings per share until the shares are vested. Restricted Stock Units We granted restricted stock units to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted stock units are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 for restricted stock units awarded under the 2020 Plan: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2022 — $ — Granted 67,856 71.62 Vested — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at March 31, 2023 67,856 $ 71.62 We use a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of restricted stock units subject to a market condition. There were no restricted stock units subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2022 or 2021. The following table summarizes the principal valuation assumptions utilized and the resulting fair value of restricted stock units subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2023: 2023 Risk-free interest rate over contractual term 4.3 % Expected volatility 54.0 % Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 60.02 - $ 65.89 59 The following table presents additional information related to restricted stock unit activity during fiscal 2023: (In thousands) 2023 Compensation expense $ 136 Total fair value of restricted stock unit vesting $ — As of March 31, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units was $ 4.7 million , which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 2.4 years. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we grant common shares to our Chief Executive Officer that vest immediately. Once attainment of the performance conditions becomes probable, we recognize compensation expense related to performance shares ratably over the performance period. The number of performance shares granted will be based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date and settlement date, which are the same under the 2020 plan. Based on the performance conditions achieved as they relate to our annual bonus plan, management estimates a liability of $ 0.4 million as of March 31, 2023, to be settled through the granting and vesting of performance shares after March 31, 2023. We recognized compensation expense related to performance shares of $ 0.4 million in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 and $ 0.2 million in each of the fiscal years ending March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 14. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Accounting Policy We classify convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption clauses that are at the election of the Holders. We increase the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value (described below) for all undeclared dividends using the interest method. The Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights, preferences and restrictions (the Certificate of Designation included as Exhibit 3.3 to our Current Report on Form 8-K on February 9, 2022, which superseded the Certificate of Amendment included as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 26, 2020, when we converted to a Delaware corporation in February 2022, defines all terms not otherwise defined below): Voting The Holders are entitled to one vote for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock upon all matters presented to the common shareholders of the Company , and except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or required by law, the Holders and common shareholders will vote together as one class on all matters. Additionally, certain matters specific to the Convertible Preferred Stock will require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. Liquidation Preference Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the 60 “Liquidation Preference”) and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Redemption On and after the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock was initially issued, the Company will have the right, and the Holders will have the right to require the Company, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the then-outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference. Conversion Each Holder has the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as described in the Certificate of Designation). Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023 , the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is at least 150 % of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert. Dividends The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. The Holders are not entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis; however, certain anti-dilution adjustments to the Convertible Preferred Stock may be made in the event of such dividends. The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Change in Control Events Upon certain change of control events involving the Company, the Company has the right, and each Holder has the right, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its then-outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for cash consideration equal to (i) 150% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring prior to the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, (ii) 125% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the third anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and (iii) 100% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued. Standstill Restrictions The Purchaser and its affiliates are subject to certain customary standstill provisions that restrict them from, among other actions, acquiring additional securities of the Company if such acquisition would result in the Purchaser beneficially owning in excess of 25 % of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company until the later of the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and the date on which the Purchaser no longer has record or beneficial ownership of common stock and Convertible Preferred Stock that constitute at least 10 % of the outstanding common stock. 61 15. Business Combination On January 5, 2022 (the acquisition date), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a Canada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of ResortSuite’s operations since the acquisition date. The acquisition extends our solutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The purchase price consisted of $ 22.6 million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand, partially offset by $ 0.3 million of ResortSuite’s cash received in the acquisition, $ 2.2 million of cash paid in March 2022 for certain ResortSuite tax liabilities, and $ 0.4 million in cash received in January 2023 upon release of escrow funds resulting in net cash consideration of $ 24.1 million. We allocated the purchase price for ResortSuite to the intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. We determined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach, which discounts the expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, we applied Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 to record certain customer accounts receivable and the contract liabilities assumed in the acquisition, which consisted of undelivered performance obligations under customer contracts. We adopted ASU 2021-08 early as permitted. As a result, in allocating the purchase price, we recorded $ 2.8 million of contract liabilities, representing the revenue that will be recognized as the underlying performance obligations are delivered. The following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of ResortSuite: (In thousands) Total Components of Purchase Price: Cash $ 24,405 Total purchase price $ 24,405 Allocation of Purchase Price: Net tangible assets (liabilities): Accounts receivable, net $ 2,025 Other current assets, including cash acquired 519 Other assets 567 Current and other liabilities ( 768 ) Contract liabilities ( 2,835 ) Deferred income taxes, non-current ( 1,204 ) Net tangible assets (liabilities) ( 1,696 ) Identifiable intangible assets: Customer relationships 9,634 Non-competition agreements 848 Developed technology 827 Trade names 846 Total identifiable intangible assets 12,155 Goodwill 13,946 Total purchase price allocation $ 24,405 We assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names estimated useful lives of 15 years , two years , five years , and five years , respectively, the weighted average of which is approximately 12.7 years. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives. The goodwill recognized in the ResortSuite purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve a broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce. During the year ended March 31, 2023 , we increased goodwill by $ 0.8 million to record deferred income tax liabilities identified during the measurement period related to Canada tax treatment of certain intangible assets and to record final working capital adjustments related to the purchase price. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 13.9 million of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The Company recognized acquisition costs of $ 0.2 million and $ 0.5 million related to the acquisition of ResortSuite, consisting primarily of professional fees, during the year ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The consolidated statement of operations includes these costs in other charges. 62 Revenue attributable to ResortSuite included in our consolidated statement of operations was $ 5.2 million and $ 1.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The pro forma impact of the business combination during the two years ended March 31, 2022 was not material to our historical consolidated operating results and is therefore not presented. Effective April 1, 2022, ResortSuite became Agilysys Canada, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc. 16. Subsequent Events None. 17. Related Party Transaction See Note 14.

Change in and Disagreements With Accou ntants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures. None. Item 9A. Control s and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, as Principal Accounting Officer (“PAO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO, and PAO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO, CFO, and PAO, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Agilysys, under the supervision of the CEO, CFO, and PAO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision of our CEO, CFO, and PAO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on the evaluation, management concluded that Agilysys maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023. Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued their report regarding Agilysys' internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023, which is included elsewhere in this annual report. Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO, CFO, and PAO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Item 9B. Oth er Information None. Item 9C.

B usiness. Overview Agilysys has been driving hospitality software innovations for more than 40 years, delivering cloud-native SaaS and on-premise ready guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise lines, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive software solutions in the hospitality industry, including point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the entire guest journey. Agilysys is also known for its world class customer-centric service and recent investments in research and development, having modernized virtually all its longstanding trusted software solutions. Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Windward Concourse, Suite 250, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30005. Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2022 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. History and Significant Events Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc. In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries. In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. In fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining operating units. In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market. In fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts. We converted to a Delaware corporation in February 2022. Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy, integrate 4 with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship. Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from subscription services, cloud applications, ongoing support and maintenance agreements, and professional services. Products, Support and Professional Services We are a leading developer and marketer of software-enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software solutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; support, maintenance and subscription services; and professional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core solutions. We present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories: Total revenue for these three specific areas is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Products $ 35,956 $ 26,714 $ 44,230 Support, maintenance and subscription services 98,958 88,565 83,680 Professional services 27,722 21,897 32,847 Total $ 162,636 $ 137,176 $ 160,757 Products: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems. Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions’ ability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases. Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting end-to-end solutions while market demand for innovative new products addressing specific hospitality needs continues to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud. Professional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive experience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money. Our portfolio of hospitality software solutions: The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated “platform-centric” solutions for Lodging and Food & Beverage functions, including the applications necessary to support this ecosystem. 5 Our technology platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests before, during and post-visit. We offer an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve the guest experience, optimize staff efficiency, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our integrated yet modular products allow hospitality operators to recruit and retain customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest and improve the overall experience throughout the entire guest journey – from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions. With our omni-channel suite of software products, we are uniquely positioned to offer solutions that allow customers to adhere to social distancing guidelines, offer contactless solutions at every point of the guest journey, and maximize operational efficiency all while providing an improved guest experience. Point of Sale (POS) Solutions: Agilysys POS solution suite allows customers to provide their guests with an omni-channel experience within their property. Guests are empowered to create their own experiences through ordering from a mobile device or walking up to a self-service kiosk, but also providing for a more traditional experience with staff by interacting with a cashier or bar, or having a server come to them. Irrespective of the channel of interaction for the guest, our POS suite provides a single integrated enterprise-grade back-office management system with robust reporting capabilities. This allows our customers to manage menus, price changes, purchasing trends, inventory management and sales reporting from a single integrated source providing for increased efficiency as well as providing a richer guest profile. Agilysys InfoGenesis® POS is an award-winning point of sale solution that combines a fast, intuitive and highly customizable terminal application with powerful, flexible reporting and configuration capabilities in the back office management portal. The system is easy to set up, and its scalable architecture enables customers to add workstations without having to build out expensive infrastructure.

The system’s detailed and high-quality reporting capabilities provide insight into sales data and guest purchasing trends. Engineered for all regions of the world, the InfoGenesis POS solution suite offers a multinational set of features, including language, currency and local fiscal reporting, coupled with a robust enterprise management capability enabling the largest global customers to efficiently run their businesses. With a foundation platform of modern integration APIs, the solution is also capable of integrating with a variety of ancillary applications allowing our customers to keep their entire technology estate. InfoGenesis POS is available as a cloud-based or on-premise solution. Agilysys IG Flex is a mobility solution that offers full point of sale functionality on a Windows tablet in 6, 8, or 10” form factors. It provides a sleek, modern alternative to traditional point of sale installations and can be used as a slim fixed terminal or as a convertible mobile POS simply by removing the tablet from its base. Agilysys IG KDS is a digital kitchen management solution that integrates with InfoGenesis, IG Buy® Kiosk and IG OnDemand to deliver staff and customer-originated orders to the kitchen for preparation. Custom attributes such as guest phone number, name, guest location or packaging instructions can be provided on each incoming order so the order can be fulfilled promptly to guests. Guests can optionally be notified of order completion via an order status monitor (OSM) or via text message. 6 Agilysys IG Buy is an enterprise-class self-service, customer-facing kiosk point of sale solution for the hospitality industry. It is ideal for food & beverage venues such as buffets, grab ‘n go, corporate cafeterias and food courts.

IG Buy Kiosk is currently deployed at more than 270 customer sites across the country, including corporate cafeterias at a top five U.S. bank, a top 40 U.S. law firm, one of the nation’s largest technology manufacturers, and at a national financial services firm. Agilysys IG Buy’s intuitive guest-facing order and pay experiences transfer the control and convenience to the end user. The self-service components reduce on-site labor needed to manage venue operations, while improving guest throughput, check size, order accuracy, guest experience and satisfaction. The platform-driven and cloud-based solution allows for easy deployments and management at scale resulting in a lowered overall cost of ownership. Agilysys IG OnDemand provides a visual, interactive food and beverage ordering experience to any mobile device – phone, tablet, laptop – with a browser-based self-service experience. Using a simple, intuitive interface, guests can easily order and reorder from anywhere across the property, driving order velocity and volume. Agilysys IG OnDemand allows our customers to immediately offer an online ordering platform that is natively integrated with their physical location operations. Menus and price updates can be done in one place and automatically updated across all channels – online web store, digital menus and app ordering as well as POS terminals. Orders placed online are routed automatically to the appropriate kitchen for preparation. Orders placed from all channels are automatically available on the POS terminal at the physical location. Agilysys IG OnDemand Full Service is a complete contactless self-service F&B ordering solution that offers an intuitive guest-facing order and pay experience. IG OnDemand allows guests to place and pay for orders using their own device - phone, tablet, laptop – for pick-up or delivery orders, as well as for a tableside order and pay experience. It supports ordering for multiple guests at a table over the course of a meal using their own devices making the ordering process touchless while freeing up staff to spend more time with guests. The result is dramatically increased revenue opportunities and more chances to enhance guest service. Agilysys IG Quick Pay allows guests to use their own mobile device, scan a QR code on the InfoGenesis check, review a digital copy of the check, add a tip & initiate payment, maintaining a fully touchless guest payment experience. The product can be sold as a standalone payment solution or can be bundled with IG OnDemand for a complete order and pay experience. Agilysys IG Smart Menu provides a touchless menu display on a guest’s own mobile device - phone, tablet, laptop. Simply scan a QR code to access a venue menu that is linked directly to the actual items available in the IG OnDemand system, not a pdf or a website link. The product can be sold as a standalone menu solution or can be bundled with IG OnDemand for a complete menu, order and pay experience. Agilysys IG Digital Menu Board provides large screen menu and image display on commercial television monitors. It will display a venue menu that is linked directly to the actual items available in the IG OnDemand system, not a pdf or a website link, so it can easily reflect the latest items and pricing.

Virtual Check-in and Check-out Solutions Today’s hotels cater to guests with high expectations when it comes to technological efficiency. An emerging trend in the hotel industry that has accelerated in the COVID-19 environment where social distancing is often the norm, is the ability for guests to check themselves in or out of their room without interacting with the front desk. To that end, we offer software modules that enable this approach and are fully integrated with our core PMS solutions. Point of Sale and Property Management Ecosystem Offerings: The following solutions integrate with and are complementary to our point of sale or property management systems, or both. These solutions, for the most part, can stand alone and do not require POS or PMS to be functional. However, we lead with our core POS and PMS solutions discussed above and focus on selling these complimentary ecosystem solutions into our customer base. 8 rGuest Express - Kiosk simplifies check-in and check-out, optimizes staff productivity and enhances the guest experience by enabling a seamless self-service option for guests to use in the hotel lobby at a kiosk.

Our products have been enabling mission-critical core hospitality operations for more than four decades. Our software solutions are required to run the operations of the hospitality business and designed to drive substantial customer benefits through increased revenue, improved operational efficiency, enhanced guest experience and improved employee morale. In addition, many of our solutions enable social distancing capabilities for our customers. Our innovative software solutions described above have been purpose-built to serve the unique needs of the following hospitality verticals: casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. We operate across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. Some verticals we serve continue to face uncertainties with the COVID-19 pandemic. As more people receive vaccinations and pandemic-related restrictions continue to ease, the markets we serve are recovering and re-opening to their customers. The long-term outlook remains strong and we expect the momentum from the three years preceding the pandemic to continue building with a growing focus on social distancing and mobile applications. Prior to COVID-19, we estimated our total addressable market to be approximately $4.8 billion in annual recurring revenue opportunity. While the size of the opportunity might face pressure in an economic downturn, we feel it is still in the billions of dollars and we are only a fraction of that size. We continue to feel good about our opportunity to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the industry. Customers Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly fragmented. Human Capital As of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 1,400 employees, with approximately 63%, 30%, 3%, 3%, and 1% of our employees located in India, the United States, APAC, Canada, and EMEA, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success. Our senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses in hospitality. We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their growth and development. We offer our employees pay and benefits packages that we believe are competitive with others throughout our industry, as well as within the local markets in which we operate, and align individual performance with our success. We are committed to providing our employees with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We make all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws. All employees, directors, independent contractors, and other parties who work with Agilysys are expected to create a working environment where everyone is respected, regardless of individual differences. We believe that each of our employees' individual character, virtues, and individual experiences will leverage our ability to attract and retain quality employees, customers, and suppliers. Seasonality Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results. Competition Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support, subscription and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., Shiji, 12 Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies like Maestro. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains. Environmental Matters We believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations.

Risks Relating to Our Business Markets, Competition, and Operations Our business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions. Because we conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including in areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), political unrest, armed conflicts ( such as the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously purchased products and services. For example, our business is impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in energy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in air travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. As discussed below under “ COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time ,” our performance has been affected by these conditions associated with COVID-19 and could be further materially affected going forward if these conditions continue for an additional extended period or in other circumstances that we are unable to foresee or mitigate. Even after COVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities. Similarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which may adversely affect demand for our customers’ restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity. COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time. The global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 has resulted in disruption to our business, the hospitality industry and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led government and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, gatherings of large numbers of people, and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. Even as these restrictions have been relaxed in many parts of the world, including across the United States, they remain effective in other parts of the world and have frequently been re-imposed in many locations after having been relaxed as a result of additional outbreaks. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced demand for gaming, hotels, resorts, cruises, corporate foodservice, restaurants, university cafeterias, and stadiums and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across these hospitality industries that we serve, and in some cases, has caused the closure of our customers’ businesses. Business closures have resulted in our inability to complete certain implementations and negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue. We saw an improvement in the overall business environment and the hospitality market we serve during the second half of our fiscal 2021 (the year ended March 31, 2021) that continued through our fiscal 2022 as our customers re-opened their locations for business and our suppliers resumed operations that had been closed or reduced due to the pandemic. Based on the improved business 13 environment and our financial performance, we have resumed certain levels of spending; however, we will continue to assess spending activity as the facts and circumstances surrounding the pandemic evolve. Any resulting cost controls may have an adverse impact on our business, particularly if they remain in place for an extended period. As the pandemic has evolved, we have also adapted our pandemic response based on the conditions of the locations in which we and our customers and suppliers operate. We expect to incur additional costs to the extent we further resume business-related travel and our employees return to our office locations, the timing and extent of which remains undetermined at this time. We expect the office activity will vary significantly from region to region based on factors such as the availability of vaccines and the spread and overall impact of any new virus variants. Notwithstanding the recovery in the business environment since the early part of the pandemic, given the uncertainty associated with the pandemic, our ability to predict how it will impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results in future periods is limited. Our business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes. We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the supply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with international supply. For example, in recent years the United States has imposed and extended greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs, including on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply costs, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance. Our business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer’s needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. The development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including: Our product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will, if ever, receive significant revenues from these investments. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services. Several companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future. We compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or 14 services, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity. Our future success depends on our ability to execute on growth or strategic initiatives, properly manage investments in our business and operations, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure. Our success also depends on our ability to execute on other growth or strategic initiatives we are pursuing. A key element of our long-term strategy is to continue to invest in and grow our business and operations, both organically and through acquisitions. Investments in new markets, solutions, and technologies, R&D, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion, and headcount are critical components for achieving this strategy. In particular, we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. Our investments in research and development may result in products or services that generate less revenue than we anticipate. However, such investments and efforts present challenges and risks and may not be successful (financially or otherwise), especially in new areas in which we have little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our profitability in the short-term. To be successful in such efforts, we must be able to properly allocate limited investment funds and other resources, prioritize among opportunities, balance the extent and timing of investments with the associated impact on profitability, balance our focus between new areas and the servicing of our existing customers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas, or with the new solutions, in which we have invested. Our success also depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations. Our existing infrastructure, systems, security, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. System upgrades or new implementations can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive and we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems during or following such implementations, including among others, potential disruptions in our operations or financial reporting. If we are unable to properly execute on growth initiatives, manage our investments, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected. Our dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them. We rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs. We do not have long term agreements with many of these suppliers. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services needs from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner programs, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it may have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins. For certain products and services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant risk exposure for us. We maintain relationships with third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including cloud hosting and other cloud-based services. We make contractual obligations to customers based on these relationships and, in some cases, also entrust these providers with both our own sensitive data as well as the sensitive data of our customers (that may include sensitive guest data). If these third-party providers do not perform as expected or encounter service disruptions, cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other difficulties, we or our customers may be materially and adversely affected, including, among other things, by facing increased costs, potential liability to customers, guests, or other third parties, regulatory issues, and reputational harm. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers because of poor performance, security considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time, expense, or exposure to us, any of which could materially adversely impact our business. We also purchase hardware and technology, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our competitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established providers wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be smaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally, or in an effort to benefit our margins. If any of these providers experience financial, operational, or quality assurance difficulties, or if any cease production, or there is any other disruption in the services we or our customers receive, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a 15 competitor, macroeconomic issues like those described above (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), or otherwise, we will be required to locate and migrate to alternative sources or providers, to internally develop the applicable technologies, to redesign our products, or to remove certain features from our products or to reduce our service levels, any of which would likely increase our expenses, create delays, or negatively impact our revenues. Although we strive to establish contractual protections with key providers, such as source code escrows, warranties, and indemnities, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling or unable to stand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the event our relationship with a key provider is interrupted. If we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel, or if labor costs continue to rise, our ability to operate and grow our business may be impaired and our financial results may suffer. We depend on the services of our management and employees to continuously run and grow our business. To grow successfully, we must retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees, including in growth areas we may enter. Retention is an industry challenge given the competitive technology labor market, especially with the remote work options brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As we grow, we must also enhance and expand our workforce to execute on new and larger opportunities and challenges. The market for qualified personnel is competitive in the geographies in which we operate and may be limited especially in technology areas. We may be at a disadvantage to larger companies with greater brand recognition or financial resources or to start-ups or other emerging companies in trending market sectors. Remote employment arrangements also come with challenges, including with respect to collaboration, training, and corporate culture, especially at a significant scale. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel when and where they are needed or to manage effectively our remote workforce, our ability to operate and grow our business could be impaired. Moreover, if we are not able to properly balance our investments in personnel with revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected. While the market for talent in our industry has been competitive for many years, in recent quarters, the labor market has become even tighter, increasing the difficulty and lead time in filling open positions with qualified candidates. Ongoing labor shortages or increasing labor costs could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, especially if rising costs outpace our revenue growth. Our international operations have many associated risks. We continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and challenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. We have international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and India. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support channels in key international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and difficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and managing foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing integrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs, enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; currency fluctuations; and political and economic instability abroad. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research and development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our administrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is concentrated in our India research and development center. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our employees throughout the world have been capable of working from home for months at a time without significantly impacting our business. However, a natural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location that prevents or substantially impairs our employees’ ability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers. 16 Regulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality Cyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data against cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in the design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers. The number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including sophisticated “supply-chain” attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks, anticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained therein, our customers and ultimately, our business. These events, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations. We are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. A failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security such as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or potential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities. Our software may be used in connection with processing personal data and other sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the customer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our development and implementation processes, we cannot assure that our customers’ systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access to our software can be prevented. If a customer, or any other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach of our software, our business could be adversely affected. We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. 17 We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. Although on May 11, 2022, judgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the judgement. If we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal liability. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high quality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions, breaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions or breaches adversely impact our customers’ businesses. In addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses. While our contracts typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for errors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability. Risks Relating to the Industries We Serve Our business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Because our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business and sales are largely dependent on the health of that industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality industry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, as discussed above, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. For additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, see “ COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time ” above for additional information. Consolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business. Customers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry. Although recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance that future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider’s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services from us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Insolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business. Customers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Most of our customers have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our customers to declare bankruptcy or cause their 18 lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property. Customers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Our Finances and Capital Structure If we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits. As part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Some of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. We may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results. As of March 31, 2022, we had $32.8 million and $20.2 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis. As of March 31, 2020, we determined the net realizable value of intangible assets consisting of capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in significantly lower sales and cash flow projections for the related rGuest solutions after evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software. As a result, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future. We have incurred losses in recent years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future. We have incurred operating losses in recent years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to invest in our products. Our lack of consistent profitability limits the resources available to us to invest in developing new products, product upgrades and services and otherwise in improving business operations. Our stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. Our stock price has been volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended March 31, 2022, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a high close of $58.45 to a low close of $35.31. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: 19 On May 22, 2020, we sold $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $20.1676 per share. Dilution upon the conversion of the preferred stock in the future may negatively impact the price of our common stock. Additionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the volatility of our common share price over time. We may encounter risks associated with maintaining large cash balances. While we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts, if any. Other Risk Factors We are subject to litigation, which may be costly. As a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such litigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact on our business. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. Item 1B. Unresolv ed Staff Comments. None. Item 2. P roperties. Our corporate headquarters are located in Alpharetta, Georgia where we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space. In addition, we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, 30,000 square feet of office space in Bellevue, Washington, of which we sublease 22,000 square feet to a third party, 5,000 square feet of office space in Santa Barbara, California, and 6,000 square feet of warehouse space in Roswell, Georgia. Internationally, we lease approximately 101,000 square feet of office space in Chennai, India, 7,000 square feet in Toronto, Canada, and lease several other smaller office locations throughout Europe and Asia. Our major leases contain renewal options for periods of up to 10 years. We believe that our current facilities and office space are sufficient to meet our needs and do not anticipate any difficulty securing additional space as needed. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of any current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In December 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth 20 appealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Although on May 11, 2022, judgement was entered for us and against Ameranth on all claims in that suit, Ameranth has pending appeals that may affect the judgement. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of Ameranth’s pending appeal on their claims against us, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. Item 4. Mine Safe ty Disclosures. Not applicable. 21 Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Sha reholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Market Information Our common shares, without par value, are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “AGYS”. As of May 13, 2022, there were 1,343 registered holders of our common shares, without par value. Dividends We did not pay dividends in fiscal 2022 or 2021 on our common stock and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. We pay preferred stock dividends as described in Note 14, Preferred Stock, to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report. The current practice of the Board of Directors is to retain any available earnings for use in the operations and growth of our business, both organically and through acquisitions.

Item 6. [Reserved] 23 Item 7. Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report titled, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 3 of this Annual Report and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business during the year ended March 31, 2022. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and suppliers and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. While we have previously taken certain cost reduction measures, we may take further actions that alter our business operations in response to changes in the global environment. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums and healthcare.

Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue – Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: 25 Results of Operations Fiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021 Net Revenue and Operating Income (Loss) The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021: Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 35,956 $ 26,714 $ 9,242 34.6 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 98,958 88,565 10,393 11.7 % Professional services 27,722 21,897 5,825 26.6 % Total net revenue 162,636 137,176 25,460 18.6 % Cost of goods sold: Products 19,251 13,506 5,745 42.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 21,141 17,985 3,156 17.5 % Professional services 20,712 16,309 4,403 27.0 % Total cost of goods sold 61,104 47,800 13,304 27.8 % Gross profit $ 101,532 $ 89,376 $ 12,156 13.6 % Gross profit margin 62.4 % 65.2 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 46,332 $ 55,345 $ (9,013 ) (16.3 )% Sales and marketing 14,730 14,196 534 3.8 % General and administrative 27,734 33,273 (5,539 ) (16.6 )% Depreciation of fixed assets 2,210 2,832 (622 ) (22.0 )% Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,654 1,959 (305 ) (15.6 )% Severance and other charges 1,584 2,529 (945 ) (37.4 )% Legal settlements 969 200 769 nm Operating income (loss) $ 6,319 $ (20,958 ) $ 27,277 nm Operating income (loss) percentage 3.9 % (15.3 )% nm - not meaningful 26 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2022 2021 Net revenue: Products 22.1 % 19.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 60.8 64.6 Professional services 17.1 15.9 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.8 % 9.8 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 13.0 13.1 Professional services 12.8 11.9 Total net cost of goods sold 37.6 % 34.8 % Gross profit 62.4 % 65.2 % Operating expenses: Product development 28.4 % 40.4 % Sales and marketing 9.1 10.3 General and administrative 17.1 24.4 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.4 2.1 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1.0 1.4 Severance and other charges 1.0 1.8 Legal settlements 0.5 0.1 Operating income (loss) 3.9 % (15.3 )% Net revenue. Total revenue increased $25.5 million, or 18.6%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Products revenue increased $9.2 million, or 34.6%, due to higher sales and deliveries as our customers re-open their locations for business. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $10.4 million, or 11.7%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased 28.0% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Professional services revenue increased $5.8 million, or 26.6%, due to higher sales and service activity as our customers shift their focus to implementing technology to improve their operations. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $12.2 million, or 13.6%, in fiscal 2022 and total gross profit margin decreased from 65.2% to 62.4%. Products gross profit increased $3.5 million and gross profit margin decreased from 49.4% to 46.5% due to a higher proportion of third-party products over proprietary software revenue. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $7.2 million and gross profit margin decreased from 79.7% to 78.6% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit increased $1.4 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 25.5% to 25.3% due to continued hiring and training of new staff to meet increasing project backlogs from ongoing sales activity and certain project delays. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, severance and other charges, decreased $14.9 million, or 13.9%, in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have decreased 21.5% in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development decreased $9.0 million, or 16.3%, during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase of $4.4 million in payroll and other operating expenses as we continue to manage market compensation pressures offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $13.4 million due to significant charges resulting from accelerated vesting of stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs) upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. 27 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $0.5 million, or 3.8%, in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 due to an increase of $3.4 million in payroll, travel, advertising, promotion and other operating expenses as we invest in our sales and marketing teams and return to travel for in-person selling and increased marketing event and trade show activity offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $2.9 million due to significant charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. General and administrative. General and administrative decreased $5.5 million, or 16.6%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase of $3.7 million in payroll and other expenses after restoring base pay, employee benefits and various operational activities offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $9.2 million due to significant charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.6 million or 22.0% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles decreased $0.3 million or 15.6% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due to a lower unamortized cost base following the impairment of intangibles in fiscal 2020. Severance and other charges. Severance and other charges decreased $0.9 million due to a significant reduction in employee terminations during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Legal settlements. Legal settlements increased $0.8 million during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to an increase in settlements of employment and other business-related matters.

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense, net. Other expense, net consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Year ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Income tax expense (benefit) $ 33 $ (208 ) $ (241 ) nm Effective tax rate 0.5 % 1.0 % nm – not meaningful For fiscal 2022, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets including increases in valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. 28 Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences and have recorded a valuation allowance substantially offsetting our deferred tax assets. At March 31, 2022, we had $196.3 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $42.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $166.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2023 through 2041. Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020: Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 26,714 $ 44,230 $ (17,516 ) (39.6 )% Support, maintenance and subscription services 88,565 83,680 4,885 5.8 % Professional services 21,897 32,847 (10,950 ) (33.3 )% Total net revenue 137,176 160,757 (23,581 ) (14.7 )% Cost of goods sold: Products, inclusive of developed technology amortization 13,506 36,427 (22,921 ) (62.9 )% Support, maintenance and subscription services 17,985 19,248 (1,263 ) (6.6 )% Professional services 16,309 24,130 (7,821 ) (32.4 )% Total cost of goods sold 47,800 79,805 (32,005 ) (40.1 )% Gross profit $ 89,376 $ 80,952 $ 8,424 10.4 % Gross profit margin 65.2 % 50.4 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 55,345 $ 41,463 $ 13,882 33.5 % Sales and marketing 14,196 19,864 (5,668 ) (28.5 )% General and administrative 33,273 24,374 8,899 36.5 % Depreciation of fixed assets 2,832 2,574 258 10.0 % Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,959 2,541 (582 ) (22.9 )% Impairments — 23,740 (23,740 ) (100.0 )% Severance and other charges 2,529 582 1,947 334.5 % Legal settlements 200 (125 ) 325 (260.0 )% Operating loss $ (20,958 ) $ (34,061 ) $ 13,103 (38.5 )% Operating loss percentage (15.3 )% (21.2 )% 29 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2021 2020 Net revenue: Products 19.5 % 27.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 64.6 52.1 Professional services 15.9 20.4 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products, inclusive of developed technology amortization 9.8 % 22.6 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 13.1 12.0 Professional services 11.9 15.0 Total cost of goods sold 34.8 % 49.6 % Gross profit 65.2 % 50.4 % Operating expenses: Product development 40.4 % 25.8 % Sales and marketing 10.3 12.4 General and administrative 24.4 15.2 Depreciation of fixed assets 2.1 1.6 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1.4 1.6 Severance and other charges 1.8 0.4 Legal settlements 0.1 (0.1 ) Operating loss (15.3 )% (21.2 )% Net revenue. Total revenue decreased $23.6 million, or 14.7%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $17.5 million, or 39.6%, due to delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remained unclear during fiscal 2021. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $4.9 million, or 5.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased 15.5% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Subscription revenue sales were led by our add on software modules, including modules enabling social distancing and contactless capabilities. Professional services revenue decreased $11.0 million, or 33.3%, due to delays in implementation services due to customer property restrictions, property closures and lower sales from delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remained unclear. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $8.4 million, or 10.4%, in fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 50.4% to 65.2%. Products gross profit increased $5.4 million and gross profit margin increased from 17.6% to 49.4% driven mostly by the absence of software development cost amortization during fiscal 2021. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $6.1 million and gross profit margin increased 269 basis points to 79.7% due to increased subscription revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit decreased $3.1 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 26.5% to 25.5% due to the delay in professional service projects and the fixed costs of maintaining a minimum required professional services team as customers continued to work towards re-opening their locations and accept implementations and installations. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, impairments, severance and other charges, increased $16.8 million, or 18.5%, in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have increased 22.0% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $13.9 million, or 33.5%, during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to the continued expansion of our R&D teams and significant share-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs) upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. 30 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $5.7 million, or 28.5%, in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 due to reduced commission expense as a result of lower sales levels, significantly reduced travel, layoffs, temporary reductions in employee benefits, and the absence of in-person trade shows and conference activity. The decrease was slightly offset by an increase in stock-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $9.0 million, or 37.0%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The change is due primarily to significant share-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $0.3 million or 10.0% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles. Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles decreased $0.6 million or 22.9% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to a lower unamortized cost base following the impairment of intangibles in fiscal 2020. Impairments. There were no impairments in fiscal 2021. Impairments totaled $23.7 million in fiscal 2020. The impairments resulted from specific capitalized software development costs supporting certain software applications. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions that made it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the impacted solutions at the time of impairment determination. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. We recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero during the 2020 fiscal year. Severance and other charges. Severance and other charges increased $1.9 million due to an increase in non-restructuring severance activity during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Legal settlements. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters.

Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. At March 31, 2021, we had $199.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $46.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $165.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2022 through 2041. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, payments of preferred stock dividends, and operating expenses including payments of lease obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. We disclose our lease obligations in Note 6, Leases, and preferred stock dividends in Note 14, Preferred Stock, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report. At March 31, 2022, all $97.0 million of our cash on hand was deposited in bank accounts, of which 93% are located in the United States. We believe there is limited credit risk with respect to our cash balances. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $97.0 million as of March 31, 2022, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 28,475 $ 28,407 $ 10,575 Investing activities (25,679 ) (1,391 ) (3,447 ) Financing activities (4,901 ) 25,316 (1,116 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (104 ) 195 (130 ) (Decrease) increase in cash $ (2,209 ) $ 52,527 $ 5,882 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $28.5 million in fiscal 2022. The provision of cash was due primarily to our net income of $6.5 million adjusted for $17.7 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and an increase of $4.3 million from the changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $28.4 million in fiscal 2021. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $21.0 million adjusted for $44.0 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and an increase of approximately $5.4 million from the changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $10.6 million in fiscal 2020. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $34.1 million adjusted for $46.2 million in non-cash expense including impairment charges, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and a decrease of approximately $1.5 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities . Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 were $25.7 million due to $24.5 million in cash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired, and $1.2 million in purchases of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 were $1.4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. 32 Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 were $3.4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 were $4.9 million and primarily comprised of share repurchases of $3.0 million to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.8 million in preferred stock dividends. During fiscal 2021, the $25.3 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $7.5 million for the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.1 million in preferred stock dividends. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 were $1.1 million and primarily comprised of share repurchases to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. Investments Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies Managements’ Discussion and Analysis is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange 33 for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating the price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and bearing the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Share-based compensation. We have an equity incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, time-vested restricted shares, restricted share units, performance-vested restricted shares, and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares. We record compensation expense related to stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and stock-settled appreciation right (SSAR) grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected 34 term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 13, Share-Based Compensation , to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information about recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted and those not yet effective. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. We have assets, liabilities, and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk. We sell products and services internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements. For the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue from international operations was 7%, 8% and 9%, respectively of total revenue. The effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the 2022, 2021 and 2020 fiscal years. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies could materially impact our revenue, expenses, operating profit and net income. 35 Item 8. Financial Statemen ts and Supplementary Data.

Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilysys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule(s) included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated May 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matters The critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016. Atlanta, Georgia May 23, 2022 37 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders Agilysys, Inc. Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Agilysys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022, and our report dated May 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of ResortSuite, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting one percent and less than one percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022. As indicated in Management’s Report, ResortSuite, Inc. was acquired during 2022. Management’s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of ResortSuite, Inc. 38 Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\ accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Atlanta, Georgia May 23, 2022 39 AGILYSYS, INC.

The pandemic has created significant economic challenges as organizations and governmental authorities around the world have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border closings, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing requirements. Our customers and vendors have closed or have otherwise applied restrictions at certain sites in response to the pandemic. Similarly, we have provided remote working arrangements for our employees, limited business travel, and canceled or shifted various events to virtual attendance. We have localized our pandemic response to the countries and specific locations in which we, our customers and our vendors operate. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Agilysys, Inc. and subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity or cost method, as appropriate. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated. Use of estimates. Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19. Cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity from date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Other highly liquid investments considered cash equivalents with no established maturity date are fully redeemable on demand (without penalty) with settlement of principal and accrued interest on the following business day after instruction to redeem. Cash equivalent investments are readily convertible to cash with no penalty and can include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, money market funds and other investments. As of March 31, 2022, commercial paper cash equivalents totaled $ 15 million. We held no commercial paper as of March 31, 2021 or 2020. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs (level 2) based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. Allowance for expected credit losses. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We base our expected credit loss model on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. To help mitigate the associated credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. 45 Customer credit allowance . We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount of customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many cases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we invoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested by the customer within the terms of our contract. Inventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of related reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, if necessary, are based upon contractual provisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors, including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. Leases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are presented as Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities – current and operating lease liabilities – non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and corresponding liabilities are included in finance lease obligations – current and non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying asset, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments in exchange for the ability to use the asset for the duration of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and determined using the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing since our leases do not include an implicit interest rate. The estimated incremental borrowing rate considers market data, actual lease economic environment, and actual lease term at commencement date. The lease term may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. ROU assets include lease payments made in advance, and excludes any incentives received or initial direct costs incurred. We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which we account for as a single lease component. We also have leases which include variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred. Our variable lease payments are not based on an index or rate and therefore are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. We have elected to not recognize short term leases that have a term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities. Our short-term leases are not material and do not have a material impact on our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Additionally, we do not have any covenants, residual value guarantees, or related party transactions associated with our lease agreements. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. As of March 31, 2022 and 2021 , the carrying amount of goodwill was $ 32.8 million and $ 19.6 million, respectively. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist, based on our one reporting unit. The Company evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing its market capitalization based on its closing stock price (Level 1 input) to the book value of its equity on the annual evaluation date. Based on testing performed, the Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill has occurred for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company is also required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least annually, or when current events and circumstances require an interim assessment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Acquired intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets include identifiable customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names. We amortize the cost of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which are periods of 15 years or less, primarily on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are determined primarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows attributable to these assets to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. Long-lived assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance, repairs, and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under finance leases, which make up less than one percent of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. 46 The estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements – 7 to 30 years ; furniture – 7 to 10 years ; equipment – 3 to 10 years ; software – 3 to 10 years ; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the economic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project’s completion. Depreciation for capitalized project expenditures does not begin until the underlying project is completed. We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Our long-lived assets and impairments considerations are discussed further in Note 4, Property and Equipment, Net. Foreign currency translation. The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currencies are not in U.S. dollars are translated at the period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates during the fiscal year. The cumulative translation effects are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an operation are reflected within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency gains and losses from changes in exchange rates have not been material to our consolidated operating results. Revenue recognition. We derive revenue from the sale of products (i.e., software, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. For the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue from international operations was 7 % , 8 % and 9 %, respectively of total revenue. Our customer base is highly fragmented. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance 47 obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Comprehensive income (loss). Comprehensive income (loss) is the total of net income (loss), as currently reported under GAAP, plus other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) considers the effects of additional transactions and economic events that are not required to be recorded in determining net income (loss), but rather are reported as a separate statement of comprehensive income (loss). Fair value measurements . We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. In determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use various valuation techniques. Investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies. Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with certain former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their respective designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $ 1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated beneficiary of $ 0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities.” Additional information regarding the investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is provided in Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans . Income Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 9, Income Taxes . Advertising and Promotion Expense. We expense advertising and promotion expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense was $ 2.6 million , $ 0.4 million and $ 2.7 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively . 48 Reclassification. Certain prior year balances have been reclassed to conform to the current year presentation. Specifically, we reclassed certain employee benefit obligations from non-current to current liabilities. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities From Contracts With Customers (ASU No. 2021-08), which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 to require acquiring entities to apply ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. The ASU is intended to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability as well as the payment terms and their impact on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We adopted ASU 2021-08 during the three months ended March 31, 2022 – see Note 15, Business Combination . In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We adopted ASU 2020-06 as of April 1, 2021 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes, and is meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years . We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of April 1, 2021 with no material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 3. Revenue Recognition For in depth discussion regarding our revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 36.0 million , $ 26.7 million, and $ 44.2 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $ 126.7 million , $ 110.5 million, and $ 116.5 million during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to products and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to 49 consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 38.1 million and $ 40.9 million during fiscal 2022 and 2021. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we transferred from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 2.4 million and $ 2.0 million , respectively, to accounts receivable because the right to the transaction became unconditional. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of March 31, 2022 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. For first year support and maintenance service contracts, commission expenses are immaterial and therefore expenses as incurred. Other sales commission expenses are not material or have a period of benefit of one year or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.3 million and $ 2.9 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we expensed $ 2.5 million and $ 2.8 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 1.2 million and $ 1.4 million , respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 4. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment at March 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Furniture and equipment $ 14,632 $ 14,899 Software 16,338 16,891 Leasehold improvements 7,123 7,097 Project expenditures not yet in use 17 210 38,110 39,097 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 31,765 ) ( 30,308 ) Property and equipment, net $ 6,345 $ 8,789 Total depreciation expense on property and equipment was $ 2.2 million , $ 2.8 million, and $ 2.6 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company capitalizes internal-use software, including software used exclusively in providing services or that is only made available to customers as a software service, as property and equipment under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. Total amortization expense on capitalized internal-use software was $ 1.3 million , $ 2.0 million and $ 2.5 million during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Assets under financing leases are included in property and equipment categories above and further disclosed with Note 6. Leases . 50 5. Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs at March 31, 2022, and 2021: March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Gross Net Gross Net carrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying carrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying (In thousands) amount amortization Impairment amount amount amortization impairment amount Finite-lived intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 20,391 $ ( 10,938 ) $ — $ 9,453 $ 10,775 $ ( 10,775 ) $ — $ — Non-competition agreements 3,547 ( 2,808 ) — 739 2,700 ( 2,700 ) — — Developed technology 11,224 ( 10,440 ) — 784 10,398 ( 10,398 ) — — Trade names 1,075 ( 273 ) — 802 230 ( 230 ) — — Patented technology 80 ( 80 ) — — 80 ( 80 ) — — 36,317 ( 24,539 ) — 11,778 24,183 ( 24,183 ) — — Indefinite-lived trade names 8,400 N/A — 8,400 8,400 N/A — 8,400 Total intangible assets $ 44,717 $ ( 24,539 ) $ — $ 20,178 $ 32,583 $ ( 24,183 ) $ — $ 8,400 (In thousands) Software development costs $ 67,541 $ ( 45,535 ) $ ( 22,006 ) $ — $ 67,541 $ ( 45,535 ) $ ( 22,006 ) $ — Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $ 0.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 and zero for the years ended March 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See Note 15, Business Combination, for more information on the acquisition of finite-lived intangible assets. Estimated future amortization expense on finite-lived intangible assets is as follows: (In thousands) Estimated Amortization Expense Fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 $ 1,398 2024 1,293 2025 975 2026 975 2027 892 Thereafter 6,245 Total $ 11,778 Indefinite-lived intangible assets, comprised of our purchased trade name InfoGenesis as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 are tested for impairment upon identification of impairment indicators or at least annually. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than fair value. The InfoGenesis indefinite-lived purchased trade name impairment testing resulted in a fair value exceeding the carrying amount for the years ending March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Amortization expense related to software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $ 12.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. These charges are included as Products cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 6. Leases The majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of office equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by or associated with our active leases. As of March 31, 2022 , we have an additional operating lease that has not yet commenced of approximately $ 11.7 million. This operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2023 with a lease term of approximately eleven years . We do not have any related party leases. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that 51 are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable costs are expensed as incurred. We sublease one of our office leases located in Bellevue, Washington with a lease term that will expire during fiscal year 2024. The components of lease expenses, which are included in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, were as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Operating leases expense $ 4,752 $ 4,440 Finance lease expense: Amortization of ROU assets 17 26 Interest on lease liabilities 2 5 Total finance lease expense 19 31 Variable lease costs 463 443 Short term lease expense 140 120 Sublease income ( 782 ) ( 129 ) Total lease expense $ 4,592 $ 4,905 Other information related to leases for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was as follows: Year ended March 31, Supplemental cash flow information 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in thousands): Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 5,536 $ 5,987 Operating cash flows for finance leases 23 30 Financing cash flows for finance leases 19 24 ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands): Operating leases $ 1,314 $ 1,573 Weighted average remaining lease terms Operating leases 3.08 4.39 Finance leases 1.43 1.44 Weighted average discount rates Operating leases 7.62 % 10.51 % Finance leases 4.50 % 4.46 % The table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-cancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022: (In thousands) Operating leases (1) Finance leases Fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 5,222 5 2024 2,939 2 2025 1,846 — 2026 1,319 — 2027 880 — Thereafter — — Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments 12,206 7 Less: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease liabilities ( 1,508 ) ( 1 ) Total lease liabilities $ 10,698 $ 6 52 7.

Income Taxes For the year ended March 31, income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following: (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Income (loss) before income taxes United States $ 1,598 $ ( 26,272 ) $ ( 36,373 ) Foreign 4,913 5,063 2,507 Total income (loss) before income taxes $ 6,511 $ ( 21,209 ) $ ( 33,866 ) For the year ended March 31, income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following: (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Income tax expense (benefit) Current: Federal $ 62 $ 9 $ 59 State and local 21 30 21 Foreign 853 731 463 Deferred: Federal 12 12 11 State and local 7 32 7 Foreign ( 922 ) ( 1,022 ) ( 360 ) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 33 $ ( 208 ) $ 201 53 The following table presents the principal components of the difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for the years ended March 31: (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Income tax expense (benefit) at the US Federal statutory rate $ 1,368 $ ( 4,454 ) $ ( 7,112 ) Benefit for state taxes ( 65 ) ( 803 ) ( 856 ) Impact of foreign operations ( 819 ) ( 841 ) ( 514 ) Indefinite life assets 19 43 19 Change in valuation allowance ( 2,623 ) 7,271 8,406 Change in liability for unrecognized tax benefits 25 26 22 Share-based compensation ( 2,018 ) ( 2,232 ) ( 312 ) Global intangible low-taxed income 971 985 460 Deferred adjustments ( 260 ) ( 478 ) — Provision to return 3,438 278 ( 35 ) Other ( 3 ) ( 3 ) 123 Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 33 $ ( 208 ) $ 201 We have elected to account for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusions in the period in which they are incurred. Our tax provision includes a provision for income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where subsidiaries are profitable, but only a minimal benefit is reflected related to U.S. and certain foreign tax losses due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of future benefits from these losses. The fiscal 2022 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax benefit. The fiscal 2022 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets and the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. The fiscal 2021 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax benefit. The fiscal 2021 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets and the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, are as follows: (In thousands) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Accrued liabilities $ 7,574 $ 9,141 Allowance for expected credit losses and doubtful accounts 83 279 Federal losses and credit carryforwards 50,612 51,856 Foreign losses and credit carryforwards 2,793 2,103 State losses and credit carryforwards 11,179 11,642 Deferred revenue 193 464 Property and equipment and software amortization 416 171 Operating lease liabilities 1,489 2,694 Goodwill and other intangible assets 607 1,889 Other 163 90 75,109 80,329 Less: valuation allowance ( 69,515 ) ( 74,631 ) Total 5,594 5,698 Deferred tax liabilities: Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 1,269 ) ( 2,312 ) Goodwill and other intangible assets ( 2,575 ) ( 2,514 ) Other ( 15 ) 7 Total ( 3,859 ) ( 4,819 ) Total deferred tax assets, net $ 1,735 $ 879 At March 31, 2022, we had $ 196.3 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $ 42.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. Our Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia subsidiaries have $ 0.4 million , $ 0.1 million , $ 0.2 million and $ 0.1 million of net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia can be carried forward indefinitely. Our 54 India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5 years of operations which includes fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is then subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during the second five years of operations which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. The aggregate value of the benefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $ 2.6 million as of March 31, 2022. The Company has paid minimum alternative taxes during the period of regular tax relief resulting in a credit of $ 2.0 million as of March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022 we also had $ 166.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2023 through 2041. We recorded valuation allowances related to certain deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2022, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $ 69.5 million was comprised of $ 68.6 million for federal and state deferred tax assets, and $ 0.9 million associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Australia. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code. Because of our losses in recent periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $ 17.1 million and $ 8.4 million as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we will invest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign acquisitions and expansion. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable. We recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions. The aggregate changes in the balance of our uncertain tax positions were as follows for the years ended March 31: (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Balance at April 1 $ 575 $ 575 $ 580 Reductions relating to lapse in statute — — ( 5 ) Balance at March 31 $ 575 $ 575 $ 575 As of March 31, 2022, we had a liability of $ 0.6 million related to uncertain tax positions, the recognition of which would affect our effective income tax rate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. We recognize interest accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $ 0.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. As of March 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $ 1.2 million and $ 1.0 million, respectively, of interest and penalties accrued in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the U.S. we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five years. Although we have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open from 2006 forward due to attribute carryforwards. The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2015 forward in certain state 55 jurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years. Years beginning after 2011 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) The CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2022. 10. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans We maintain 401(k) plans for employees located in the United States meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, and we match 100 % of the first 1% of the employee's pre-tax contributions and 50 % of the next 5% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. We may also make discretionary contributions each year for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. Agilysys matching contributions were $ 1.4 million , $ 0.1 million , and $ 1.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We also maintain defined contribution retirement plans for employees located in the United Kingdom and in the Asia Pacific region in accordance with local statutory requirements and business practices. Defined Benefit Plan We maintain a defined benefit retirement plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees of our India subsidiary in accordance with local statutory requirements and business practices. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The Gratuity Plan is unfunded with obligation amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Employee benefit obligations” within “Other non-current liabilities” and ""Salaries, wages, and related benefits"" within ""Accrued liabilities"". Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agilysys provides certain former executives with life insurance benefits through endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 , the cash surrender value of $ 1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiaries of $ 0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities."" Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies related to gains and losses incurred on these investments are classified within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a gain of $ 13,000 , $ 31,000 and $ 14,000 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 , respectively, related to the corporate-owned life insurance policies. 11. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Contingencies We are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of any current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the 56 one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In December 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth appealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 11, 2022, in accordance with its prior rulings, the District Court entered judgment in favor of us and against Ameranth on all claims asserted against us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of Ameranth’s pending appeal on their claims against us, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 12. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Year Ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 6,478 $ ( 21,001 ) $ ( 34,067 ) Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs — ( 1,031 ) — Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 1,836 ) ( 1,576 ) — Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 4,642 $ ( 23,608 ) $ ( 34,067 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,357 23,458 23,233 Dilutive SSARs 1,063 — — Dilutive unvested restricted shares 63 — — Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,483 23,458 23,233 Income (loss) per share - basic: $ 0.19 $ ( 1.01 ) $ ( 1.47 ) Income (loss) per share - diluted: $ 0.18 $ ( 1.01 ) $ ( 1.47 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 1,736 4,228 1,510 Basic income (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 147,973 , 132,198 and 208,581 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs"") and unvested restricted shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 13. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. 57 We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and performance share grants. For SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition. Restricted shares, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted shares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying grants. We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Product development 8,186 21,634 2,241 Sales and marketing 1,355 4,254 321 General and administrative 5,008 14,206 2,643 Total share-based compensation expense 14,549 40,093 5,205 Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. We use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of service condition SSARs. There were no service condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2022. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing service condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate 0.31 % 1.38 %- 1.74 % Expected life (in years) 4 4.5 - 5 Expected volatility 42.99 % 31.7 %- 32.42 % Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 22.57 $ 10.01 The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected life of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be 58 outstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded vesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date. We use a Lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of market condition SSARs. There were no market condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2022. The following table summarizes the principal valuation assumptions utilized and the resulting fair value of market condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate over contractual term 0.60 % 1.40 % Expected volatility 40.00 % 31.70 % Suboptimal exercise factor 2.50x 3.0x Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 19.55 $ 9.60 The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2022 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted- Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2021 3,068,253 $ 20.90 Granted — — Exercised ( 839,068 ) 12.86 Forfeited ( 55,599 ) 20.02 Cancelled/expired ( 647 ) 14.22 Outstanding at March 31, 2022 2,172,939 $ 24.02 4.4 $ 34,454 Exercisable at March 31, 2022 1,462,262 $ 23.75 4.3 $ 23,590 Vested and expected to vest at March 31, 2022 2,172,939 $ 24.02 4.4 $ 34,454 The following table presents additional information related to SSARs activity during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Compensation expense $ 10,030 $ 35,808 $ 1,666 Total intrinsic value of SSARs exercised $ 34,437 $ 25,153 $ 519 Total fair value of SSARs vesting $ 6,439 $ 31,380 $ 1,328 As of March 31, 2022, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested service condition SSARs was $ 3.8 million , which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 1.0 years. A total of 636,238 shares, net of 31,513 shares withheld to cover the employee’s minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury shares to settle SSARs exercised during the twelve months ended March 31, 2022. The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares. Restricted Shares We use a Lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of restricted shares subject to a market condition. There were no restricted shares subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2021 or 2020. The following table summarizes the principal valuation assumptions utilized and the resulting fair value of restricted shares subject to a market condition granted in fiscal 2022: 2022 Risk-free interest rate over contractual term 0.5 % - 0.9 % Expected volatility 54.0 % - 56.0 % Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 24.77 - $ 39.12 59 We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted shares are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2021 132,198 $ 37.67 Granted 123,543 43.69 Vested ( 96,214 ) 36.74 Forfeited ( 10,614 ) 38.92 Outstanding at March 31, 2022 148,913 $ 43.56 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares includes grants subject only to a service condition and certain grants subject to both a service condition and a market condition. During fiscal 2022, a total of 147,900 shares were issued from treasury. The following table presents additional information related to restricted share activity during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020: (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Compensation expense $ 4,339 $ 4,105 $ 3,232 Total fair value of restricted share vesting $ 3,297 $ 7,554 $ 3,491 As of March 31, 2022, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted shares was $ 4.5 million , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.2 years. We do not include restricted shares in the calculation of earnings per share until the shares are vested. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we grant common shares to our Chief Executive Officer that vest immediately. Once attainment of the performance conditions becomes probable, we recognize compensation expense related to performance shares ratably over the performance period. The number of performance shares granted will be based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date and settlement date, which are the same under the 2020 plan. Based on the performance conditions achieved as they relate to our annual bonus plan, management estimates a liability of $ 0.2 million as of March 31, 2022, to be settled through the granting and vesting of performance shares after March 31, 2022 . We recognized compensation expense related to performance shares of $ 0.2 million in each of the fiscal years ending March 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 14. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Accounting Policy 60 We classify convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption clauses that are at the election of the Holders. We increase the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value (described below) for all undeclared dividends using the interest method. The Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights, preferences and restrictions (the Certificate of Designation included as Exhibit 3.3 to our Current Report on Form 8-K on February 9, 2022, which superseded the Certificate of Amendment included as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 26, 2020, when we converted to a Delaware corporation in February 2022, defines all terms not otherwise defined below): Voting The Holders are entitled to one vote for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock upon all matters presented to the common shareholders of the Company , and except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or required by law, the Holders and common shareholders will vote together as one class on all matters. Additionally, certain matters specific to the Convertible Preferred Stock will require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. Liquidation Preference Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the “Liquidation Preference”) and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Redemption On and after the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock was initially issued, the Company will have the right, and the Holders will have the right to require the Company, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the then-outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference. Conversion Each Holder has the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as described in the Certificate of Designation). Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023 , the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is at least 150 % of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert. Dividends The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. The Holders are not entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis; however, certain anti-dilution adjustments to the Convertible Preferred Stock may be made in the event of such dividends. The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Change in Control Events Upon certain change of control events involving the Company, the Company has the right, and each Holder has the right, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its then-outstanding shares of Convertible 61 Preferred Stock for cash consideration equal to (i) 150% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring prior to the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, (ii) 125% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the third anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and (iii) 100% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued. Standstill Restrictions The Purchaser and its affiliates are subject to certain customary standstill provisions that restrict them from, among other actions, acquiring additional securities of the Company if such acquisition would result in the Purchaser beneficially owning in excess of 25 % of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company until the later of the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and the date on which the Purchaser no longer has record or beneficial ownership of common stock and Convertible Preferred Stock that constitute at least 10 % of the outstanding common stock. 15. Business Combination On January 5, 2022 (the acquisition date), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a Canada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The consolidated financial statements include the results of ResortSuite’s operations since the acquisition date. The acquisition extends our solutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The purchase price consisted of $ 22.6 million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand, partially offset by $ 0.3 million of ResortSuite’s cash received in the acquisition, and $ 2.2 million of cash paid in March for certain ResortSuite tax liabilities resulting in net cash consideration of $ 24.5 million. We allocated the purchase price for ResortSuite to the intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. We determined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach, which discounts the expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. In accordance with ASU No. 2021-08, we applied Topic 606 to record certain customer accounts receivable and the contract liabilities assumed in the acquisition, which consisted of undelivered performance obligations under customer contracts. We adopted ASU 2021-08 early as permitted. As a result, in allocating the purchase price, we recorded $ 2.8 million of contract liabilities, representing the revenue that will be recognized as the underlying performance obligations are delivered. The following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of ResortSuite: (In thousands) Total Components of Purchase Price: Cash $ 24,800 Total purchase price $ 24,800 Allocation of Purchase Price: Net tangible assets (liabilities): Accounts receivable, net $ 2,025 Other current assets, including cash acquired 519 Other assets 567 Current and other liabilities ( 768 ) Contract liabilities ( 2,835 ) Net tangible assets (liabilities) ( 492 ) Identifiable intangible assets: Customer relationships 9,634 Non-competition agreements 848 Developed technology 827 Trade names 846 Total identifiable intangible assets 12,155 Goodwill 13,137 Total purchase price allocation $ 24,800 62 We assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names estimated useful lives of 15 years , two years , five years , and five years , respectively, the weighted average of which is approximately 12.7 years. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives. The goodwill recognized in the ResortSuite purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve a broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 13.1 million of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The Company recognized acquisition costs of $ 0.5 million related to the acquisition of ResortSuite, consisting primarily of professional fees, during the year ended March 31, 2022. The consolidated statement of operations includes these costs in severance and other charges. Revenue attributable to ResortSuite included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2022 was $ 1.3 million. Net income (loss) was not material. The pro forma impact of the business combination during the two years ended March 31, 2022 was not material to our historical consolidated operating results and is therefore not presented. We have prepared the purchase price allocation for ResortSuite on a preliminary basis. Changes to the allocation may occur as additional information becomes available during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Effective April 1, 2022, ResortSuite became Agilysys Canada, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc. 16. Subsequent Events None. 17. Related Party Transaction See Note 14.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Agilysys, under the supervision of the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision of our CEO and CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In performing the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, because we acquired ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”) in a business combination on January 5, 2022 as described in Part II, Item 8, Note 15, Business Combination, to our consolidated financial statements, our management has excluded the operations of ResortSuite in accordance with the SEC’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of the evaluation for a period of up to one year following the acquisition. Total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired) and revenue subject to ResortSuite’s internal control over financial reporting represented approximately 1% and less than 1% of our consolidated total assets and revenue, respectively, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation, management concluded that Agilysys maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022. Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued their report regarding Agilysys' internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2022, which is included elsewhere in this annual report. Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant portions of our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. While we continue to adapt our work model in response to the ongoing global pandemic, we believe our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be effective. Item 9B.

The reference on the cover of the Original Filing to the incorporation by reference to portions of our definitive proxy statement into Part III of the Original Filing is hereby deleted. In accordance with Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Part III, Items 10 through 14 of the Original Filing are hereby amended and restated in their entirety, and Part IV, Item 15 of the Original Filing is hereby amended and restated in its entirety, with the only changes being the addition of Exhibits 31.4, 31.5 and 31.6 filed herewith and related footnotes.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Corporate Governance Guidelines The Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) adopted by our board of directors are intended to provide a sound framework to assist the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibilities to shareholders. Under the Guidelines, the board of directors exercises its role in overseeing the Company by electing qualified and competent officers and by monitoring the performance of the Company. The Guidelines state that the board of directors and its committees exercise oversight of executive officer compensation and director compensation, succession planning, director nominations, corporate governance, financial accounting and reporting, internal controls, strategic and operational issues, and compliance with laws and regulations. The Guidelines also state the board of directors’ policy regarding eligibility for the board of directors, including director independence and qualifications for director candidates, events that require resignation from the board of directors, service on other public company boards of directors, and stock ownership guidelines. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews the Guidelines and makes recommendations for changes to the board of directors. The Guidelines are available on our website at www.agilysys.com , under Investor Relations. Code of Business Conduct The Code of Business Conduct adopted by our board of directors applies to all directors, officers, and employees of the Company, as well as certain third parties, and incorporates additional ethics standards applicable to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other senior financial officers of the Company, and any person performing a similar function. The Code of Business Conduct is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee, and recommendations for change are submitted to the board of directors for approval. The Code of Business Conduct is available on our website at www.agilysys.com , under Investor Relations. The Company has in place a reporting hotline and website available for use by all employees and third parties, as described in the Code of Business Conduct. Any employee or third-party can anonymously report potential violations of the Code of Business Conduct through the hotline or website, both of which are managed by an independent third party. Reported violations are promptly reported to and investigated by the Company. Reported violations are addressed by the Company and, if related to accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, the Audit Committee. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law or NASDAQ listing standards concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of the Code of Business Conduct. Audit Committee The Audit Committee held eight meetings during fiscal year 2021. The Audit Committee reviews, with our independent registered public accounting firm, the proposed scope of our annual audits and audit results, as well as interim reviews of quarterly reports; reviews the adequacy of internal financial controls; reviews internal audit functions; is directly responsible for the appointment, determination of compensation, retention, and general oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm; reviews related person transactions; oversees the Company’s implementation of its Code of Business Conduct; and reviews any concerns identified by either the internal or external auditors. The board of directors determined that all Audit Committee members (Ms. Jones and Messrs. Colvin and Mutch) are financially literate and independent under NASDAQ listing standards for audit committee members. The board of directors also determined that each of Ms. Jones and Messrs. Colvin and Mutch qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” under SEC rules. Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“Nominating Committee”) held three meetings during fiscal year 2021. The board of directors determined that all Nominating Committee members are independent under NASDAQ listing standards. The Nominating Committee assists the board of directors in finding and nominating qualified people for election to the board; reviewing shareholder-recommended nominees; assessing and evaluating the board of directors’ effectiveness; and establishing, implementing, 7 and overseeing our governance programs and policies. The Nominating Committee is responsible for reviewing the qualifications of, and recommending to the board of directors, individuals to be nominated for membership on the board of directors. The Nominating Committee will consider shareholder-recommended nominees for membership on the board of directors. There have been no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend nominees to the board of directors since those procedures were described in the Company’s proxy statement filed with the SEC on October 23, 2020 . SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and certain of its executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Company’s common shares to file reports of and changes in ownership with the SEC. Based solely on the Company’s review of copies of SEC filings it has received or filed, the Company believes that each of its directors, executive officers, and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the shares satisfied the Section 16(a) filing requirements during fiscal year 2021, other than: Mr. Badger filed a Form 4 on June 4, 2020, which was 1 day late due to the Company’s delay in calculating shares withheld to satisfy withholding taxes; Mr. Jacks filed a Form 4 on November 13, 2020, which was 1 day late due to his delay reporting the details of the transaction to the Company; Mr. Wood filed a Form 3 on November 23, 2020, which should have been filed by June 3, 2020, due to several failures of the Company during that time to obtain filer codes on Mr. Wood’s behalf, partly as a result of changes of processes and inability to work in the office as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and Mr. DeMarinis filed a Form 4 on February 17, 2021, which was 1 day late due to his delay in reporting the details of the transaction to the Company. 8 Item 11. Executive Compensation. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION None of the members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2021 (Messrs. Jones, Kaufman, Keating, and Mutch) is or has been an officer or employee of the Company or has had any relationship with the Company required to be disclosed as a related person transaction, and none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) or board of any company that employed any member of our Compensation Committee or our board of directors during fiscal year 2021. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION During fiscal year 2021, the board of directors approved compensation for non-employee directors consisting of the following: • $30,000 annual cash retainer for each non-employee director; • $35,000 annual cash retainer for the chairman of the board; • $15,000 annual cash retainer for the chairman of the Audit Committee; • $12,500 annual cash retainer for the chairman of the Compensation Committee; • $7,500 annual cash retainer for the chairman of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee; • $10,000 annual cash retainer for each member of the Audit, Nominating & Corporate Governance, and Compensation Committees, including each chairman; and • An award of restricted shares to each non-employee director valued at $75,000 on the grant date. As a response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the hospitality industry, the board reduced the cash retainer amounts set forth above by fifty percent (50%) for the first six months of fiscal year 2021. We also reimburse our directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred for attendance at board of directors and committee meetings. The fiscal year 2021 equity award for each director consisted of 4,388 restricted shares, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $17.09 on the date the grant was approved by the board of directors, and was granted under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan subject to shareholder approval of the Plan at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The restricted shares vested on March 31, 2021, and provided for pro-rata vesting upon retirement prior to March 31, 2021. Our directors are subject to share ownership guidelines that require ownership of common stock with a market value of three times the director’s respective annual cash retainer within two years of service and six times the director’s respective annual cash retainer within four years of service. We pay no additional fees for board of director or committee meeting attendance.

The closing price of the Company’s common stock on November 19, 2020, was $39.65. 9 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the “CD&A”) describes our executive compensation philosophy and programs for our Named Executive Officers during fiscal year 2021, being the year beginning April 1, 2020, and continuing through March 31, 2021. Compensation arrangements with our Named Executive Officers are governed by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors. Our Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2021 consisted of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), our former CFO, and our three other most highly compensated officers during fiscal year 2021, as listed below: • Ramesh Srinivasan, President and CEO • Tony Pritchett, our former Vice President and CFO • Dave Wood, Vice President and CFO • Kyle Badger, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary • Prabuddha Biswas, Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer • Don DeMarinis, Senior Vice President Sales, Americas Each of the Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Wood were also Named Executive Officers in the prior fiscal year and continued in their positions for fiscal year 2021. Mr. Pritchett resigned as our CFO, and Mr. Wood was promoted to the role of CFO , effective June 1, 2020, during fiscal year 2021. For fiscal year 2021, Mr. Pritchett earned $49,900 in base salary, based on his compensation level set in the prior fiscal year, was not eligible for an annual incentive and received no long-term equity awards. Accordingly, this CD&A omits any discussion of his compensation for fiscal year 2021. See the Summary Compensation Table and the notes thereto on page 18 for further details on Mr. Pritchett’s compensation in fiscal year 2021. Compensation Focus for Fiscal Year 2021 The global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 had a significant impact on our business, the hospitality industry and the global economy during fiscal year 2021. In response to the pandemic, we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency, which included benefit limitations and decreases in salaries that substantially reduced cash compensation for the Named Executive Officers and our other executives and senior employees. The compensation structure for our Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2021 was similar to the compensation structure for Named Executive Officers in recent prior years. Our CEO’s compensation includes base salary and an annual incentive based on company financial performance that is settled in shares of common stock. The compensation for our other Named Executive Officers includes base salary, annual cash incentives based on company financial performance, and long-term equity incentives. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, at the beginning of fiscal year 2021, we implemented a six-month reduction in base salary for most senior employees, including a 30% reduction in base salary for executives. Ramesh Srinivasan, our CEO, voluntarily took no base salary for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2021. After considering the results of our recent votes on Named Executive Officer compensation, which confirmed the Company’s general philosophy and objectives relative to our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee continued to link executive pay to performance and maintained annual incentive opportunities for the Named Executive Officers generally at the same level as fiscal year 2021. Annual incentive performance targets for fiscal year 2021 were well in the process of being determined at the onset of the pandemic, and given the difficulties of predicting the impact of the pandemic on our business at that time, we continued our practice of focusing annual incentive performance targets on improvements over fiscal year 2020 results. As in prior years, the annual incentive for our CEO, while based on the same company financial measures as the annual incentives for the other Named Executive Officers, was settled in shares of common stock to further align the CEO with shareholder interests and to emphasize long term value creation. In fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee increased the value of long-term equity incentive awards to all participants, including the Named Executive Officers, compared to recent prior years, to bolster retention at a time when it appeared that the hospitality industry and the Company would be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed below under the heading Fiscal Year 2021 Compensation, a significant portion of the long-term incentives awarded to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2021 would vest only upon the attainment of more than a 100% increase in the market price of the Company’s common stock. Our CEO did not receive any long-term equity incentive award in fiscal year 2021 since he received a large award upon the renewal of his employment agreement at the end of fiscal year 2020. 10 Compensation Philosophy, Objectives, and Structure Our Compensation Committee adopted its pay philosophy, objectives, and structure for Named Executive Officers to achieve financial and business goals and create long-term shareholder value. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives . For fiscal year 2021, given the potential impact of the pandemic on the hospitality industry and our business, our Compensation Committee’s pay philosophy was to reduce cash compensation and emphasize long-term performance-based compensation in the form of long-term equity incentives. The Compensation Committee’s objective was to establish an overall compensation package to: • Tie a significant portion of compensation to the long-term performance of our common shares; • Reward the achievement of business objectives approved by our board of directors; • Provide a rational, consistent, and competitive executive compensation program that is well understood by those to whom it applies; and • Retain, and motivate executives who could significantly contribute to our success. Compensation Structure . Our compensation structure is comprised of: Base Salary — Base salary provides fixed pay levels aimed to attract and retain executive talent. Variations in salary levels among Named Executive Officers are based on each executive’s roles and responsibilities, experience, functional expertise, relation to peer pay levels, competitive assessments, individual performance, and changes in salaries in the overall general market and for all employees of the Company. Salaries are reviewed annually by our Compensation Committee, and changes in salary are based on these factors and input from our CEO, other than for himself. None of the factors are weighted according to any specific formula. Salaries for new executive officers are generally based on the Compensation Committee’s discretion and judgment but may be based on any of the above-mentioned relevant factors. Annual Incentives — Annual incentives provide cash variable pay for achievement of the Company’s financial goals, with target incentives set as a percentage of salary, and are designed to reward achievement of goals with an annual cash payment. At the end of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee considers the aggregate compensation of each Named Executive Officer and may adjust the annual incentive payment otherwise earned if the aggregate compensation is deemed deficient or excessive in the opinion and discretion of the Compensation Committee. Annual incentives for our CEO are settled in shares of common stock, instead of cash. Long-Term Incentives — Long-term incentives are variable, equity incentives designed to drive improvements in performance that build wealth and create long-term shareholder value by tying the value of earned incentives to the long-term performance of our common shares. Target long-term incentives are also set as a percentage of salary. Compensation Key Considerations Annual Goal Setting . Annual goals for our Named Executive Officers may be tied to our financial, strategic, and operational goals and may include business specific financial targets relating to our goals. For fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee linked annual incentive goals to financial targets emphasizing both growth and profitability. Annual incentives were based on revenue growth, but payment was conditioned upon the achievement of a minimum adjusted EBITDA and a minimum end of year cash balance. Variable Pay at Risk . Our compensation philosophy drives the provision of greater at-risk pay to our Named Executive Officers, and variable pay at risk comprised between 50% and 69% of target annual compensation for the Named Executive Officers. Our Named Executive Officers have significant opportunities for long-term, equity-based incentive compensation, as our philosophy is to tie a significant portion of compensation to the long-term performance of our common shares. Thus, significant emphasis is placed on long-term shareholder value creation, thereby we believe minimizing excessive risk taking by our executives. The Compensation Committee, in consultation with management, evaluates our incentive plans to determine if the plans’ measures or goals encourage inappropriate risk-taking by our employees. As part of its evaluation, the Compensation Committee determined that the performance measures and goals were tied to our business, financial, and strategic objectives. As such, the incentive plans are believed not to encourage risk-taking outside of the range of risks contemplated by the Company’s business plan. Compensation Consultants and Competitive Market Assessments . The Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant and did not rely on any market assessment of compensation in setting compensation for fiscal year 2021. Tally Sheets . Our Compensation Committee analyzed tally sheets at the beginning of the fiscal year to review overall compensation and pay mix for each Named Executive Officer. Tally sheets included a three-year look-back of total compensation, including annual cash compensation, long-term incentive awards granted and earned, and benefits and perquisites. Tally sheets also included a cumulative inventory of equity grants by fiscal year, including the value of outstanding equity at the Company’s then current stock price and the value received for prior vesting and exercises of equity. The tally sheets brought together, in one place, all elements of Named Executive 11 Officers’ actual compensation and information about wealth accumulation so that our Compensation Committee could analyze the individual elements, the mix of compensation and the aggregate total amount of annual and accumulated compensation. Tally sheets were also used by the Committee to evaluate internal pay equity among the Named Executive Officers and to determine the impact of employment termination or change of control events. In support of the philosophy of rewarding performance, tally sheets are used by the Compensation Committee to review compensation as compared to expectations, and our Compensation Committee determined that annual compensation set for our Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2021 was consistent with expectations and with the established compensation philosophy and pay mix guidelines driven by that philosophy. Fiscal Year 2021 Compensation Base Salary . For fiscal year 2021, stated base salary for the Named Executive Officers did not change from fiscal year 2020, and in order to conserve cash during the COVID-19 pandemic, the base salary of each of the Named Executive Officers was reduced by 30% for the first six months of the fiscal year. Mr. Srinivasan voluntarily agreed to accept no base salary for the first nine months of the fiscal year. Mr. Wood was appointed CFO in fiscal year 2021, and the Committee set his annual base salary at $240,000, subject to the 30% reduction discussed above, which was the level the Committee believed to be competitive for his position and necessary to retain him in his role. The Committee based their assessments on the recommendation of the CEO and their own experience and judgement. Annual Incentives . Annual Incentive Targets . The Compensation Committee set fiscal year 2021 annual incentive goals at the beginning of the fiscal year when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business was difficult to predict. As previously discussed, the Committee linked the annual incentive goals of the Named Executive Officers to revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and cash balance. All the Named Executive Officers were subject to the same annual incentive structure: • 100% of target annual incentives were based on the Company’s achievement of a fiscal year 2021 revenue target of $165 million; • provided that Adjusted EBITDA after payment of annual incentives was not less than $14M; • provided, further, that the Company’s balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal year 2021, was at least $40 million, exclusive of any offering proceeds or borrowings. Component Weighting (%) Threshold Target Maximum Amount Payout (% of target incentive) Amount Payout (% of target incentive) Amount Payout (% of target incentive) Revenue 100 $155M 30 $165M 100 $185M 150 Achievement would be scaled between the threshold level and the target level and between the target level and the maximum level. Payouts were capped at 150% of target incentives. If either the Adjusted EBITDA or cash balance conditions were not achieved, then the annual incentives would not be earned. Due to the uncertain impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of the fiscal year, the Committee also allowed for up to 30% achievement, in their discretion, if the threshold level of revenue was not met, provided that the Adjusted EBITDA and cash balance conditions were met. For fiscal year 2021, the Committee continued to believe that revenue growth was most accretive to shareholder value. The Committee imposed the Adjusted EBITDA and cash balance conditions in order to encourage disciplined management of Company expenses and profitable growth . Given the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry and our business, the Compensation Committee believed that the plan involved performance that was extraordinarily difficult at the target levels and at the maximum level being achievable only if the COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly had little to no impact on our business. Annual Incentive Results . Total revenue decreased $23.6 million, or 14.7%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Fiscal year 2021 revenue was $137.2 million, compared to 160.6 million in fiscal year 2020, and well below the $155 million threshold level for annual incentive achievement. Notwithstanding the failure to achieve the threshold revenue target, the Committee believed the Company had significantly exceeded expectations with respect to growing Adjusted EBITDA and cash balance despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjusted EBITDA grew 105% over fiscal year 2020, and cash balance grew 40% over fiscal year 2020, excluding the proceeds of the offering of Convertible Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the Committee used its discretion to certify 30% achievement of annual incentive targets. 12 Component Result Target Achievement Revenue $137.2M $165.0M 30% Adjusted EBITDA $26.7M $14.0 Achieved Cash Balance $65.2M $40.0M Achieved CEO Annual Incentive . Mr. Srinivasan was eligible for an annual incentive for fiscal year 2021 based on the Company financial performance metrics described above, with any such earned incentive to be settled in shares of common stock. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Srinivasan’s target annual incentive for fiscal year 2021 was set at 100% of his base salary, or $600,000, with a maximum potential incentive of $900,000 (150% of his base salary), payable upon achievement of 150% of the annual incentive goals, and a threshold potential incentive of $300,000 (50% of his target annual incentive), payable upon achievement of 50% of the annual incentive goals. Based on the fiscal year 2021 results discussed above, Mr. Srinivasan earned 30%, or $180,000, of his annual incentive target. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Srinivasan 3,403 shares of common stock, being the number of shares having a value of $180,000 based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on May 26, 2021, the date that the Committee made its determination. Annual Incentives for the Other Named Executive Officers . Fiscal year 2021 target annual incentives for the other Named Executive Officers other than Mr. DeMarinis, were set as 50% of the executive’s base salary. Mr. DeMarinis’ annual incentive was set as 60% of his base salary, and he was also eligible for target annual incentives of $150,000 for commissions and other sales-related incentives due to his role as head of our Americas Sales teams. Annual incentives comprised 18% to 31% of total fiscal year 2021 target compensation for these Named Executive Officers.

Based on the fiscal year 2021 results discussed above, each of the Named Executive Officers earned 30% of their target annual incentives subject to the annual incentive plan described above. Mr. DeMarinis earned an additional $75,350 of his target $150,000 sales incentives based on the net gross profit of eligible sales.

As with the annual cash incentives, the Compensation Committee approved fiscal year 2021 long-term incentive (“LTI”) awards for the Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Srinivasan at the beginning of the year when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the outcome for the fiscal year were substantially uncertain. LTI awards to these Named Executive Officers consisted of stock-settled appreciation rights (“SSARs”) and restricted shares. Mr. Srinivasan did not receive any long-term equity incentive award in fiscal year 2021 since he received a large award upon the renewal of his employment agreement at the end of fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, the Compensation Committee increased the value of long-term equity incentive awards to all participants, including the Named Executive Officers, compared to recent prior years, to bolster retention at a time when it appeared that the hospitality industry and the Company would be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there were insufficient shares remaining under the Company’s shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan to complete the proposed grants, and the grants were 13 made by the Committee subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2020 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on November 19, 2020. With respect to the LTI awards, the Committee considered various alternatives. While annual incentives target specific performance goals, the Committee’s focus with LTI awards has been to link compensation directly to shareholder gains. SSARs provided the direct link between compensation and shareholder gains in a less dilutive manner than traditional stock options. In addition, restricted shares tie compensation to shareholder gains and highly bolster retention over the three-year vesting period. The Committee had awarded Mr. Srinivasan a grant of 600,000 SSARs at the time his employment agreement with the Company was extended in February 2020, near the end of fiscal year 2020, which included 125,000 SSARs that would best upon the closing price of the Company’s common stock attaining $45 per share. In June 2020, during the annual compensation review, the Committee desired to give the other Named Executive Officers a meaningful number of SSARs with the same equity performance target as Mr. Srinivasan in order to focus the entire management team on the goal of increasing shareholder value. The Committee believed the $45 target share price continued to be appropriate especially since the Company’s closing stock price had dropped from a then all-time high of $36.85 on February 13, 2020, near the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, to average less than $20 per share from February 24, 2020, through June 2, 2020, when the grants were awarded. In order to achieve the target, the closing price must have averaged at least $45 per share over a 10 consecutive trading day period. This target was achieved on February 11, 2021. In setting LTI awards for the Named Executive Officers, the Committee received input and recommendations from our CEO, and at his recommendation set LTI awards for the Named Executive Officers at 125% of their base salaries, with the value of 25% of base salary being allocated to restricted common stock vesting in even amounts over three years, the value of 50% of base salary being allocated to SSARs vesting in even amounts over three years, and the value of 50% of base salary being allocated to SSARs vesting upon the closing price of the Company’s common stock attaining $45 per share for ten consecutive trading days prior to June 30, 2023. Awards of restricted common stock were based on the closing price of our common stock on June 2, 2020, the date the Committee granted the awards subject to shareholder approval, $20.02, awards of time vesting SSARs were based on the Black-Scholes option pricing value of our common stock on June 2, 2020, $7.12, and awards of the performance vesting SSARs were based on the Lattice option pricing model that utilizes a binomial tree to forecast option pricing as of June 2, 2020, $3.07.

Due to rounding down to avoid fractional shares, the actual values of LTI awards received were less than the amounts stated in this table. LTI awards comprised between 38% and 45% of total fiscal year 2021 target compensation for these Named Executive Officers. The restricted shares vest in annual one-third increments on March 31, 2021 and 2022 and the remainder in equal quarterly increments on each of June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2023. The time-vesting SSARs vest in 20% increments on March 31, 2021, and 2022 and in 15% increments on each of June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2023. All of the SSARs have seven-year terms, are settled in common shares upon exercise, and were granted at an exercise price of $20.02, the closing price of the common shares on the date awarded by the Committee. Because the awards were subject to shareholder approval of our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, the value of the awards for purposes of stock compensation expense was determined on November 19, 2020, the date that shareholder approval was obtained. The closing price of our common stock on November 19, 2020, was $39.65, a 98% increase in value over the $20.02 closing price of our common stock on 14 June 2, 2020, which had the effect of significantly increasing the recorded stock compensation expense for the LTI awards over the expected compensation expense as of the date the awards were granted on June 2, 2020. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 18 for the values expensed. Additional Compensation – Executive Benefits . We provide executive benefits to our Named Executive Officers including additional life and long-term disability insurance plans. From time to time, Named Executive Officers also may participate in supplier sponsored events. Executive benefits are further described in the Summary Compensation Table. We believe these benefits enhance the competitiveness of our overall executive compensation package. We have, however, limited executive benefits offered to reduce compensation costs. Additionally, welfare benefits offered to our Named Executive Officers are the same level of benefits offered to all Company employees. Employment Agreements and Change of Control The material termination and change of control provisions of various agreements are summarized below for each Named Executive Officer and are covered in more detail in the Termination and Change of Control table and accompanying discussion. Employment Agreements . The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of the Named Executive Officers. In accordance with his employment agreement, Mr. Srinivasan will serve as CEO and President for a three-year initial term beginning on January 1, 2020. The term of employment will automatically extend for successive periods of one year unless either the Company or Mr. Srinivasan provides written notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the end of the then-current employment term. If the employment agreement is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Srinivasan for good reason, then subject to his execution of a release of claims, Mr. Srinivasan will be entitled to receive severance equal to two years’ then-current base salary and two times the value of his target annual bonus performance shares, which will be paid during regular pay intervals over the course of two years. In addition, he will also receive (a) a lump sum payment in cash, on the 60th day after the termination date, equal to the total after-tax premiums required to pay for 24 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s medical, dental and vision insurance plans; (b) a lump sum payment in cash of his pro-rated bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance with no negative discretion by the Board; and (c) twelve (12) months of accelerated vesting of all equity compensation awards that are subject to time or service-based vesting and were unvested and outstanding on the termination date. However, if notice of non-renewal is given within the last 12 months of the initial three-year employment term severance will only be paid for a 12-month period. If such termination occurs within three months before or 24 months after a change in control, Mr. Srinivasan will receive two times the sum of his then-current base salary and target annual bonus, two times the COBRA payment and 100% release of any post-closing restrictions related to equity awards that were deemed vested as a result of the change of control. In addition, upon any termination of employment, Mr. Srinivasan will receive accrued but unpaid base salary and payment for any unused vacation and unreimbursed expenses. The Company entered into employment agreements with each of the other Named Executive Officers on July 27, 2020, other than Mr. Pritchett, whose employment with the Company had terminated prior to this date. Under the employment agreements for these Named Executive Officers, upon termination without cause, we must pay severance equal to 12 months’ salary and reimbursement of the executive’s total premium for 12 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s health benefit plans. If the executive’s compensation is reduced by more than 10%, other than a general reduction that affects all similarly situated executives, or if at any time prior to a change in control the executive no longer reports to the CEO, the executive may terminate his employment if the Company fails to materially cure such condition within 30 days following notice of such condition by the executive, and the termination will be deemed to be a termination without cause and the executive is entitled to his or her severance benefits. In the event that any of these Named Executive Officers are terminated without cause or by the executive for good reason in the 24 months following a change of control of the Company, the executive is entitled to severance pay equal to 12 months’ salary and a pro rata portion of target annual incentive and reimbursement of the executive’s total premium for 12 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s health benefit. None of the Named Executive Officers is entitled to excise tax gross-up payments. In consideration of the severance benefits, Mr. Srinivasan is subject to 24-month post-termination confidentiality and non-disclosure requirements, as well as non-competition and non-solicitation obligations, except that if the term of his employment agreement expires at the end of the initial three-year term, the non-competition provisions will only apply for 12 months following termination. Each other employment agreement contains a 12-month post-termination non-solicitation provision, an indefinite confidentiality provision, and a 12-month post-termination non-compete provision. Our Compensation Committee believes that the terms of these employment agreements enhance our ability to retain our executives and contain severance costs by providing reasonable severance benefits competitive with market practice. Severance costs are contained by limiting pay to one year in the absence of a change of control, limiting personal benefits, not providing accelerated vesting for awards under the agreements, and narrowly defining a voluntary termination that triggers severance benefits. Severance payments in the event of a change of control are subject to a double trigger such that severance benefits are provided only upon a combination of a change of control and a qualified termination. Additionally, the Company benefits greatly from the non-competition, non-disclosure, and non-solicitation clauses contained in the employment agreements. 15 Accelerated Vesting . Except as described above for our CEO, none of the employment agreements provide for accelerated vesting of equity. Under our 2020 and 2016 Stock Incentive Plans, vesting is accelerated upon the actual occurrence of a change of control for all SSARs and restricted shares (including performance shares). The Compensation Committee believed that during a change of control situation, a stable business environment is in the shareholders’ best interests, and accelerated vesting provisions provide stability. The accelerated vesting provisions are applicable to all employees who receive equity awards, not just executive management. The equity incentive awards granted to the Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2021 are subject to a holding period of one year following a change of control. Under this provision, all unvested SSARs and restricted shares granted for fiscal year 2021 accelerate upon the actual occurrence of a change of control but remain subject to restrictions on exercise and transfer until the earlier of one year after the change of control or the executive’s qualified termination. The Committee believed that this further restriction during a change of control situation further promotes a stable business environment and is in the shareholders’ best interests. CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure The following is a reasonable estimate, prepared under applicable SEC rules, of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees. We determined our median employee in 2020 based on base salary (annualized in the case of full- and part-time employees who joined the company during fiscal year 2020) of each of our employees (excluding the CEO), as of March 31, 2021. The annual total compensation of our median employee (other than the CEO) for 2021 was $33,774. As disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table appearing on page 18, our CEO’s annual total compensation for fiscal year 2021 was $348,447. Based on the foregoing, our estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 10 to 1. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. The pay ratio this year was positively impacted by a significant decline in our CEO’s annual compensation since he voluntarily did not accept a base salary for 9 months of the fiscal year as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the median employee’s salary does not reflect any pandemic related adjustments. Additional Compensation Policies Clawback – Recoupment of Bonuses, Incentives, and Gains. Under the Company’s “clawback” policy, if the board of directors determines that our financial statements are restated due directly or indirectly to fraud, ethical misconduct, intentional misconduct, or a breach of fiduciary duty by one or more executive officers or vice presidents, then the board of directors will have the sole discretion to cancel any stock-based awards granted and to take such action, as permitted by law, as it deems necessary to recover all or a portion of any bonus or incentive compensation paid and recoup any gains realized in respect of equity-based awards, provided recoveries cannot extend back more than three years. Additionally, under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, if we are required to restate our financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements as a result of misconduct, our CEO and CFO must reimburse us for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 12 months following the first public issuance of the non-complying document, and any profits realized from the sale of our securities during those 12 months. Stock Ownership Guidelines . To underscore the importance of strong alignment between the interests of management and shareholders, the board of directors approved stock ownership guidelines for directors and executives, with our CEO and directors having the highest ownership requirements. Director and executive compensation are designed to provide a significant opportunity to tie individual rewards to long-term Company performance. The objective of our stock ownership guidelines is to support this overall philosophy of alignment and to send a positive message to our shareholders, customers, suppliers, and employees of our commitment to shareholder value. Each director and executive officer is expected to maintain minimum share ownership of shares with a value based on a multiple of base salary or director annual retainer listed below: Multiple of Director Annual Retainer and Executive Base Salary 2 Years 4 Years Directors 3x 6x CEO 3x 6x Other Executive Officers 1.5x 3x Stock ownership that is included toward attainment of the guidelines includes (i) shares owned directly (including through open market purchases, through the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan or acquired and held upon vesting of Company equity awards); (ii) shares owned either jointly with, or separately by, his or her immediate family members residing in the same household; (iii) shares held in trust for the benefit of the individual, or his or her immediate family members; and (iv) in-the-money value of vested but unexercised stock options and stock appreciation rights. 16 Directors and executives are expected to attain the specified target ownership levels within both two and four years from the later of the effective date of this policy or becoming a director or an executive and remain at or above that level until retirement. Annually, the Compensation Committee of the board of directors reviews progress toward achieving these ownership levels, and at its meeting in May 20201, the Compensation Committee determined that all of the directors and executives met the prescribed ownership levels. Until a director or executive has satisfied the stock ownership guidelines, such director or executive is required to retain fifty percent (50%) of the net shares of common stock received from the Company as compensation after deducting any shares withheld by the Company or sold by the director or executive, if any, for the purpose of satisfying the exercise price and tax liabilities and related fees related to the settlement event. Once an individual achieves his or her stock ownership goal, these retention restrictions no longer will apply unless a disposition would cause the individual's stock ownership to fall below his or her goal. Impact of Tax Considerations . Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, through December 31, 2017, limited the tax deduction of public companies for compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid to their CEO and the three most highly compensated executive officers (other than the CFO) at the end of any fiscal year unless the compensation qualified as “performance-based compensation” Under applicable IRS regulations. For tax years after December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 amended Section 162(m) to expand the $1.0 million deduction limitation described above to a larger group of employees and to eliminate the “performance-based” exception. The employees (referred to as “covered employees”) to whom the deduction limitation applies include the CEO and CFO (in each case, whether or not serving as executive officers as of the end of the fiscal year) and the three other most highly compensated executive officers. In addition, once considered a “covered employee” for a given year, the individual will be treated as a “covered employee” for all subsequent years. The Compensation Committee has considered the effect of Section 162(m) on the Company’s executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee exercises discretion in setting base salaries, structuring incentive and long-term compensation awards and in determining payments in relation to levels of achievement of performance goals. The Compensation Committee believes that the total compensation program for Named Executive Officers should be managed in accordance with the objectives outlined in the Committee’s compensation philosophy and in the best overall interests of the Company’s shareholders. Accordingly, compensation paid by the Company may not be deductible because such compensation exceeds the limitations for deductibility under Section 162(m). COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with the Company’s management. Based on that review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be incorporated in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, and included in the Company’s Proxy Statement for its 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors Melvin Keating, Chairman Michael A. Kaufman Jerry Jones John Mutch 17 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table and related notes provide information regarding fiscal year 2021 compensation for our Named Executive Officers, including our CEO and CFO, and the other three most highly compensated executive officers whose total compensation exceeded $100,000 for fiscal year 2021.

For Mr. DeMarinis, amounts also include commission and other sales-related incentives. (2) Stock Awards include grants of restricted shares and performance shares. Option Awards include SSAR grants. Amounts disclosed do not represent the economic value received by the Named Executive Officers. The value, if any, recognized upon the exercise of a SSAR will depend upon the market price of the shares on the date the SSAR is exercised. The value, if any, recognized for restricted and performance shares will depend upon the market price of the shares upon vesting. In accordance with SEC rules, the values for restricted and performance shares and SSARs are equal to the aggregate grant date fair value for each award computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The values for restricted and performance shares are based on the closing price on the grant date. For Mr. Srinivasan, $180,000 of the stock award consisted of shares of common stock awarded based on the achievement of performance conditions, and the amount recorded above is based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions on the date of grant. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the amounts recorded for Mr. Srinivasan’s awards were based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions on the date of grant, and in fiscal year 2020 Mr. Srinivasan was actually granted $114,750, and in fiscal year 2019 he was granted $533,340 and $225,000 of the award. For the other Named Executive Officers, the values for SSARs are based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model for time-vesting SSARs and the Lattice option pricing model that utilizes a binomial tree to forecast option pricing for performance SSARs, as described in the CD&A above. Discussion of the assumptions used in determining these valuations is set forth in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company’s 2021 Annual Report. For Stock Awards, the amounts shown represent grants of restricted shares to each Named Executive Officer as part of the executive’s annual long-term equity grant. (3) Amounts represent annual incentive payments received for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 based on pre-set incentive goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year and tied to the Company’s financial, strategic, and operational goals.

Total target, and maximum payouts were conditioned on achievement of goals based on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and end of year cash balance for each Named Executive Officer other than Mr. Srinivasan. As discussed in the CD&A above, for those Named Executive Officers, cash-based annual incentives could be paid at less than threshold payment level provided that threshold performance was achieved. Fiscal year 2021 payouts for each Named Executive 19 Officer pursuant to these awards are shown in the Summary Compensation Table above in the column titled Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. Further explanation of potential and actual payouts by component is set forth in the CD&A. (2) The Compensation Committee of the board of directors made all equity awards to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2021 on June 2, 2020, subject to shareholder approval of the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. Shareholder approval was obtained on November 19, 2021, which is considered the grant date of the equity awards for purposes of the table. (3) Share amounts represent grants of restricted shares to each Named Executive Officer as part of the executive’s annual long-term equity grant. The restricted shares are exercisable in thirds beginning on March 31, 2021. (4) Share amounts represent SSARs granted to each Named Executive Officer as part of the executive’s annual long-term incentive grant. The first of the listed grants for each executive vests twenty percent on March 31, 2021, 20% on March 31, 2022, and 15% on each of June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2023. The second of the listed grants for each executive vests upon the closing price of the Company’s common stock averaging at least $45 per share for ten consecutive trading days, regardless of the price performance thereafter. All SSARs have a seven-year term. (5) The dollar amount shown for each equity grant represents the grant date fair value of the SSARs and restricted shares, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The actual value, if any, recognized upon the exercise of a SSAR or vesting of restricted shares will depend upon the market price of the shares on the date the SSAR is exercised or restricted shares vest.

Termination and Change of Control The following table and discussion summarize certain information related to the total potential payments which would have been made to the Named Executive Officers in the event of termination of their employment with the Company, including in the event of a change of control, effective March 31, 2021, the last business day of fiscal year 2021, assuming that the current employment agreements with each of our Named Executive Officers had been in effect at such time. Mr. Pritchett resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective June 1, 2020, and resigned as an employee of the Company effective June 30, 2020. On July 2, 2020, the Company and Mr. Pritchett entered into a post-employment restrictive covenants agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid Mr. Pritchett a lump sum cash payment of $44,200, and Mr. Pritchett agreed for a period of one year after June 30, 2020, not to hire or retain, or have any other person or firm hire or retain, any of the Company’s employees, and not to contribute his knowledge, directly or indirectly, as an employee, owner, director, officer or other similar capacities to any entity engaged in the same or similar business as the Company. Mr. Pritchett also agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the Company’s confidential information. Employment Agreements. The Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Pritchett are each a party to an employment agreement with the Company. If Mr. Srinivasan’s employment agreement is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Srinivasan for good reason, then subject to his execution of a release of claims, Mr. Srinivasan will be entitled to receive severance equal to two years’ then-current base salary and two times the value of his target annual bonus performance shares, which will be paid during regular pay intervals over the course of two years. In addition, he will also receive (a) a lump sum payment in cash, on the 60th day after the termination date, equal to the total after-tax premiums required to pay for 24 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s medical, dental and vision insurance plans; (b) a lump sum payment in cash of his pro-rated bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance with no negative discretion by the Board; and (c) twelve (12) months of accelerated vesting of all equity compensation awards that are subject to time or service-based vesting and were unvested and outstanding on the termination date. However, if notice of non-renewal is given within the last 12 months of the initial three-year employment term severance will only be paid for a 12-month period. If such termination occurs within three months before or 24 months after a change in control, Mr. Srinivasan will receive two times the sum of his then-current base salary and target annual bonus, two times the COBRA payment and 100% release of any post-closing restrictions related to equity awards that were deemed vested as a result of the change of control. In addition, upon any termination of employment, Mr. Srinivasan will receive accrued but unpaid base salary and payment for any unused vacation and unreimbursed expenses. For Mr. Srinivasan, good reason means (i) a reduction in his base salary or target bonus opportunity, (ii) a material diminution in his authority, duties or responsibilities (including, without limitation, his no longer being the CEO of a publicly-traded company or the requirement that he report to anyone other than the Company’s board of directors or following a change in control he is not made the 21 chief executive officer of the ultimate parent of the resulting entity), (iii) his removal as a member of the board of directors (other than by his voluntary resignation), (iv) any other action that constitutes a willful and material breach by the Company of a material provision of his employment agreement, (v) a material reduction in the benefits provided to him that is not part of a broader reduction of benefits applicable to substantially all other officers of the Company, or (vi) a material breach of the agreement by the Company (including a failure to pay current compensation or benefits when due), and the Company fails to materially cure such condition within 30 days of notice of the breach. For the other Named Executive Officers, good reason is limited to where the Company changes the Named Executive Officer’s position such that his compensation or responsibilities are substantially lessened, and the Company fails to cure such situation within 30 days after notice. If the Company terminates the employment of any of the other Named Executive Officers without cause, we must pay severance equal to 12 month’s salary and reimbursement of the executive’s total premium for 12 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s health benefit plans. If the executive’s compensation is reduced by more than 10%, other than a general reduction that affects all similarly situated executives, or if at any time prior to a change in control the executive no longer reports to the CEO, the executive may terminate his employment if the Company fails to materially cure such condition within 30 days following notice of such condition by the executive, and the termination will be deemed to be a termination without cause and the executive is entitled to his or her severance benefits. In the event that any of these Named Executive Officers are terminated without cause or by the executive for good reason in the 24 months following a change of control of the Company, the executive is entitled to severance pay equal to 12 months’ salary and a pro rata portion of target annual incentive and reimbursement of the executive’s total premium for 12 months’ of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s health benefit. During the term of his employment and for 24 months thereafter, Mr. Srinivasan is subject to the Company’s standard confidentiality and non-disclosure requirements, as well as non-competition and non-solicitation obligations, except that if the term of the employment agreement expires at the end of the initial three-year term, the non-competition provisions will only apply for 12 months following termination. Following a termination of employment of any other Named Executive Officer for any reason, such Named Executive Officer is prohibited for a 12 month period following termination from being employed by, owning, operating, controlling, or being connected with certain businesses that compete with the Company. Each other Named Executive Officer’s agreement also contains an indefinite non-disclosure provision for the protection of the Company’s confidential information and a 12 month non-solicitation of Company employees.

(2) For Mr. Srinivasan, “cause” is defined as (i) conviction of a crime involving misappropriation of money or other property or conviction of a felony, or a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere with respect to a felony, (ii) conduct that is Prohibited Activity under the non-competition section of his employment agreement, (iii) conduct that breaches his duty of loyalty to the Company or his willful misconduct, any of which materially injures the Company, (iv) a willful and material breach of his material obligations under any agreement entered into between him and the Company that materially injures the Company, or (v) failure to substantially 22 perform his reasonable duties with the Company (other than by reason of his disability) that materially injures the Company. For the other Named Executive Officers, “cause” is defined as ( i ) breach of employment agreement or any other duty to the Company, (ii) dishonesty, fraud, or failure to abide by the published ethical standards, conflicts of interest, or material breach of Company policy, (iii) conviction of a felony crime or crime involving misappropriation of money or other Company property, or (iv) misconduct, malfeasance, or insubordination. For Mr. Srinivasan, good reason means ( i ) a reduction in base salary or target bonus opportunity, (ii) a material diminution in authority, duties or responsibilities (including, without limitation, no longer being the CEO of a publicly-traded company or the requirement that he report to anyone other than the Company’s Board of Directors or following a Change in Control he is not made the chief executive officer of the ultimate parent of the resulting entity), (iii) removal as a member of the Board (other than by voluntary resignation), or failure to be appointed to the board of directors of the ultimate parent of any resulting entity following a change in control, (iv) any other action that constitutes a willful and material breach by Agilysys of a material provision of his employment agreement, (v) a material reduction in the benefits provided to him that is not part of a broader reduction of benefits applicable to substantially all other officers of the Company, or (vii) a material breach of his employment agreement by Agilysys, including the failure to pay his current compensation or benefits when due. For the other Named Executive Officers, good reason means ( i ) a reduction in base salary or target bonus eligibility by more than 10% from its then current level, other than a general reduction in base salary or target bonus eligibility that affects all similarly situated executives in substantially the same proportions, or (ii) at any time prior to a change in control of the Company, the Named Executive Officer no longer reports to the CEO, and the Company fails to cure any such situation within 30 days after notice. (3) Health Insurance consists of health care and dental care benefits. The amount reflects reimbursement of COBRA benefits for the applicable period. (4) Severance payments in the event of a change of control are subject to a double trigger such that severance benefits are provided only upon a combination of a change of control and a qualified termination. SSARs and restricted shares vest upon a change of control. For SSARs the value of accelerated vesting is calculated using the closing price of $47.96 per share on March 31, 2021, less the exercise price per share for the total number of SSARs accelerated. The value of restricted shares upon vesting reflects that same $47.96 closing price. Values represent potential vesting under a hypothetical change of control situation on March 31, 2021. (5) All SSARs vest upon death or disability. 23 Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters.

The board of directors adopted Related Person Transaction Procedures to formalize the procedures by which our Audit Committee reviews and approves or ratifies related person transactions. The procedures set forth the scope of transactions covered, the process for reporting such transactions, and the review process. Covered transactions include any transaction, arrangement, or relationship with the Company in which any director, executive officer, or other related person has a direct or indirect material interest, except for business travel and expense payments, share ownership, and executive compensation approved by the board of directors. Transactions are reportable to the Company’s General Counsel, who will oversee the initial review of the reported transaction and notify the Audit Committee of transactions within the scope of the procedures, and the Audit Committee will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction. Through our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, we make a formal yearly inquiry of all of our executive officers and directors for purposes of disclosure of related person transactions, and any such newly revealed related person transactions are conveyed to the Audit Committee. All officers and directors are charged with updating this information with our internal legal counsel. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE NASDAQ listing standards provide that at least a majority of the members of the board of directors must be independent, meaning free of any material relationship with the Company, other than his or her relationship as a director. The Guidelines state that the board of directors should consist of a substantial majority of independent directors. A director is not independent if he or she fails to satisfy the standards for director independence under NASDAQ listing standards, the rules of the SEC, and any other applicable laws, rules, and regulations. During the board of directors’ annual review of director independence, the board of directors considers transactions, relationships, and arrangements, if any, between each director or a director’s immediate family members and the Company or its management. In May 2021, the board of directors performed its annual director independence review and, as a result, determined that each of Donald Colvin, Dana Jones, Jerry Jones, Michael A. Kaufman, Melvin Keating, and John Mutch qualify as independent directors. Ramesh Srinivasan is not independent because of his service as President and CEO of the Company. 26 Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. The Audit Committee reviewed the fees of Grant Thornton LLP, our Independent Accountant for fiscal year 2021. Fees for services rendered by Grant Thornton for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were: Fiscal Year Audit Fees ($) Audit-Related Fees ($) Tax Fees ($) All Other Fees ($) 2021 667,383 — — — 2020 660,565 10,993 2,561 — “Audit Fees” consist of fees billed for professional services provided for the annual audit of our financial statements, annual audit of internal control over financial reporting, review of the interim financial statements included in quarterly reports, and services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. “Audit- Related Fees” relate to professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements. “Tax Fees” include tax compliance and tax consulting services. “All Other Fees” relate to professional services not included in the foregoing categories, including services related to other regulatory reporting requirements. The Audit Committee adopted an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy to ensure compliance with SEC and other rules and regulations relating to auditor independence, with the goal of safeguarding the continued independence of our Independent Accountant. The Pre-Approval Policy sets forth the procedures and conditions pursuant to which audit, review, and attest services and non-audit services to be provided to the Company by our Independent Accountant may be pre-approved. The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non- audit services performed by our Independent Accountant to assure that the provision of such services does not impair independence. Unless a type of service to be provided has received pre-approval as set forth in the Pre-Approval Policy, it will require separate pre-approval by the Audit Committee before commencement of the engagement. Any proposed service that has received pre-approval but which will exceed pre-approved cost limits will require separate pre-approval by the Audit Committee. All audit, non-audit, and tax services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee during fiscal years 2021 and 2020. 27 PART IV Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.

Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions.

Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, our ability to manage the direct and indirect impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on our business, operations, and customer demand for our products and services, our ability to achieve operational efficiencies and meet customer demand for products and services as well as the other risks identified in the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report.

Business. Overview Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative guest-centric cloud-native and on-premises technology solutions for casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive solutions in the industry, including point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payment solutions, and related hospitality applications, to manage the entire guest journey. Agilysys is known for its leadership in hospitality, its broad product offerings and its customer-centric service. Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Windward Concourse, Suite 250, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30005. Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2021 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. History and Significant Events Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc. In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries. In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. In fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining operating units. In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market. In fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts. Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy, integrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship. Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from subscription services, cloud applications, ongoing support and maintenance agreements, and professional services. 4 Products, Support and Professional Services We are a leading developer and marketer of software enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software solutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; support, maintenance and subscription services; and, professional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core solutions. We present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories: • Products (hardware and software) • Support, maintenance and subscription services • Professional services Total revenue for these three specific areas is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Products $ 26,714 $ 44,230 $ 39,003 Support, maintenance and subscription services 88,565 83,680 75,496 Professional services 21,897 32,847 26,343 Total $ 137,176 $ 160,757 $ 140,842 Products: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems. Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions’ ability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases. Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting end to end solutions while market demand for innovative new products addressing specific hospitality needs continues to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud. Professional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive experience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money. Our portfolio of hospitality software solutions: The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated “platform-centric” solutions for Lodging and Food & Beverage functions, including the applications necessary to support this ecosystem. Our technology platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests before, during and post-visit. We offer an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve the guest experience, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our integrated yet modular products allow hospitality operators to recruit and retain customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest and improve the overall experience throughout the entire guest journey – from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions. 5 With our o mni- c hannel suite of software products, we are uniquely positioned to offer solutions that allow customers to adhere to social distancing guidelines , offer contactless solutions at every point of the guest journey , and maximize operational efficiency all while providing an improved guest experience. Point of Sale (POS) Solutions: Agilysys POS solution suite allows customers to provide their guests with an omni-channel experience within their property. Guests are empowered to create their own experiences through ordering from a mobile device or walking up to a self-service kiosk, but also providing for a more traditional experience with staff by interacting with a cashier or bar, or having a server come to them. Irrespective of the channel of interaction for the guest, our POS suite provides a single integrated enterprise grade back office management system with robust reporting capabilities. This allows our customers to manage menus, price changes, purchasing trends, inventory management and sales reporting from a single integrated source providing for increased efficiency as well as providing a richer guest profile. Agilysys InfoGenesis® POS is an award-winning point of sale solution that combines a fast, intuitive and highly customizable terminal application with powerful, flexible reporting and configuration capabilities in the back office management portal. The system is easy to set up, and its scalable architecture enables customers to add workstations without having to build out expensive infrastructure. The system’s detailed and high-quality reporting capabilities provide insight into sales data and guest purchasing trends. Engineered for all regions of the world, the InfoGensis POS solution suite offers a multinational set of features, including language, currency and fiscal technology, coupled with a robust enterprise management capability enabling the largest global customers to run their business efficiently.

Virtual Check-in and Check-out Solutions Today’s hotels cater to guests with high expectations when it comes to technological efficiency.

Casino Vail Resorts Comanche Nation of Oklahoma MGM Valley View Casino & Hotel Costa Pacifica Oxford Casino Vanderbilt University The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas Palm Garden Hotel Wendover Resorts Crystal Springs Resort Industry and Markets We are a technology software solutions company exclusively focused on the hospitality industry. Our products have been enabling mission-critical core hospitality operations for more than four decades. Our software solutions are required to run the operations of the hospitality business and designed to drive substantial customer benefits through increased revenue, improved operational efficiency, enhanced guest experience and improved employee morale. In addition, many of our solutions enable social distancing capabilities for our customers. Our innovative software solutions described above have been purpose-built to serve the unique needs of the following hospitality sectors: casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. We operate across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. The sectors we serve are going through unprecedented and uncertain times with the COVID-19 pandemic. As more people receive vaccinations and pandemic-related restrictions begin to ease, we are seeing the initial signs of recovery and re-opening in the markets we serve. Therefore, the long-term outlook remains strong and we expect the momentum from the three years preceding the pandemic to eventually pick back up with a focus on social distancing and mobile applications. Prior to COVID-19, we estimated our total addressable market to be approximately $4.8 billion in annual recurring revenue opportunity. While the size of the opportunity might face pressure in an economic downturn, we feel it is still in the billions of dollars and we are only a fraction of that size. We continue to feel good about our opportunity to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the industry. 11 Customers Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly fragmented. Human Capital As of March 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,350 employees, with approximately 68%, 28%, 3%, and 1% of our employees located in India, the United States, APAC, and EMEA, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success. Our senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses in hospitality. We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their growth and development. We offer our employees pay and benefits packages that we believe are competitive with others throughout our industry, as well as within the local markets in which we operate, and align individual performance with our success. We encourage our employees to embrace different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds. We are committed to providing our employees with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We make all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws. All employees, directors, independent contractors, and other parties who work with Agilysys are expected to create a working environment where everyone is respected, regardless of individual differences. Valuing each person’s character, virtues, and individual experiences will leverage our ability to attract and retain quality employees, customers, and suppliers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These changes include having most of our employees work from home until the pandemic eases while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work at our customers’ locations. We have taken, and will continue to take, actions in accordance with the applicable local guidance, such as the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, to protect our employees so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. Seasonality Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results. Competition Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., Shiji, Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies like POSitouch, Northwind and Appetize Technologies. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains. Environmental Matters We believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations.

Risks Relating to Our Business COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time. The global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 has resulted in disruption to our business, the hospitality industry and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led government and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, gatherings of large numbers of people, and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. Even as these restrictions have been relaxed in some parts of the world, such as many areas of the United States, they remain effective in other parts of the world and have frequently been reimposed in many locations after having been relaxed as a result of additional outbreaks. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced demand for gaming, hotels, resorts, cruises, corporate foodservice, restaurants, university cafeterias, and stadia and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across these hospitality industries that we serve, and in some cases, has caused the closure of our customers’ businesses. Business closures have resulted in our inability to complete certain implementations and negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to adversely impact our business, operations, and financial results significantly depends on the effect upon the demand for our customers’ hospitality services, which may be affected by, among other things, the duration and scope of COVID-19 (including whether and to what extent a resurgence of the virus could occur after the pandemic initially subsides); the negative impact it has on global regional economies and economic activity, including its impact on unemployment rates and consumer confidence and discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demand for hospitality businesses; the ability of our customers to successfully navigate the impacts of COVID-19; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies, travel activity, businesses, universities and demand for lodging, destination resorts, cruises and stadia events recovers after the pandemic subsides. To the extent that our hospitality customers’ businesses continue to be impacted, it may have the following effects on our business: • Effect on Revenue and Liquidity: If our hospitality customers suffer delayed recovery in their revenues, they could be unable to continue to pay for our services, and potentially even go out of business. If our customers are unable or unwilling to continue to pay for our services on a timely basis or at all, our revenue and liquidity would be adversely affected. • Effect on Growth: As a result of the material sustained reduction in our hospitality customers’ revenue, our customers and prospective customers have substantially curtailed new technology purchases. Customers may also have difficulty obtaining new financing or drawing on existing credit facilities, resulting in them having diminished capital to spend on new technology purchases. Finally, customers or prospective customers may delay, terminate or not go forward with projects in development, for which we may have sold or software. In response to COVID-19, we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency, including furloughing approximately 24% of our employees in the United States, APAC and EMEA during the year. As of May 17, 2021, less than 10 employees remain on furlough. However, the steps we took, and further changes we may make in the future to control our costs, may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees. If this were to occur, we may experience operational challenges that result in a negative impact on our customer services and ultimately, loss of market share, which could limit our ability to grow and expand our business. 13 O ur business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions . We conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including in areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), geopolitical conditions (such as political unrest and armed conflicts), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously purchased products and services. For example, our business is impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in energy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in air travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. As discussed above under “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time,” our performance has been affected by these conditions associated with COVID-19 and could be further materially affected going forward if these conditions continue for an additional extended period or in other circumstances that we are unable to foresee or mitigate. Even after COVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities. Similarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which may adversely affect demand for our customers’ restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity. Our business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes. We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the supply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with international supply. For example, in recent years the United States has imposed and extended greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs, including on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply costs, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance. Our business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer’s needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. The development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including: • Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements; • Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers; and • Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products, such as mobile devices. Our product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will, if ever, receive significant revenues from these investments. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. If we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal liability. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high quality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers’ performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions, 14 breaches or other quality issues , we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure , service disruptions or breaches adversely impact our customers ’ businesses. In addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses. While our contracts typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for errors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability. We face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services. Several companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future. We compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or services, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity. Cyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data against cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in the design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers. The number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including sophisticated “supply-chain” attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks, anticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained therein, our customers and ultimately, our business. These events, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations. We are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. A failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security such as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or 15 potential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers . Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities. Our software may be used in connection with processing personal data and other sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the customer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our development and implementation processes, we cannot assure that our customers’ systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access to our software can be prevented. If a customer, or any other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach of our software, our business could be adversely affected. We have incurred losses in each of the last several years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future. We have incurred operating losses in each of the last several years, including the year ended March 31, 2021, and we may continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to invest in our products. Our lack of profitability limits the resources available to us to invest in developing new products, product upgrades and services and otherwise in improving business operations. We may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results. As of March 31, 2021, we had $19.6 million and $8.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets (including capitalized software development costs), net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis. As of March 31, 2020, we determined the net realizable value of intangible assets consisting of capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in significantly lower sales and cash flow projections for the related rGuest solutions after evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software. As a result, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future. If we fail to attract, retain and motivate key employees, our business may be harmed. Our success depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, retain and motivate the personnel that we need. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate sufficiently experienced and capable personnel, especially in product development, customer services and support, operations, sales and management, our business and financial results may suffer. For example, if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled technical personnel, our ability to develop high quality products and provide high quality customer service may be impaired. Experienced and capable personnel in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. Although we believe our compensation, benefits and other employment amenities are competitive in the markets in which we compete for talent, we may have difficulty attracting sufficiently experienced and capable personnel or retaining and motivating talented employees, and in such events our business may suffer. Additionally, in response to COVID-19, we furloughed approximately 24% of our employees in the United States, APAC and EMEA to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. If this action negatively impacts our ability to attract employees or if employees we desire to return to work do not resume their employment at the end of the furlough, we may experience operational challenges that result in a negative impact on our customer services and ultimately, loss of market share, which could limit our ability to grow and expand our business. See “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time” above for additional information regarding this risk. Our international operations have many associated risks. We continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and challenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. We have international offices in the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and India. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support channels in key 16 international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. I nternational sales are subject to many risks and difficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and managing foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing integrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs , enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; currency fluctuations; and political and economic instability abroad . Natural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research and development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our administrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is concentrated in our India research and development center. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our employees throughout the world have been capable of working from home for months at a time without significantly impacting our business. However, a natural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location that prevents or substantially impairs our employees’ ability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers. We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. This lawsuit remains pending. If we fail to maintain our data centers and other systems, the demand for our subscription services and our ability to operate our business efficiently could diminish, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We currently utilize data center hosting facilities, some of which are managed by third-parties, to provide cloud-based products and hosting services to our customers and to support our internal business operations. If these data center facilities fail or encounter any damage, it could result in interruptions in services to our customers or disruption of our business operations. This could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers, and in turn, our reputation and business could be adversely affected. Similarly, any significant disruption or deficiency in the operation of our internal systems could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. 17 We have encountered risks associated with maintaining large cash balances. While we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts, if any. If we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits. As part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Some of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to litigation, which may be costly. As a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such litigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact on our business. Our dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them. We rely on a concentrated number of vendors for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs. We do not have long term agreements with many of these vendors. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services needs from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner programs, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it may have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins. Risks Relating to the Industries We Serve Our business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Because our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business is largely dependent on the health of that industry. Our sales are dependent in large part on the health of the hospitality industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality industry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, as discussed above, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. For additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, see “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time” above for additional information. Consolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business. Customers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry. Although recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance that future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider’s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services from us, which could have an adverse effect our business. 18 Insolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business. Customers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Most of our customers have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our customers to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property. Customers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Our Stock Our stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. Our stock price has been volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended March 31, 2021, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a high close of $62.91 to a low close of $14.13. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: • uncertainties the COVID-19 pandemic has caused for the global economy; • economic news or other events generally causing volatility in the trading markets; • our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of securities analysts to publish reports about us or our business; • announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; • our ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis; • any major change in our board or management; general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism. On May 22, 2020, we sold $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $20.1676 per share. Until converted, the preferred stock may impede stock price increases above the conversion price. Additionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the volatility of our common share price over time. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our corporate headquarters are located in Alpharetta, Georgia where we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space. In addition, we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, 30,000 square feet of office space in Bellevue, Washington, of which we sublease 22,000 square feet to a third party, 12,000 square feet of office space in Santa Barbara, California, and 6,000 square feet of warehouse space in Roswell, Georgia. Internationally, we lease approximately 102,000 square feet of office space in Chennai, India and lease several other smaller office locations throughout Europe and Asia. Our major leases contain renewal options for periods of up to 10 years. We believe that our current facilities and office space are sufficient to meet our needs and do not anticipate any difficulty securing additional space as needed. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of any current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid, and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 19 2020. Subsequently, Ameranth filed further pleading amendments and discovery requests with the District Court, which were opposed by the defendants. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or writ of certiorari may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys’ fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the remaining claims in the lawsuit, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 20 Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Market Information Our common shares, without par value, are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “AGYS”. As of May 14, 2021, there were 1,505 registered holders of our common shares, without par value. Dividends We did not pay dividends in fiscal 2021 or 2020 on our common stock and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. We pay preferred stock dividends as described in Note 14, Preferred Stock , to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report. The current policy of the Board of Directors is to retain any available earnings for use in the operations of our business. Shareholder Return Performance Presentation The following chart compares the value of $100 invested in our common shares, including reinvestment of dividends, with a similar investment in the Russell 2000 Index (the “Russell 2000”) and with the companies listed in the SIC Code 7373-Computer Integrated Systems Design for the period March 31, 2016 through March 31, 2021. The stock price performance in this graph is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of our common shares. 21 Comparison of 5 Year Cumulative Total Return INDEXED RETURNS Fiscal Years Ended March 31, Base Period Company Name / Index 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Agilysys, Inc. $ 100.00 $ 92.56 $ 116.75 $ 207.35 $ 163.57 $ 469.74 Russell 2000 $ 100.00 $ 126.22 $ 141.10 $ 143.99 $ 109.45 $ 213.26 Peer Group $ 100.00 $ 122.79 $ 141.63 $ 147.27 $ 141.34 $ 187.01 This performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. 22 Item 7. Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report titled, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 3 of this Annual Report and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business during the year ended March 31, 2021. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. We have taken actions to mitigate the impact on our business. We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may continue to delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. The pandemic could have an ongoing adverse impact on demand for our customers’ products and services, which in turn could continue to negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue, and could also negatively impact the ongoing collection of accounts receivable from our customers. During our fiscal 2021, we reduced discretionary costs through actions including hiring freezes on non-essential positions, layoffs, employee furloughs, employee retirement benefit limitations, and salary decreases for executive team members and certain other employees of the Company. While we have eased certain cost reduction measures recently, we may take further actions that alter our business operations as the situation continues to evolve. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive software solutions in the industry, including point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the entire guest journey. Agilysys is known for its leadership in hospitality, its broad product offerings and its customer-centric service. Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia. Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to 23 existing software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: • Putting the customer first • Focusing on product innovation and development • Improving our liquidity • Increasing organizational efficiency and teamwork • Developing our employees and leaders • Growing revenue by improving the breadth and depth of our product set across both point-of-sale and property management applications • Growing revenue through international expansion The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, turning profitable and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue – Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue – We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances. • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. 24 Results of Operations Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020: Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 26,714 $ 44,230 $ (17,516 ) (39.6 )% Support, maintenance and subscription services 88,565 83,680 4,885 5.8 % Professional services 21,897 32,847 (10,950 ) (33.3 )% Total net revenue 137,176 160,757 (23,581 ) (14.7 )% Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 13,506 36,427 (22,921 ) (62.9 )% Support, maintenance and subscription services 17,985 19,248 (1,263 ) (6.6 )% Professional services 16,309 24,130 (7,821 ) (32.4 )% Total cost of goods sold 47,800 79,805 (32,005 ) (40.1 )% Gross profit 89,376 80,952 8,424 10.4 % Gross profit margin 65.2 % 50.4 % Operating expenses: Product development 55,345 41,463 13,882 33.5 % Sales and marketing 14,196 19,864 (5,668 ) (28.5 )% General and administrative 33,273 24,374 8,899 36.5 % Depreciation of fixed assets 2,832 2,574 258 10.0 % Amortization of intangibles 1,959 2,541 (582 ) (22.9 )% Impairments — 23,740 (23,740 ) (100.0 )% Severance and other charges, net 2,529 582 1,947 334.5 % Legal settlements, net 200 (125 ) 325 260.0 % Operating loss $ (20,958 ) $ (34,061 ) $ 13,103 (38.5 )% Operating loss percentage (15.3 )% (21.2 )% 25 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2021 2020 Net revenue: Products 19.5 % 27.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 64.6 52.1 Professional services 15.9 20.4 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold: Products, inclusive of developed technology amortization 9.8 22.6 Support, maintenance and subscription services 13.1 12.0 Professional services 11.9 15.0 Total net cost of goods sold 34.8 49.6 Gross profit 65.2 50.4 Operating expenses: Product development 40.4 25.8 Sales and marketing 10.3 12.4 General and administrative 24.4 15.2 Depreciation of fixed assets 2.1 1.6 Amortization of intangibles 1.4 1.6 Impairments — 14.8 Severance and other charges, net 1.8 0.4 Legal settlements, net 0.1 (0.1 ) Operating loss (15.3 )% (21.2 )% Net revenue. Total revenue decreased $23.6 million, or 14.7%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $17.5 million, or 39.6%, due to delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $4.9 million, or 5.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based revenue, which increased 15.5% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Subscription revenue sales were led by our add on software modules, including modules enabling social distancing and contactless capabilities. Professional services revenue decreased $11.0 million, or 33.3%, due to delays in implementation services due to customer property restrictions, property closures and lower sales from delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $8.4 million, or 10.4%, in fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 50.4% to 65.2%. Products gross profit increased $5.4 million and gross profit margin increased from 17.6% to 49.4% driven mostly by the absence of software development cost amortization during fiscal 2021. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $6.1 million and gross profit margin increased 269 basis points to 79.7% due to increased subscription revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit decreased $3.1 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 26.5% to 25.5% due to the delay in professional service projects and the fixed costs of maintaining a minimum required professional services team as customers continued to work towards re-opening their locations and accept implementations and installations. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, impairments, severance and other charges, increased $16.8 million, or 18.5%, in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have increased 22.0% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $13.9 million, or 33.5%, during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to the continued expansion of our R&D teams and significant share-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs) upon their market condition satisfaction in February 2021. 26 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing de creased $ 5.7 million, or 28.5 %, in fiscal 20 2 1 compared with fiscal 20 20 due to reduced commission expense as a result of lower sales levels, significantly reduced travel, layoffs, temporary reductions in employee benefits, and the absence of in-person trade shows and conference activity . The decrease was slightly offset by an increase in stock-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs . General and administrative. General and administrative increased $9.0 million, or 37.0%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The change is due primarily to significant share-based compensation charges resulting from the accelerated vesting of SSARs. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $0.3 million or 10.0% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to an increased level of assets with shorter useful lives. Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles decreased $0.6 million or 22.9% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to a lower unamortized cost base following the impairment of intangibles in fiscal 2020. Impairments. There were no impairments in fiscal 2021. Impairments totaled $23.7 million in fiscal 2020. The impairments resulted from specific capitalized software development costs supporting certain software applications. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions which made it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the impacted solutions at the time of impairment determination. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. We recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero during the 2020 fiscal year. Severance and other charges. Severance and other charges increased $1.9 million due to an increase in non-restructuring severance activity during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Legal settlements. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters.

Other expense, net consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Year ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Income tax expense (benefit) $ (208 ) $ 201 $ 409 203.5 % Effective tax rate 1.0 % (0.6 )% For fiscal 2021, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets including increases in valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 27 Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. At March 31, 2021, we had $199.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $46.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $ 165.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2022 through 2041. Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019: Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 44,230 $ 39,003 $ 5,227 13.4 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 83,680 75,496 8,184 10.8 % Professional services 32,847 26,343 6,504 24.7 % Total net revenue 160,757 140,842 19,915 14.1 % Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 36,427 31,811 4,616 14.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 19,248 15,895 3,353 21.1 % Professional services 24,130 19,256 4,874 25.3 % Total cost of goods sold 79,805 66,962 12,843 19.2 % Gross profit 80,952 73,880 7,072 9.6 % Gross profit margin 50.4 % 52.5 % Operating expenses: Product development 41,463 37,817 3,646 9.6 % Sales and marketing 19,864 19,646 218 1.1 % General and administrative 24,374 23,118 1,256 5.4 % Depreciation of fixed assets 2,574 2,504 70 2.8 % Amortization of intangibles 2,541 2,567 (26 ) (1.0 )% Impairments 23,740 — 23,740 100.0 % Severance and other charges, net 582 1,168 (586 ) (50.2 )% Legal settlements, net (125 ) 141 (266 ) (188.7 )% Operating loss $ (34,061 ) $ (13,081 ) $ (20,980 ) 160.4 % Operating loss percentage (21.2 )% (9.3 )% 28 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2020 2019 Net revenue: Products 27.5 % 27.7 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 52.1 53.6 Professional services 20.4 18.7 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 22.6 22.6 Support, maintenance and subscription services 12.0 11.3 Professional services 15.0 13.6 Total cost of goods sold 49.6 47.5 Gross profit 50.4 52.5 Operating expenses: Product development 25.8 26.9 Sales and marketing 12.4 13.9 General and administrative 15.2 16.4 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.6 1.8 Amortization of intangibles 1.6 1.8 Impairments 14.8 — Severance and other charges, net 0.4 0.8 Legal settlements, net (0.1 ) 0.1 Operating loss (21.2 )% (9.3 )% Net revenue. Total revenue increased $19.9 million, or 14.1%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Products revenue increased $5.2 million, or 13.4%, due to increased sales in third-party hardware sales including new customers and expansion with existing customers. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $8.2 million, or 10.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 24.3% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Professional services revenue increased $6.5 million, or 24.7%, due to ongoing installations and integration of our software solutions for our growing customer base. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $7.1 million, or 9.6%, in fiscal 2020 and total gross profit margin decreased from 52.5% to 50.4%. Products gross profit increased $0.6 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 18.4% to 17.6% due to a higher mix of third party hardware and software and due to certain allowances established against revenues earned in March 2020 related to products that have been or could be returned from customer locations closed in response to COVID-19 guidelines. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $4.8 million and gross profit margin decreased 195 basis points to 77.0% due to increased costs associated with hosting our customers. Professional services gross profit increased $1.6 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 26.9% to 26.5% after we established allowances against revenues earned in March 2020 due to uncertainties related to COVID-19 conditions. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, impairments and restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $5.2 million, or 6.0%, in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have decreased 4.3% in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $3.6 million, or 9.6%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the reduction of cost capitalization. Certain software applications for which we had capitalized costs reached general availability by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products joined our well-established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. We capitalized $2.0 million of external use software development costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs during fiscal 2019, with the full balance capitalized in Q1 fiscal 2019. We did not capitalize any costs associated with product development during fiscal 2020. Total product development costs, including operating expenses and capitalized amounts, were $41.5 million during fiscal 2020 compared to $40.1 million in fiscal 2019. The $1.4 million increase is mostly due to continued expansion of our R&D teams and infrastructure. 29 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $0.2 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. The change is due primarily to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts due to an increase collection risk of our accounts receivable as of March 31, 2020 as a result of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of our customers, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our annual bonus incentive plan that has declined in value due to a significant decrease in target achievements after reduced fourth quarter revenue activity with concentration in March 2020. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $1.3 million, or 5.4%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The change is due primarily to software investments in third-party applications to host our network and infrastructure. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $0.1 million or 2.8% in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles remained consistent in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Impairments. Impairments totaled $23.7 million in fiscal 2020. There were no impairments in fiscal 2019. The impairments result from specific capitalized software development costs supporting certain software applications. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions which make it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the impacted solutions. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. We have recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges decreased $0.6 million due to a reduction in non-restructuring severance activity during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Legal settlements, net. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters.

We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. At March 31, 2020, we had $199.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $24.7 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had $141.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2021 through 2040. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, payments of preferred stock dividends, and operating expenses including payments of lease obligations. At March 31, 2021, all $99.2 million of our cash on hand was deposited in bank accounts, of which 96% are located in the United States. We believe there is limited credit risk with respect to our cash balances. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations during our entire fiscal 2021, we cannot presently estimate its ongoing financial impact, which will be highly dependent on the severity and duration of the pandemic. As such, due to the ongoing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the indeterminate length of time it will affect the hospitality industry, we have maintained certain proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to be able to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. These measures have included strict cost management actions, such as halting and altering our marketing programs, eliminating non-essential expenses including capital expenditures and reducing payroll and related costs through layoffs and furloughs as well as salary and retirement benefit reductions. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $99.2 million as of March 31, 2021, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements. As of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. Cash Flow Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 28,407 $ 10,575 $ 7,241 Investing activities (1,391 ) (3,447 ) (5,534 ) Financing activities 25,316 (1,116 ) (767 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 195 (130 ) (112 ) Increase in cash $ 52,527 $ 5,882 $ 828 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $28.4 million in fiscal 2021. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $21.0 million adjusted for $44.0 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and an increase of approximately $5.4 million from the changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $10.6 million in fiscal 2020. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $34.1 million adjusted for $46.2 million in non-cash expense including impairment charges, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and a decrease of approximately $1.5 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $7.2 million in fiscal 2019. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $13.2 million adjusted for $22.4 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and an increase of approximately $2 million in net operating assets and liabilities. 31 Cash flow used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 20 2 1 were $ 1 .4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 were $3.4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 were $5.5 million. This is primarily attributed to $2.2 million in capitalized development costs of proprietary software and $3.3 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities. During fiscal 2021, the $25.3 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $7.5 million for the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.1 million in preferred stock dividends. Cash flows used in financing activities of $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in fiscal 2020 and 2019 were primarily comprised of share repurchases to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. Investments Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. We disclose our lease obligations in Note 6, Leases, and preferred stock dividends in Note 14, Preferred Stock, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report. We believe our cash on hand, funds from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to finance capital spending and working capital needs and to service our obligations and other commitments arising during the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies Managements’ Discussion and Analysis is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. 32 For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating the price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and bearing the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. 33 Allowance for e xpected c redit l osses . We maintain allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We base our expected credit loss model on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts . To help mitigate the associated credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. Customer credit allowance . We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount of customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many cases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we invoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested by the customer within the terms of our contract. During fiscal 2021, we have included allowances for various one-time recurring revenue related and other concessions we have given to customers to help them while they deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operational priorities. Share-based compensation. We have a stock incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, time-vested restricted shares, restricted share units, performance-vested restricted shares, and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares. We record compensation expense related to stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and stock-settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. The fair value for stock-settled appreciation rights with a market condition are estimated using a Lattice option pricing model which utilizes a binomial tree to forecast option pricing. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 13, Share-Based Compensation . Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information about recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted and those not yet effective. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We have assets, liabilities, and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk. We sell products and services internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements. For the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue from international operations was 8%, 9% and 9%, respectively of total revenue. The effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the 2021, 2020 and 2019 fiscal years. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies could materially impact our revenue, expenses, operating profit and net income. 34 Item 8. Financial Statemen ts and Supplementary Data.

Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilysys, Inc. (an Ohio corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated May 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, and our report dated May 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Atlanta, Georgia May 21, 2021 37 AGILYSYS, INC.

Nature of Operations Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia, airport foodservice and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive solutions in the industry, including point of sale (POS), property management systems (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the entire guest journey. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within the fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2021 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business during the year ended March 31, 2021. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and suppliers and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Agilysys, Inc. and subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity or cost method, as appropriate. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated. Use of estimates. Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In particular, the economic disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse impact on our results for the year ended March 31, 2021, and we expect it to continue to have a material adverse impact on our results. As such, this annual period, as well as upcoming interim periods, are unlikely to be comparable to past performance or indicative of future performance. Cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity from date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Other highly liquid investments considered cash equivalents with no established maturity date are fully redeemable on demand (without penalty) with settlement of principal and accrued interest on the following business day after instruction to redeem. Such investments are readily convertible to cash with no penalty and can include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, money market funds and other investments. Allowance for expected credit losses. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. We base our expected credit loss model on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. To help mitigate the associated credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. Customer credit allowance . We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount of customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many cases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we invoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested by the customer within the terms of our contract. During fiscal 2021, we have included allowances for various one-time recurring revenue related and other concessions we have given to customers to help them while they deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operational priorities. 43 Inventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of related reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, if necessary, are based upon contractual provisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors, including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. Leases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are presented as Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities – current and operating lease liabilities – non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and corresponding liabilities are included in finance lease obligations – current and non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying asset, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments in exchange for the ability to use the asset for the duration of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and determined using the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing since our leases do not include an implicit interest rate. The estimated incremental borrowing rate considers market data, actual lease economic environment, and actual lease term at commencement date. The lease term may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. ROU assets include lease payments made in advance, and excludes any incentives received or initial direct costs incurred. We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which we account for as a single lease component. We also have leases which include variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred. Our variable lease payments are not based on an index or rate and therefore are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. We have elected to not recognize short term leases that have a term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities. Our short-term leases are not material and do not have a material impact on our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Additionally, we do not have any covenants, residual value guarantees, or related party transactions associated with our lease agreements. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. The carrying amount of goodwill was $ 19.6 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist. The Company evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing its market capitalization based on its closing stock price (Level 1 input) to the book value of its equity on the annual evaluation date. Based on testing performed, the Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill has occurred for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company is also required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least annually, or when current events and circumstances require an interim assessment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Long-lived assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance, repairs, and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under finance leases, which make up less than one percent of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements – 7 to 30 years ; furniture – 7 to 10 years ; equipment – 3 to 10 years ; software – 3 to 10 years ; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the economic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project’s completion. Depreciation for capitalized project expenditures does not begin until the underlying project is completed. We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Our long-lived assets and impairments considerations are discussed further in Note 4, Property and Equipment, Net. Foreign currency translation. The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currencies are not in U.S. dollars are translated at the period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates during the fiscal year. The cumulative translation effects are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an 44 operation are reflected within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency gains and losses from changes in exchange rates have not been material to our consolidated operating results. Revenue recognition. We derive revenue from the sale of products (i.e., software, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. For the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue from international operations was 8 %, 9 % and 9 %, respectively of total revenue. Our customer base is highly fragmented. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain 45 multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Comprehensive (loss) income. Comprehensive (loss) income is the total of net (loss) income, as currently reported under GAAP, plus other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income considers the effects of additional transactions and economic events that are not required to be recorded in determining net (loss) income, but rather are reported as a separate statement of comprehensive (loss) income. Fair value measurements . We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. In determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use various valuation techniques. Investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies. Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with certain former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their respective designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $ 1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives’ designated beneficiary of $ 0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within “Other non-current liabilities.” Additional information regarding the investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is provided in Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans . Income Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 9, Income Taxes . Capitalized Software Development Costs. The capitalization of software development cost for external use begins when a product’s technological feasibility has been established. Capitalization ends when the resulting product is available for general market release. Amortization of the capitalized software is classified within products cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For each capitalized software product, the annual amortization is equal to the greater of: (i) the amount computed using the ratio that the software product’s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or (ii) the amount computed based on straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, which is a range between three and eight years. Annually, or more frequent as required by triggering events, an analysis of the net realizable value of the capitalized software is completed and the amount by which unamortized software costs exceeds the net realizable value, if any, is recognized as a charge to income in the period it is determined. See further discussion regarding our capitalized software development costs in Note 5, Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs. Advertising and Promotion Expense. We expense advertising and promotion expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense was $ 0.4 million, $ 2.7 million and $ 2.0 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively . Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and 46 Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes , and is meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing this standard but do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract . ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. We adopted ASU 2018-15 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. We adopted ASU 2018-13 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 , Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. We adopted ASU 2017-04 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard requires entities to measure expected credit losses for certain financial assets held at the reporting date using a current expected credit loss model, which is based on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company’s financial instruments within the scope of this guidance primarily includes accounts receivable and contract assets. We adopted ASU 2016-13 as of April 1, 2020 under the modified retrospective approach. As a result, comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards applicable for those periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 47 3. Revenue Recognition On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. The cumulative impact of applying the new guidance to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of April 1, 2018 was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the adoption date. As a result of applying the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard, we also impacted accounts receivable, net, contract assets, prepaid expenses and other current assets, other non-current assets, contract liabilities and retained earnings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2018. For in depth discussion regarding our revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 26.7 million, $ 44.2 million, and $ 39.0 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $ 110.5 million, $ 116.5 million, and $ 101.8 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to products and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 40.9 million and $ 37.0 million during fiscal 2021 and 2020. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we transferred from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 2.0 million and $ 2.8 million, respectively, to accounts receivable because the right to the transaction became unconditional. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of March 31, 2021 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. For first year support and maintenance service contracts, commission expenses are immaterial and therefore expenses as incurred. Other sales commission expenses are not material or have a period of benefit of one year or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. 48 W e had $ 2.9 million and $ 3.2 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of March 31, 2021 and 20 20 , respectively . These balances are included in other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet s . During fiscal 202 1 and 20 20 , we expensed $ 2.8 million and $ 4.7 million, respectively, of sales commission s , which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 1.4 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 4. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment at March 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 Furniture and equipment $ 14,899 $ 14,358 Software 16,891 17,136 Leasehold improvements 7,097 7,012 Project expenditures not yet in use 210 50 39,097 38,556 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 30,308 ) ( 24,592 ) Accumulated impairment — ( 1,734 ) Property and equipment, net $ 8,789 $ 12,230 Total depreciation expense on property and equipment was $ 2.8 million, $ 2.6 million, and $ 2.5 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company capitalizes internal-use software, including software used exclusively in providing services or that is only made available to customers as a software service, as property and equipment under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. Total amortization expense on capitalized internal-use software was $ 2.0 million, $ 2.5 million and $ 2.5 million during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered management to review property and equipment held by the Company for indicators of impairment. The carrying value of our capitalized costs for internal-use software related to our rGuest Seat solution did not exceed the estimated undiscounted cash flows, and utilizing a market approach, was determined to be fully impaired, resulting in $ 1.7 million of asset impairment charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Assets under financing leases are included in property and equipment categories above and further disclosed with Note 6. Leases . 5. Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs at March 31, 2021, and 2020: March 31, 2021 and 2020 Gross Net carrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying (In thousands) amount amortization Impairment amount Amortized intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 10,775 $ ( 10,775 ) $ - $ - Non-competition agreements 2,700 ( 2,700 ) — — Developed technology 10,398 ( 10,398 ) — — Trade names 230 ( 230 ) — — Patented technology 80 ( 80 ) — — 24,183 ( 24,183 ) — — Trade names 8,400 N/A — 8,400 Total intangible assets $ 32,583 $ ( 24,183 ) $ - $ 8,400 (In thousands) Software development costs $ 67,541 $ ( 45,535 ) $ ( 22,006 ) $ - Indefinite-lived intangible assets, comprised of our purchased trade name InfoGenesis™ as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 are tested for impairment upon identification of impairment indicators or at least annually. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than fair value. The InfoGenesis™ indefinite-lived purchased trade name impairment testing resulted in a fair value exceeding the carrying amount for the years ending March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Management compares the unamortized capitalized software development costs for each external use product to its net realizable value by analyzing critical inputs such as costs necessary to bring the software to market, costs necessary to maintain the software, life of the software, and market capacity. As of March 31, 2020, management determined the net realizable value of the remaining 49 capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within out rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded the ir carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $ 22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions which make it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the related rGuest solutions . A fter evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software , an impairment charge was required . The amount of impairment recognized during the period reduced the carry ing value of capitalized software development costs to zero with no remaining amortization expense to be recognized in future periods. Amortization expense related to software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $ 12.6 million for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. These charges are included as Products cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 6. Leases The majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of office equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by or associated with our active leases. As of March 31, 2021, we do not have any leases which have not yet commenced. We do not have any related party leases. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable costs are expensed as incurred. We sublease one of our office leases located in Bellevue, Washington with a lease term that will expire during fiscal year 2024. The components of lease expenses, which are included in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, were as follows: Year ended March 31, (in thousands) 2021 2020 Operating leases expense $ 4,440 $ 4,193 Finance lease expense: Amortization of ROU assets 26 23 Interest on lease liabilities 5 6 Total finance lease expense 31 29 Variable lease costs 443 271 Short term lease expense 120 88 Sublease income ( 129 ) — Total lease expense $ 4,905 $ 4,581 Other information related to leases for fiscal 2021 and 2020 was as follows: Year ended March 31, Supplemental cash flow information 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in thousands): Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 5,987 $ 4,873 Operating cash flows for finance leases 30 8 Financing cash flows for finance leases 24 24 ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands): Operating leases $ 1,573 $ 2,734 Finance leases — 17 Weighted average remaining lease terms Operating leases 4.39 5.04 Finance leases 1.44 2.16 Weighted average discount rates Operating leases 10.51 % 10.37 % Finance leases 4.46 % 4.38 % 50 The table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-cancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021: Year ending (in thousands) Operating leases (1) Finance leases 2022 $ 5,211 $ 21 2023 3,494 5 2024 2,859 2 2025 2,144 — 2026 1,584 — Thereafter 2,431 — Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments 17,724 28 Less: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease liabilities ( 4,119 ) ( 3 ) Total lease liabilities $ 13,606 $ 25 (1) Non-cancellable sublease proceeds for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024 of $ 0.7 million, $ 0.8 million, and $ 0.7 million, respectively, are not included in the table above. 7. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Cash (receipts) for interest, net $ ( 87 ) $ ( 371 ) $ ( 329 ) Cash payments for income tax, net 459 694 409 Acquisition of property and equipment under lease obligations — 17 — Accrued capital expenditures 103 187 56 Leasehold improvements acquired under operating lease arrangement — — 62 8.

Income Taxes For the year ended March 31, loss before income taxes consisted of the following: (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Income (loss) before income taxes United States $ ( 26,272 ) $ ( 36,373 ) $ ( 13,621 ) Foreign 5,063 2,507 678 Total loss before income taxes $ ( 21,209 ) $ ( 33,866 ) $ ( 12,943 ) For the year ended March 31, income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following: (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Income tax expense (benefit) Current: Federal $ 9 $ 59 $ 54 State and local 30 21 ( 383 ) Foreign 731 463 514 Deferred: Federal 12 11 79 State and local 32 7 277 Foreign ( 1,022 ) ( 360 ) ( 320 ) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ ( 208 ) $ 201 $ 221 The following table presents the principal components of the difference between the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for the years ended March 31: (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Income tax benefit at the US Federal statutory rate $ ( 4,454 ) $ ( 7,112 ) $ ( 2,718 ) Benefit for state taxes ( 803 ) ( 856 ) ( 304 ) Impact of foreign operations ( 841 ) ( 514 ) ( 310 ) Indefinite life assets 43 19 130 Change in valuation allowance 7,271 8,406 3,302 Change in liability for unrecognized tax benefits 26 22 ( 400 ) Impact of Tax Act, net — — 226 Share-based compensation ( 2,232 ) ( 312 ) 2 Global intangible low-taxed income 985 460 94 Deferred adjustments ( 478 ) — — Provision to return 278 ( 35 ) 53 Other ( 3 ) 123 146 Total income tax expense (benefit) $ ( 208 ) $ 201 $ 221 We have elected to account for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusions in the period in which they are incurred. Our tax provision includes a provision for income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where subsidiaries are profitable, but only a minimal benefit is reflected related to U.S. and certain foreign tax losses due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of future benefits from these losses. The fiscal 2021 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax benefit. The fiscal 2021 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to adjustments to deferred tax assets and the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. 52 The fiscal 2020 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax expense. The fiscal 2020 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, are as follows: (In thousands) 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Accrued liabilities $ 9,141 $ 3,059 Allowance for expected credit losses and doubtful accounts 279 331 Federal losses and credit carryforwards 51,856 47,218 Foreign losses and credit carryforwards 2,103 1,523 State losses and credit carryforwards 11,642 10,911 Deferred revenue 464 582 Property and equipment and software amortization 171 163 Operating lease liabilities 2,694 1,297 Goodwill and other intangible assets 1,889 4,914 Other 90 88 80,329 70,086 Less: valuation allowance ( 74,631 ) ( 66,819 ) Total 5,698 3,267 Deferred tax liabilities: Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 2,312 ) ( 948 ) Goodwill and other intangible assets ( 2,514 ) ( 2,426 ) Other 7 ( 9 ) Total ( 4,819 ) ( 3,383 ) Total deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 879 $ ( 116 ) At March 31, 2021, we had $ 199.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $ 46.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. Our Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore subsidiaries have $ 0.4 million, $ 0.1 million, and $ 0.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore can be carried forward indefinitely. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5 years of operations which includes fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is then subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during the second five years of operations which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. The aggregate value of the benefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $ 1.4 million as of March 31, 2021. The Company has paid minimum alternative taxes during the period of regular tax relief resulting in a credit of $ 1.4 million as of March 31, 2021. At March 31, 2021 we also had $ 165.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2022 through 2041. We recorded valuation allowances related to certain deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2021, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $ 74.6 million was comprised of $ 73.7 million for federal and state deferred tax assets, and $ 0.9 million associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code. Because of our losses in current and prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes. 53 The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $ 8.4 million and $ 6.3 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we will invest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign acquisitions and expansion. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable. We recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions. The aggregate changes in the balance of our uncertain tax positions were as follows for the years ended March 31: (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Balance at April 1 $ 575 $ 580 $ 687 Reductions relating to lapse in statute — ( 5 ) ( 107 ) Balance at March 31 $ 575 $ 575 $ 580 As of March 31, 2021, we had a liability of $ 0.6 million related to uncertain tax positions, the recognition of which would affect our effective income tax rate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. We recognize interest accrued on any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $ 0.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had approximately $ 0.5 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively, of interest and penalties accrued in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the U.S. we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five years. Although we have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open from 2006 forward due to attribute carryforwards. The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2014 forward in certain state jurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years. Years beginning after 2010 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CARES Act. The CARES Act includes provisions addressing the carryback of net operating losses for specific periods, refunds of alternative minimum tax credits, temporary modification to the limitation placed on the tax deductibility of net interest expenses, and technical amendments for qualified improvement property. Additionally, the CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50 % due December 31, 2022; the CARES Act also provides for certain employee retention tax credits. As of March 31, 2021, these provisions are expected to provide us with approximately $ 0.1 million of additional liquidity due to the ability to accelerate outstanding alternative minimum tax credit refunds. Due to the net loss position of the Company, we do not anticipate impacts from net loss carryback or deductibility provisions. We deferred the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through December 31, 2020, but do not anticipate qualifying for employee retention tax credits. As of March 31, 2021, significant uncertainty continues to exist regarding the magnitude and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, we cannot predict at this time the ultimate extent of its impact on our business operations, financial results and resulting effects to income taxes in future periods. See Part II, Item 1A. of this Annual Report for further discussion regarding risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 10. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans We maintain 401(k) plans for employees located in the United States meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, and we match 100 % of the first 1% of the employee's pre-tax contributions and 50 % of the next 5% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. We may also make discretionary contributions each year for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. During fiscal 2021, we suspended matching contributions as part of the 54 cost reduction measures we have taken in response to uncertainties about the impact COVID-19 will have on our results of operations. Agilysys matching contributions were $ 0.1 million, $ 1.8 million, and $ 1.6 million in fiscal 20 2 1 , 20 20 , and 201 9 , respectively. We also maintain defined contribution retirement plans for employees located in the United Kingdom and in the Asia Pacific region in accordance with local statutory requirements and business practices. Defined Benefit Plan We maintain a defined benefit retirement plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees of our India subsidiary in accordance with local statutory requirements and business practices. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The Gratuity Plan is unfunded with obligation amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Employee benefit obligations” within “Other non-current liabilities.” Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agilysys provides certain former executives with life insurance benefits through endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value of $ 1.0 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiaries of $ 0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities."" Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies related to gains and losses incurred on these investments are classified within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a gain of $ 31,000 , $ 14,000 and $ 15,000 in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, related to the corporate-owned life insurance policies. 11. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Contingencies We are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of any current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid, and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. Subsequently, Ameranth filed further pleading amendments and discovery requests with the District Court, which were opposed by the defendants. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or writ of certiorari may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys’ fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the remaining claims in the lawsuit, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 55 12. Loss per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing loss per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Year Ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 Numerator: Net loss $ ( 21,001 ) $ ( 34,067 ) $ ( 13,164 ) Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs ( 1,031 ) — — Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 1,576 ) — — Net loss attributable to common shareholders $ ( 23,608 ) $ ( 34,067 ) $ ( 13,164 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 23,458 23,233 23,037 Loss per share - basic and diluted: $ ( 1.01 ) $ ( 1.47 ) $ ( 0.57 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 4,228 1,510 1,433 Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 132,198 , 208,581 and 300,437 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs"") and unvested restricted shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. In addition, when a net loss is reported, adjusting the denominator of diluted earnings per share would also be anti-dilutive to the loss per share, even if the entity has net income after adjusting for a discontinued operation. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 13. Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. For SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition. Restricted shares and restricted share units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based awards may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted shares and restricted share units have the right to receive dividends, or dividend equivalents in the case of restricted share units, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying awards. 56 We record compensation expense related to SSARs , restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share s is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, which is consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The fair value of SSAR s subject to a service condition is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. The fair value of SSARs subject to a market condition is estimated using a Lattice option pricing model that utilizes a binary tree and includes multiple assumptions including the volatility and life of the award to determine an appropriate fair value based on the award grant date. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Product development 21,634 2,241 1,478 Sales and marketing 4,254 321 469 General and administrative 14,206 2,643 2,429 Total share-based compensation expense 40,093 5,205 4,376 Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled only in common shares of Agilysys. We use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of service condition SSARs. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing service condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: 2021 2020 2019 Risk-free interest rate 0.31 % 1.38%-1.74% 2.68 % Expected life (in years) 4 4.5-5 5 Expected volatility 42.99 % 31.7%-32.42% 32.42 % Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 22.57 $ 10.01 $ 4.72 The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected life of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded vesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date. We use a Lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of market condition SSARs. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing market condition SSARs granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate over contractual term 0.60 % 1.40 % Expected volatility 40.00 % 31.70 % Suboptimal exercise factor 2.50x 3.0x Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 19.55 $ 9.60 57 The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2021 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted- Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 1,644,888 $ 21.07 Granted 2,234,858 20.02 Exercised ( 736,778 ) 18.75 Forfeited ( 72,207 ) 19.80 Cancelled/expired ( 2,508 ) 14.22 Outstanding at March 31, 2021 3,068,253 $ 20.90 5.1 $ 83,038 Exercisable at March 31, 2021 1,913,692 $ 17.74 4.6 $ 57,829 Vested and expected to vest at March 31, 2021 3,068,253 $ 20.90 5.1 $ 83,038 The following table presents additional information related to SSARs activity during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Compensation expense $ 35,808 $ 1,666 $ 943 Total intrinsic value of SSARs exercised $ 25,153 $ 519 $ 907 Total fair value of SSARs vesting $ 31,380 $ 1,328 $ 1,165 As of March 31, 2021, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested service condition SSARs was $ 15.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 2.0 years. A total of 466,471 shares, net of 127,047 shares withheld to cover the employee’s minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury shares to settle SSARs exercised during the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees under the 2020 and 2016 Plans, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 178,462 $ 19.89 Granted 145,210 45.97 Vested ( 159,905 ) 28.72 Forfeited ( 31,569 ) 20.68 Outstanding at March 31, 2021 132,198 $ 37.67 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. During fiscal 2021, a total of 132,444 shares, net of 28,330 shares withheld from the vested restricted shares to cover the employee's minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury. The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares. The following table presents additional information related to restricted stock activity during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019: (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Compensation expense $ 4,285 $ 3,385 $ 2,803 Total fair value of restricted share vesting $ 7,669 $ 4,004 $ 4,383 58 As of March 31, 2021, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $ 4.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.9 years. We do not include restricted stock in the calculation of earnings per share until the shares are vested. Performance Shares The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2021 for performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 30,120 $ 22.41 Granted — — Vested ( 6,714 ) 22.41 Forfeited ( 23,406 ) 22.41 Outstanding at March 31, 2021 — $ — Based on the performance goals, management estimates a liability of $ 180,000 to be settled through the granting of performance shares under the 2020 plan after March 31, 2021. The number of shares granted will be based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date. As of March 31, 2021, total share-based compensation expense related to performance shares has been fully recognized. The following table presents additional information related to performance share activity during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: (In thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Compensation expense $ 180 $ 153 $ 630 Total fair value of performance share vesting $ 115 $ 513 243 Once attainment of the performance goals becomes probable, compensation expense related to performance share awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period based upon the closing market price of our common shares on the grant date. 14. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Accounting Policy We classify convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption clauses that are at the election of the Holders. We increase the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value (described below) for all undeclared dividends using the interest method. The Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights, preferences and restrictions (the Certificate of Amendment included as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 26, 2020, defines all terms not otherwise defined below): Voting The Holders will be entitled to one vote for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock upon all matters presented to the common shareholders of the Company , and except as otherwise provided by the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company or required 59 by law, the Holders and common shareholders will vote together as one class on all matters. Additionally, certain matters specific to the Convertible Preferred Stock will require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. Liquidation Preference Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the “Liquidation Preference”) and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Redemption On and after the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, the Company will have the right, and the Holders will have the right to require the Company, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the then-outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference. Conversion Each Holder will have the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as described in the Certificate of Amendment). Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023 , the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is at least 150 % of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert. Dividends The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. The Holders are not entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis; however, certain anti-dilution adjustments to the Convertible Preferred Stock may be made in the event of such dividends. The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Change in Control Events Upon certain change of control events involving the Company, the Company has the right, and each Holder has the right, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its then-outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for cash consideration equal to (i) 150% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring prior to the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, (ii) 125% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the third anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and (iii) 100% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued. Standstill Restrictions The Purchaser and its affiliates are subject to certain customary standstill provisions that restrict them from, among other actions, acquiring additional securities of the Company if such acquisition would result in the Purchaser beneficially owning in excess of 25 % of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company until the later of the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and the date on which the Purchaser no longer has record or beneficial ownership of common stock and Convertible Preferred Stock that constitute at least 10 % of the outstanding common stock. 60 15.

Change in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Agilysys, under the supervision of the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision of our CEO and CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation, management concluded that Agilysys maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021. Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued their report regarding Agilysys' internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, which is included elsewhere in this annual report. Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our workforce began working remotely in March 2020. Our established internal controls continued to operate as they have historically, and the change in the work environment for our employees did not have a material adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2021.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Corporate Governance Guidelines The Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) adopted by our board of directors are intended to provide a sound framework to assist the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibilities to shareholders. Under the Guidelines, the board of directors exercises its role in overseeing the Company by electing qualified and competent officers and by monitoring the performance of the Company. The Guidelines state that the board of directors and its committees exercise oversight of executive officer compensation and director compensation, succession planning, director nominations, corporate governance, financial accounting and reporting, internal controls, strategic and operational issues, and compliance with laws and regulations. The Guidelines also state the board of directors’ policy regarding eligibility for the board of directors, including director independence and qualifications for director candidates, events that require resignation from the board of directors, service on other public company boards of directors, and stock ownership guidelines. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews the Guidelines and makes recommendations for changes to the board of directors. The Guidelines are available on our website at www.agilysys.com , under Investor Relations. Code of Business Conduct The Code of Business Conduct adopted by our board of directors applies to all directors, officers, and employees of the Company, as well as certain third parties, and incorporates additional ethics standards applicable to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other senior financial officers of the Company, and any person performing a similar function. The Code of Business Conduct is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee, and recommendations for change are submitted to the board of directors for approval. The Code of Business Conduct is available on our website at www.agilysys.com , under Investor Relations. The Company has in place a reporting hotline and website available for use by all employees and third parties, as described in the Code of Business Conduct. Any employee or third-party can anonymously report potential violations of the Code of Business Conduct through the hotline or website, both of which are managed by an independent third party. Reported violations are promptly reported to and investigated by the Company. Reported violations are addressed by the Company and, if related to accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, the Audit Committee. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law or NASDAQ listing standards concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of the Code of Business Conduct. Audit Committee The Audit Committee held eight meetings during fiscal year 2020. The Audit Committee reviews, with our independent registered public accounting firm, the proposed scope of our annual audits and audit results, as well as interim reviews of quarterly reports; reviews the adequacy of internal financial controls; reviews internal audit functions; is directly responsible for the appointment, determination of compensation, retention, and general oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm; reviews related person transactions; oversees the Company’s implementation of its Code of Business Conduct; and reviews any concerns identified by either the internal or external auditors. The board of directors determined that all Audit Committee members are financially literate and independent under NASDAQ listing standards for audit committee members. The board of directors also determined that Ms. Jones and Messrs. Colvin and Mutch each qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” under SEC rules. SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and certain of its executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Company’s common shares to file reports of and changes in ownership with the SEC. Based solely on the Company’s review of copies of SEC filings it has received or filed, the Company believes that each of its directors, executive officers, and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the shares satisfied the Section 16(a) filing requirements during fiscal year 2020, other than: Mr. Badger filed a Form 4 on April 2, 2019 for tax withholding events that included a tax-withholding transaction that was reported 4-1/2 months late; due to the out-of-cycle vesting event having been missed by Company processes, Ms. Jones filed a Form 3 on May 30, 2019, which was 1-1/2 months late; due to delays in completing and filing an application for EDGAR filing codes, Mr. Pritchett filed a Form 4 on May 30, 2019 for an exercise of stock-settled appreciation rights and associated tax withholding that was 7 days late; due to an error by the Company, Mr. Kingsley filed a Form 3 on June 7, 2019, which was 7 days late; and due to delays completing and filing an application for EDGAR filing codes , Mr. Keating filed a Form 4 on March 23, 2020 for the purchase of 1,100 shares that included transactions that were reported 4 and 5 days late, due to Mr. Keating’s email communications with the Company being quarantined by the Company’s email spam filters. 7 Item 11. Executive Compensation. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION None of the members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2020 (Messrs. Jones, Kaufman, Keating, Kolerus (who served until his retirement from the board effective June 30, 2019), and Mutch) is or has been an officer or employee of the Company or has had any relationship with the Company required to be disclosed as a related person transaction, and none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) or board of any company that employed any member of our Compensation Committee or our board of directors during fiscal year 2020. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION During fiscal year 2020, compensation for non-employee directors consisted of the following: • $30,000 annual cash retainer for each non-employee director; • $35,000 annual cash retainer for the chairman of the board; • $15,000 annual cash retainer for the chairman of the Audit Committee; • $12,500 annual cash retainer for the chairman of the Compensation Committee; • $7,500 annual cash retainer for the chairman of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee; • $10,000 annual cash retainer for each member of the Audit, Nominating & Corporate Governance, and Compensation Committees, including each chairman; and • An award of restricted shares to each non-employee director valued at $75,000 on the grant date. We also reimburse our directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred for attendance at board of directors and committee meetings. The fiscal year 2020 equity award for each director consisted of 3,308 restricted shares, based on a $22.67 grant date price, and was granted under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. The restricted shares vested on March 31, 2020, and provided for pro-rata vesting upon retirement prior to March 31, 2020. The grant was made on May 28, 2019, to the then current non-employee directors; however, Mr. Kaufman declined the award given the significant ownership in the Company by his firm, MAK Capital. Our directors are subject to share ownership guidelines that require ownership of either (i) three times the director’s respective annual cash retainer within two years of service and six times the director’s respective annual cash retainer within four years of service; or (ii) 15,000 shares within the first two years following the director’s election to the board of directors and 45,000 shares within four years of election. We pay no additional fees for board of director or committee meeting attendance.

Compensation arrangements with our Named Executive Officers are governed by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors. Our Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2020 consisted of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and our three other most highly compensated officers during fiscal year 2020, as listed below: • Ramesh Srinivasan, President and CEO • Tony Pritchett, our former Vice President and CFO • Kyle Badger, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary • Prabuddha Biswas, Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer • Don DeMarinis, Senior Vice President Sales, Americas Each of the Named Executive Officers were also Named Executive Officers in the prior fiscal year and continued in their positions for fiscal year 2020. Mr. Pritchett resigned as our CFO after the end of fiscal year 2020, effective June 1, 2020. Compensation Focus for Fiscal Year 2020 The compensation arrangements with our Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2020 were similar to the compensation arrangements for Named Executive Officers in recent prior years. Our CEO’s compensation includes base salary and an annual incentive based on company financial performance that is settled in shares of common stock. The compensation for our other Named Executive Officers includes base salary, annual cash incentives based on company financial performance, and long-term equity incentives. After considering the results of our recent votes on Named Executive Officer compensation, which confirmed the Company’s general philosophy and objectives relative to our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee continued to link executive pay to performance and maintained annual incentive opportunities for the Named Executive Officers generally at the same level as fiscal year 2020, while focusing annual incentives on improvements over fiscal year 2019 results. The annual incentive for our CEO, while based on the same company financial measures as the annual incentives for the other Named Executive Officers, was settled in shares of common stock to further align the CEO with shareholder interests and to emphasize long term value creation. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Srinivasan, our CEO. Prior to that, the Company had entered into an employment agreement with him when he joined us as CEO in January 2017. As discussed below under the heading Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation, Mr. Srinivasan’s compensation for fiscal year 2020 was primarily as set forth in his prior employment agreement. In connection with his new employment agreement, and as further discussed below under the heading Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation, the Committee granted Mr. Srinivasan a substantial award of Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights (SSARs) during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. Compensation Philosophy, Objectives, and Structure Our Compensation Committee adopted its pay philosophy, objectives, and structure for Named Executive Officers to achieve financial and business goals and create long-term shareholder value. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives . For fiscal year 2020, as in recent prior fiscal years, our Compensation Committee’s pay philosophy was to emphasize performance-based compensation, tied directly to annual goals or long-term equity awards, and to link compensation to our business strategy. The Compensation Committee’s objective was to establish an overall compensation package to: • Reward the achievement of business objectives approved by our board of directors; • Tie a significant portion of compensation to the long-term performance of our common shares; • Provide a rational, consistent, and competitive executive compensation program that is well understood by those to whom it applies; and • Attract, retain, and motivate executives who can significantly contribute to our success. Compensation Structure . Our compensation structure is comprised of: Base Salary — Base salary provides fixed pay levels aimed to attract and retain executive talent. Variations in salary levels among Named Executive Officers are based on each executive’s roles and responsibilities, experience, functional expertise, relation to peer pay levels, competitive assessments, individual performance, and changes in salaries in the overall general market and for all employees of the Company. Salaries are reviewed annually by our Compensation Committee, and changes in salary are based on these factors and 9 input from our CEO, other than for himself. None of the factors are weighted according to any specific formula. Salaries for new executive officers are generally based on the Compensation Committee’s discretion an d judgment but may be based on any of the above-mentioned relevant factors. Annual Incentives — Annual incentives provide cash variable pay for achievement of the Company’s financial goals, with target incentives set as a percentage of salary, and are designed to reward achievement of goals with an annual cash payment. At the end of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee considers the aggregate compensation of each Named Executive Officer and may adjust the annual incentive payment otherwise earned if the aggregate compensation is deemed deficient or excessive in the opinion and discretion of the Compensation Committee. Annual incentives for our CEO are settled in shares of common stock, instead of cash. Long-Term Incentives — Long-term incentives are variable, equity incentives designed to drive improvements in performance that build wealth and create long-term shareholder value by tying the value of earned incentives to the long-term performance of our common shares. Target long-term incentives are also set as a percentage of salary. Compensation Key Considerations Annual Goal Setting . Annual goals for our Named Executive Officers may be tied to our financial, strategic, and operational goals and may include business specific financial targets relating to our goals. For fiscal year 2020, the Compensation Committee linked annual incentive goals to financial targets emphasizing both growth and profitability. Annual incentives were based on revenue growth, but payment was conditioned upon the achievement of a minimum adjusted EBITDA and a minimum end of year cash balance. Variable Pay at Risk . Our compensation philosophy drives the provision of greater at-risk pay to our Named Executive Officers, and variable pay at risk comprised between 43% and 62% of target annual compensation for the Named Executive Officers. Our Named Executive Officers have significant opportunities for long-term, equity-based incentive compensation, as our philosophy is to tie a significant portion of compensation to the long-term performance of our common shares. Thus, significant emphasis is placed on long-term shareholder value creation, thereby we believe minimizing excessive risk taking by our executives. Compensation Consultants and Competitive Market Assessments . The Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant and did not rely on any market assessment of compensation in setting compensation for fiscal year 2020. The Committee engaged Compensia, Inc. as a compensation consultant and reviewed and considered their market assessment of compensation, along with other factors, in connection with negotiating Mr. Srinivasan’s compensation in his new employment agreement in the fourth quarter of 2020. Following such review and consideration, the Committee determined that Mr. Srinivasan’s compensation for fiscal year 2021 would be as follows: • No change to base salary • Increase in target annual incentive from 75% of base salary to 100% of base salary; and • A grant of 600,000 SSARs at an exercise price of $36.60 per share, which was equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 10, 2020, the date of grant. Of the 600,000 SSARs granted to Mr. Srinivasan, 475,000 SSARs will vest in equal monthly amounts over the next three years, subject to Mr. Srinivasan’s continued employment with the Company. The remaining 125,000 SSARs will vest pro rata daily if the closing price of the Company’s stock has been equal to or higher than $45 per share for 15 business days, regardless of the price performance thereafter, again subject to Mr. Srinivasan’s continued employment on the vesting date. Tally Sheets . Our Compensation Committee analyzed tally sheets at the beginning of the fiscal year to review overall compensation and pay mix for each Named Executive Officer. Tally sheets included a three-year look-back of total compensation, including annual cash compensation, long-term incentive awards granted and earned, and benefits and perquisites. Tally sheets also included a cumulative inventory of equity grants by fiscal year, including the value of outstanding equity at the Company’s then current stock price and the value received for prior vesting and exercises of equity. The tally sheets brought together, in one place, all elements of Named Executive Officers’ actual compensation and information about wealth accumulation so that our Compensation Committee could analyze the individual elements, the mix of compensation and the aggregate total amount of annual and accumulated compensation. Tally sheets were also used by the Committee to evaluate internal pay equity among the Named Executive Officers and to determine the impact of employment termination or change of control events. In support of the philosophy of rewarding performance, tally sheets are used by the Compensation Committee to review compensation as compared to expectations, and our Compensation Committee determined that annual compensation set for our Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2020 was consistent with expectations and with the established compensation philosophy and pay mix guidelines driven by that philosophy. 10 Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation Base Salary . For fiscal year 2020, base salary comprised between 64% and 96% of total target compensation for the Named Executive Officers. Under his prior employment agreement, which was effective for fiscal year 2020, Mr. Srinivasan’s base salary was $600,000 per year, subject to annual review and adjustment by the Compensation Committee. The Committee did not award an increase in base salary for Mr. Srinivasan in fiscal year 2020 because it believed his base salary to still be aligned with the Committee’s philosophy and goals and Mr. Srinivasan believed it would be inappropriate to increase his base salary while the Company continued to be unprofitable. Mr. Srinivasan’s base salary remains $600,000 per year in his new employment agreement. Similarly, the base salaries of the other Named Executive Officers did not change from fiscal year 2019 to 2020. The CEO and Committee believed that their base salaries were still aligned with the Committee’s philosophy and goals and the CEO believed it would be inappropriate to increase their base salaries while the Company continued to be unprofitable. Annual Incentives . Annual Incentive Targets . The Compensation Committee set fiscal year 2020 annual incentive goals at the beginning of the fiscal year. As previously discussed, the Committee linked the annual incentive goals of the Named Executive Officers to revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and cash balance. All the Named Executive Officers were subject to the same annual incentive structure: • 100% of target annual incentives were based on the Company’s achievement of a fiscal year 2020 revenue target of $165 million; • provided that Adjusted EBITDA after payment of annual incentives is not less than $13M; • provided, further, that the Company’s balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal year 2020, was at least $45 million. Component Weighting (%) Threshold Target Maximum Amount Payout (% of target incentive) Amount Payout (% of target incentive) Amount Payout (% of target incentive) Revenue 100% $160M 50 $165M 100 $170M 150 Straight-line achievement would be calculated between the threshold level and the target level and between the target level and the maximum level. No payment was earned at less than target performance, and payouts were capped at 150% of target incentives. If either the Adjusted EBITDA or cash balance conditions were not achieved, then the annual incentives would not be earned. The Committee also allowed for less than 50% achievement if the threshold level of revenue was met, up to the maximum amount on incentive that could be paid while still achieving the Adjusted EBITDA condition. For fiscal year 2020, the Committee believed that revenue growth was most accretive to shareholder value. The Committee imposed the Adjusted EBITDA and cash balance conditions in order to encourage disciplined management of Company expenses and profitable growth . The Committee set the revenue target as a 17% improvement over fiscal year 2019 revenue of $141 million, set the Adjusted EBITA condition as a $2.7 million improvement over fiscal year 2019 Adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million, and set the cash balance condition as a $4.2 million improvement over fiscal year end cash balance of $40.8 million. The Compensation Committee believed that the plan involved performance that was difficult at the target levels and significantly difficult at the maximum level, requiring meaningful improvement over fiscal year 2019 results relative to future expectations at the time the levels were set. Annual Incentive Results . Fiscal year 2020 revenue was $160.6 million, slightly exceeding the $160 million threshold level for annual incentive achievement. This achievement would have qualified the Named Executive Officers for approximately 50% achievement, but payment of annual incentives at that level would have caused the Adjusted EBITDA condition to be missed. The maximum percentage of target incentives that could be paid while still meeting the Adjusted EBITDA condition was 34%. Fiscal year 2020 cash and cash equivalents balance was $46.2 million, above the target cash balance of $45 million. Accordingly, the Committee certified 34% achievement of annual incentive targets. Component Result Target Achievement Revenue $160.6M $165.0M 34% Adjusted EBITDA $13.0M $13.0 Achieved Cash Balance $46.2M $45.0M Achieved 11 CEO Annual Incentive . Mr. Srinivasan was eligible for an annual incentive for fiscal year 2020 based on the Company financial performance metrics described above, with any such earned incentive to be settled in shares of common stock. Pursuant to his prior employment agreement, Mr. Srinivasan’s target annual incentive for fiscal year 2020 was set at 75% of his base salary, or $450,000, with a maximum potential incentive of $900,000 (150% of his base salary and 200% of his target annual incentive), payable upon achievement of 150% of the annual incentive goals, and a threshold potential incentive of $225,000 (50% of his target annual incentive), payable upon achievement of 50% of the annual incentive goals. For fiscal year 2019, at Mr. Srinivasan’s request, the Committee set Mr. Srinivasan’s maximum potential incentive at $675,000, being 150% of his target annual incentive, instead of the 200% provided in his employment agreement. Mr. Srinivasan desired for his maximum potential incentive to be the same as the Company’s other executive officers. Because his annual incentive would be settled in shares of common stock, the Compensation Committee approved a grant of 30,120 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Srinivasan on June 20, 2019, the date that the Committee set his annual incentive goals, which shares were approximately equal in value to his maximum potential incentive on the date of grant. Pursuant to the grant, shares of restricted common stock would vest upon certification by the Compensation Committee of achievement of the annual incentive goals in the amount determined by the Committee, provided that vesting could not occur prior to June 20, 2020, the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, in accordance with the terms of our 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. Based on the fiscal year 2020 results discussed above, Mr. Srinivasan was eligible to earn approximately 34% of this target annual incentive. However, Mr. Srinivasan requested that the Compensation Committee award him the same percentage of his annual incentive target as the lowest amount earned by any other employee of the Company who was on an individual annual bonus plan. Due to individual objectives, employees of the Company on annual bonus plans earned between 25.5 and 34.0% of their annual incentive target for fiscal year 2020. Therefore, Mr. Srinivasan requested that the Committee award him no more than 25.5% of his target annual incentive. The Committee honored the request and determined that Mr. Srinivasan should earn an annual incentive of $114,750 in fiscal year 2020, or 25.5% of his annual incentive target, congruent with the lowest percentage achievement by the Company’s employees. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Srinivasan 6,714 of the original 30,120 shares subject to the annual incentive grant, being the number of shares having a value of $114,750 based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on July 16, 2020, the date that the Committee made its determination. The remaining 23,406 shares subject to the original annual incentive grant were forfeited and can never be earned by Mr. Srinivasan. Annual Incentives for the Other Named Executive Officers . Fiscal year 2020 target annual incentives for the other Named Executive Officers, were set as 50% of the executive’s base salary. Mr. DeMarinis was also eligible for target annual incentives of $125,000 for commissions and other sales-related incentives due to his role as head of our Americas Sales teams. Annual incentives comprised 19% to 25% of total fiscal year 2020 target compensation for these Named Executive Officers.

Based on the fiscal year 2020 results discussed above, each of the Named Executive Officers earned 34% of their target annual incentives subject to the annual incentive plan described above. Mr. DeMarinis earned an additional $111,678 of his target $125,000 sales incentives based on the net gross profit of sales made in the Americas.

As with the annual cash incentives, the Compensation Committee approved fiscal year 2020 long-term incentive (“LTI”) awards for the Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Srinivasan at the beginning of year when the outcome for the fiscal year was substantially uncertain. LTI awards to these Named Executive Officers consisted of stock-settled appreciation rights (“SSARs”) and restricted shares, both with three-year vesting schedules, pursuant to the Company’s sha reholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. Pursuant to his new employment agreement, Mr. Srinivasan received a grant of 600,000 SSARs at an exercise price of $36.60 per share, which was equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 10, 2020, the date of grant. Of those, 475,000 SSARs will vest in equal monthly amounts over the next three years, subject to Mr. Srinivasan’s continued employment with the Company. The remaining 125,000 SSARs will vest if the closing price of the Company’s stock has been equal to or higher than $45 per share for 15 business days, and on the following day, they will vest pro-rata daily over the remainder of the initial three-year term of the new employment agreement regardless of the price performance thereafter, but subject to Mr. Srinivasan’s continued employment on the vesting date. With respect to the other Named Executive Officers, the Committee considered various LTI award alternatives. While annual incentives targeted specific performance goals, the focus on LTI awards was to link compensation directly to shareholder gains. SSARs provided the direct link between compensation and shareholder gains in a less dilutive manner than with stock options, and the three-year vesting schedule also enhanced retention. In addition, restricted shares tie compensation to shareholder gains and highly bolster retention over the vesting period. LTI awards comprised between 23% and 25% of total fiscal year 2020 target compensation for the Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Srinivasan. In setting LTI awards for the Named Executive Officers other than the CEO, the Committee received input and recommendations from our CEO, and at his recommendation set LTI awards for Messrs. Pritchett, Badger and Biswas at 50% of their base salaries, split evenly between shares of restricted common stock and SSARs, the same as in the prior fiscal year. At the recommendation of the CEO, the Committee set Mr. DeMarinis’ LTI Award at 61% of his base salary, split approximately 60% in shares of restricted common stock and approximately 40% in SSARS, because the CEO believed Mr. DeMarinis to be under-equitized in comparison to the other Named Executive Officers. Awards of restricted common stock were based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant ($22.41), and awards of SSARs were based on the Black-Scholes value of our common stock on the date of grant ($7.01).

See the Summary Compensation Table on p. 17 of this Amendment for actual values received. All of these SSARs and restricted shares vest in one-third increments on March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. The SSARs have seven-year terms, are settled in common shares upon exercise, and were granted at an exercise price of $22.41 (the closing price of the common shares on the grant date). Additional Compensation – Executive Benefits . We provide executive benefits to our Named Executive Officers including additional life and long-term disability insurance plans. From time to time, Named Executive Officers also may participate in supplier sponsored events. Executive benefits are further described in the Summary Compensation Table. We believe these benefits enhance the competitiveness of our overall executive compensation package. We have, however, limited executive benefits offered to reduce compensation costs. Additionally, welfare benefits offered to our Named Executive Officers are the same level of benefits offered to all Company employees. Employment Agreements and Change of Control The material termination and change of control provisions of various agreements are summarized below for each Named Executive Officer and are covered in more detail in the Termination and Change of Control table and accompanying discussion. Employment Agreements . The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of the Named Executive Officers. In accordance with his new employment agreement, Mr. Srinivasan will serve as CEO and President for a three-year initial term beginning on January 1, 2020. The term of employment will automatically extend for successive periods of one year unless either the Company or Mr. Srinivasan provides written notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the end of the then-current employment term. 13 If the employ ment agreement is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Srinivasan for good reason, then subject to his execution of a release of claims, Mr. Srinivasan will be entitled to receive severance equal to two years’ then-current base salary and two times the value of his target annual bonus performance shares, which will be paid during regular pay intervals over the course of two years. In addition, he will also receive (a) a lump sum payment in cash, on the 60th day after the termination date, equa l to the total after-tax premiums required to pay for 24 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s medical, dental and vision insurance plans; (b) a lump sum payment in cash of his pro-rated bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance with no negative discretion by the Board; and (c) twelve (12) months of accelerated vesting of all equity compensation awards that are subject to time or service-based vesting and were unvested and outstanding on the termination date. However , if notice of non-renewal is given within the last 12 months of the initial three-year employment term severance will only be paid for a 12-month period. If such termination occurs within three months before or 24 months after a change in control, Mr. Sr inivasan will receive two times the sum of his then-current base salary and target annual bonus, two times the COBRA payment and 100% release of any post-closing restrictions related to equity awards that were deemed vested as a result of the change of con trol. In addition, upon any termination of employment, Mr. Srinivasan will receive accrued but unpaid base salary and payment for any unused vacation and unreimbursed expenses. The Company entered into new employment agreements with each of the other Named Executive Officers on July 27, 2020, other than Mr. Pritchett, whose employment with the Company had terminated prior to this date. Under the employment agreements for these Named Executive Officers, upon termination without cause, we must pay severance equal to 12 months’ salary and reimbursement of the executive’s total premium for 12 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s health benefit plans. If the executive’s compensation is reduced by more than 10%, other than a general reduction that affects all similarly situated executives, or if at any time prior to a change in control the executive no longer reports to the CEO, the executive may terminate his employment if the Company fails to materially cure such condition within 30 days following notice of such condition by the executive, and the termination will be deemed to be a termination without cause and the executive is entitled to his or her severance benefits. In the event that any of these Named Executive Officers are terminated without cause or by the executive for good reason in the 24 months following a change of control of the Company, the executive is entitled to severance pay equal to 12 months’ salary and a pro rata portion of target annual incentive and reimbursement of the executive’s total premium for 12 months’ of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s health benefit. None of the Named Executive Officers is entitled to excise tax gross-up payments. In consideration of the severance benefits, Mr. Srinivasan is subject to 24-month post-termination confidentiality and non-disclosure requirements, as well as non-competition and non-solicitation obligations, except that if the term of his employment agreement expires at the end of the initial three-year term, the non-competition provisions will only apply for 12 months following termination. Each other employment agreement contains a 12-month post-termination non-solicitation provision, an indefinite confidentiality provision, and a 12-month post-termination non-compete provision. Our Compensation Committee believes that the terms of these employment agreements enhance our ability to retain our executives and contain severance costs by providing reasonable severance benefits competitive with market practice. Severance costs are contained by limiting pay to one year in the absence of a change of control, limiting personal benefits, not providing accelerated vesting for awards under the agreements, and narrowly defining a voluntary termination that triggers severance benefits. Severance payments in the event of a change of control are subject to a double trigger such that severance benefits are provided only upon a combination of a change of control and a qualified termination. Additionally, the Company benefits greatly from the non-competition, non-disclosure, and non-solicitation clauses contained in the employment agreements. Accelerated Vesting . Except as described above for our CEO, none of the employment agreements provide for accelerated vesting of equity. Under our 2011 and 2016 Stock Incentive Plans, vesting is accelerated upon the actual occurrence of a change of control for all SSARs and restricted shares (including performance shares). The Compensation Committee believed that during a change of control situation, a stable business environment is in the shareholders’ best interests, and accelerated vesting provisions provide stability. The accelerated vesting provisions are applicable to all employees who receive equity awards, not just executive management. The equity incentive awards granted to the Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2020 are subject to a holding period of one year following a change of control. Under this provision, all SSARs and restricted shares granted for fiscal year 2020 accelerate upon the actual occurrence of a change of control but remain subject to restrictions on exercise and transfer until the earlier of one year after the change of control or the executive’s qualified termination. The Committee believed that this further restriction during a change of control situation further promotes a stable business environment and is in the shareholders’ best interests. 14 CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure The following is a reasonable estimate, prepared under applicable SEC rules, of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees. We determined our median employee based on base salary (annualized in the case of full- and part-time employees who joined the company during fiscal year 2020) of each of our employees (excluding the CEO), as of March 31, 2020. The annual total compensation of our median employee (other than the CEO) for 2020 was $30,784. As disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table appearing on page 17 our CEO’s annual total compensation for fiscal year 2020 was $7,352,134. Based on the foregoing, our estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 239 to 1. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. In addition, the pay ratio this year was impacted by two factors: (1) Significant expansion of our Indian development center, which at the end of fiscal year 2020 contained 53% of our global employees. Market levels of annual total compensation in India are generally substantially less the U.S., where our CEO is based. (2) The substantial SSARs grant to our CEO in connection with his new employment agreement, an event that did not occur in the past two years and is not expected to occur again in the next two fiscal years. Additional Compensation Policies Clawback – Recoupment of Bonuses, Incentives, and Gains. Under the Company’s “clawback” policy, if the board of directors determines that our financial statements are restated due directly or indirectly to fraud, ethical misconduct, intentional misconduct, or a breach of fiduciary duty by one or more executive officers or vice presidents, then the board of directors will have the sole discretion to cancel any stock-based awards granted and to take such action, as permitted by law, as it deems necessary to recover all or a portion of any bonus or incentive compensation paid and recoup any gains realized in respect of equity-based awards, provided recoveries cannot extend back more than three years. Additionally, under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, if we are required to restate our financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements as a result of misconduct, our CEO and CFO must reimburse us for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 12 months following the first public issuance of the non-complying document, and any profits realized from the sale of our securities during those 12 months. Stock Ownership Guidelines . To underscore the importance of strong alignment between the interests of management and shareholders, the board of directors approved stock ownership guidelines for directors and executives, with our CEO having the highest ownership requirement. Director and executive compensation are designed to provide a significant opportunity to tie individual rewards to long-term Company performance. The objective of our stock ownership guidelines is to support this overall philosophy of alignment and to send a positive message to our shareholders, customers, suppliers, and employees of our commitment to shareholder value. Each director and executive officer is expected to maintain minimum share ownership of either: (i) the number of shares with a value based on a multiple of base salary or director annual retainer listed below, or (ii) the number of shares listed below: Multiple of Director Annual Retainer and Executive Base Salary Number of Shares 2 Years 4 Years 2 Years 4 Years Directors 3x 6x 15,000 45,000 CEO 2.5x 5x 125,000 250,000 Senior Vice Presidents 0.5x 2x 15,000 75,000 Other Executive Officers — 0.5x 2,500 15,000 Stock ownership that is included toward attainment of the guidelines includes (i) shares held of record or beneficially owned, either directly or indirectly; (ii) shares acquired upon exercise of stock options or SSARs; (iii) vested restricted or deferred shares; (iv) phantom or deferred share units held in a deferred compensation plan; and (v) shares or deferred shares acquired by dividend reinvestment. Directors and executives are expected to attain the specified target ownership levels within both two and four years from the later of the effective date of this policy or becoming a director or an executive and remain at or above that level until retirement. Annually, the board of directors reviews progress toward achieving these ownership levels. Director and executives who have not attained the specified ownership guidelines will be required to hold 75% of shares acquired upon exercise of stock options and SSARs or vesting of performance or restricted shares until they meet their target ownership level. If ownership guidelines are not met within two and four years, our Compensation Committee has the right to pay an executive’s annual incentives in shares until ownership guidelines are achieved. Stock Retention Policy . Under the Company’s stock retention policy, directors and executive officers are required to hold shares of Company stock for at least one year after such shares vest in the case of performance or restricted shares, or one year after exercise in the case of stock options or SSARs, or until the earlier date of their termination of service as a director or executive officer. The holding period policy does not apply in instances of a “change in control,” as defined in the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. 15 Impact of Tax Considerations . Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, through December 31, 2017, limited the tax deductio n of public companies for compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid to their CEO and the three most highly compensated executive officers (other than the CFO) at the end of any fiscal year unless the compensation qualified as “performance-based compensat ion” Under applicable IRS regulations. For tax years after December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 amended Section 162(m) to expand the $1.0 million deduction limitation described above to a larger group of employees and to eliminate the “perf ormance-based” exception. The employees (referred to as “covered employees”) to whom the deduction limitation applies include the CEO and CFO (in each case, whether or not serving as executive officers as of the end of the fiscal year) and the three other most highly compensated executive officers. In addition, once considered a “covered employee” for a given year, the individual will be treated as a “covered employee” for all subsequent years. The Compensation Committee has considered the effect of Section 162(m) on the Company’s executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee exercises discretion in setting base salaries, structuring incentive and long-term compensation awards and in determining payments in relation to levels of achievement of performance goals. The Compensation Committee believes that the total compensation program for Named Executive Officers should be managed in accordance with the objectives outlined in the Committee’s compensation philosophy and in the best overall interests of the Company’s shareholders. Accordingly, compensation paid by the Company may not be deductible because such compensation exceeds the limitations for deductibility under Section 162(m). COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with the Company’s management. Based on that review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be incorporated in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, and included in the Company’s Proxy Statement for its 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors Melvin Keating, Chairman Michael A. Kaufman Jerry Jones John Mutch 16 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The following table and related notes provide information regarding fiscal year 2020 compensation for our Named Executive Officers, including our CEO and CFO, and the other three most highly compensated executive officers whose total compensation exceeded $100,000 for fiscal year 2020.

Option Awards include SSAR grants. Amounts disclosed do not represent the economic value received by the Named Executive Officers. The value, if any, recognized upon the exercise of a SSAR will depend upon the market price of the shares on the date the SSAR is exercised. The value, if any, recognized for restricted and performance shares will depend upon the market price of the shares upon vesting. In accordance with SEC rules, the values for restricted and performance shares and SSARs are equal to the aggregate grant date fair value for each award computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The values for restricted and performance shares are based on the closing price on the grant date. For Mr. Srinivasan, $450,000 of the stock award consisted of shares of restricted common stock which were subject to performance conditions, and the amount recorded above is based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions on the date of grant. In fiscal year 2020, Mr. Srinivasan was granted $114,750 of the award, as described above in the CD&A, and in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, he was granted $533,340 and $225,000 of the award, respectively. The remainder of the stock award for Mr. Srinivasan consisted of the grant of 600,000 SSARs in connection with his new employment agreement in February 2020. Of the 600,000 SSARs granted to Mr. Srinivasan, the values for 475,000 SSARs are based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the values for 125,000 SSARs was based on the Lattice option pricing model that utilizes a binomial tree to forecast option pricing. For the other Named Executive Officers, the values for SSARs are based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. A discussion of the assumptions used in determining these valuations is set forth in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company’s 2020 Annual Report. For Stock Awards, the amounts shown represent grants of restricted shares to each Named Executive Officer as part of the executive’s annual long-term equity grant. (2) Amounts represent annual incentive payments received for 2020, 2019, and 2018 based on pre-set incentive goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year and tied to the Company’s financial, strategic, and operational goals.

Total target, and maximum payouts were conditioned on achievement of goals based on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and end of year cash balance for each Named Executive Officer other than Mr. Srinivasan. As discussed in the CD&A above, for those Named Executive Officers, cash-based annual incentives could be paid at less than threshold payment level provided that threshold performance was achieved. Fiscal year 2020 payouts for each Named Executive Officer pursuant to these awards are shown in the Summary Compensation Table above in the column titled Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. Further explanation of potential and actual payouts by component is set forth in the CD&A. (2) Long-term equity incentives for Mr. Srinivasan consisted of shares of restricted common stock which would vest based on the achievement of goals based on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and end of year cash balance. Achievement of performance goals would have earned him common shares equal to $450,000, which would have equaled the target level of shares set forth in the table based on the grant date fair market value of $22.41 per share. Similarly, the threshold and maximum potential shares set forth in the table are based on the threshold and maximum incentive amounts of $225,000 and $900,000, respectively, at the grant date value of $22.41 per share. Mr. Srinivasan earned 6,714 shares for performance at 25.5% of target based on a determination date value of $17.09 per share. Further explanation of potential and actual payouts is set forth in the CD&A. (3) The share amounts shown represent grants of restricted shares to each Named Executive Officer as part of the executive’s annual long-term equity grant. The restricted shares are exercisable in thirds beginning on March 31, 2020. 18 (4) The share amounts represent SSARs granted at the fair ma rket value of the shares on the grant date as fiscal year 2020 long-term incentive awards. For Mr. Srinivasan, 475,000 SSARs will vest in equal monthly amounts for three years following the grant date, subject to Mr. Srinivasan’s continued employment with the Company, and the remaining 125,000 SSARs will vest pro rata daily if the closing price of the Company’s stock has been equal to or higher than $45 per share for 15 business days, regardless of the price performance thereafter . Mr. Srinivasan’s SSARs aw ards have a four -year and six-month term. For the other Named Executive Officers, the SSARs are exercisable in thirds beginning on March 31, 2020. All other SSARs have a seven-year term. (5) The dollar amount shown for each equity grant represents the grant date fair value of the SSARs and restricted shares, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The actual value, if any, recognized upon the exercise of a SSAR or vesting of restricted shares will depend upon the market price of the shares on the date the SSAR is exercised or restricted shares vest.

Termination and Change of Control The following table and discussion summarize certain information related to the total potential payments which would have been made to the Named Executive Officers in the event of termination of their employment with the Company, including in the event of a change of control, effective March 31, 2020, the last business day of fiscal year 2020, assuming that the current employment agreements with each of our Named Executive Officers had been in effect at such time. Employment Agreements. The Named Executive Officers are each a party to an employment agreement with the Company, other than Mr. Pritchett, whose employment with the Company terminated after the end of fiscal year 2020. If Mr. Srinivasan’s employment agreement is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Srinivasan for good reason, then subject to his execution of a release of claims, Mr. Srinivasan will be entitled to receive severance equal to two years’ then-current base salary and two times the value of his target annual bonus performance shares, which will be paid during regular pay intervals over the course of two years. In addition, he will also receive (a) a lump sum payment in cash, on the 60th day after the termination date, equal to the total after-tax premiums required to pay for 24 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s medical, dental and vision insurance plans; (b) a lump sum payment in cash of his pro-rated bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance with no negative discretion by the Board; and (c) twelve (12) months of accelerated vesting of all equity compensation awards that are subject to time or service-based vesting and were unvested and outstanding on the termination date. However, if notice of non-renewal is given within the last 12 months of the initial three-year employment term severance will only be paid for a 12-month period. If such termination occurs within three months before or 24 months after a change in control, Mr. Srinivasan will receive two times the sum of his then-current base salary and target annual bonus, two times the COBRA payment and 100% release of any post-closing restrictions related to equity awards that were deemed vested as a result of the change of control. In addition, upon any termination of employment, Mr. Srinivasan will receive accrued but unpaid base salary and payment for any unused vacation and unreimbursed expenses. For Mr. Srinivasan, good reason means (i) a reduction in his base salary or target bonus opportunity, (ii) a material diminution in his authority, duties or responsibilities (including, without limitation, his no longer being the CEO of a publicly-traded company or the requirement that he report to anyone other than the Company’s board of directors or following a change in control he is not made the chief executive officer of the ultimate parent of the resulting entity), (iii) his removal as a member of the board of directors (other than by his voluntary resignation), (iv) any other action that constitutes a willful and material breach by the Company of a material provision of his employment agreement, (v) a material reduction in the benefits provided to him that is not part of a broader reduction of benefits applicable to substantially all other officers of the Company, or (vi) a material breach of the agreement by the Company (including a failure to pay current compensation or benefits when due), and the Company fails to materially cure such condition within 30 days of notice of the breach. For the other Named Executive Officers, good reason is limited to where the Company changes the Named Executive Officer’s position such that his compensation or responsibilities are substantially lessened, and the Company fails to cure such situation within 30 days after notice. If the Company terminates the employment of any of the other Named Executive Officers without cause, we must pay severance equal to 12 month’s salary and reimbursement of the executive’s total premium for 12 months of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s health benefit plans. If the executive’s compensation is reduced by more than 10%, other than a general reduction that affects all similarly situated executives, or if at any time prior to a change in control the executive no longer reports to the CEO, the executive may terminate his employment if the Company fails to materially cure such condition within 30 days following notice of such condition by the executive, and the termination will be deemed to be a termination without cause and the executive is entitled to his or her severance benefits. In the event that any of these Named Executive Officers are terminated without cause or by the executive for good reason in the 24 months following a change of control of the Company, the executive is entitled to severance pay equal to 12 months’ 20 salary and a pro rata portion of target annual incentive and reimbursement of the executive’s total premium for 12 months’ of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s health benefit. During the term of his employment and for 24 months thereafter, Mr. Srinivasan is subject to the Company’s standard confidentiality and non-disclosure requirements, as well as non-competition and non-solicitation obligations, except that if the term of the employment agreement expires at the end of the initial three-year term, the non-competition provisions will only apply for 12 months following termination.

(2) For Mr. Srinivasan, “cause” is defined as (i) conviction of a crime involving misappropriation of money or other property or conviction of a felony, or a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere with respect to a felony, (ii) conduct that is Prohibited Activity under the non-competition section of his employment agreement, (iii) conduct that breaches his duty of loyalty to the Company or his willful misconduct, any of which materially injures the Company, (iv) a willful and material breach of his material obligations under any agreement entered into between him and the Company that materially injures the Company, or (v) failure to substantially perform his reasonable duties with the Company (other than by reason of his disability) that materially injures the Company. For the other Named Executive Officers, “cause” is defined as (i) breach of employment agreement or any other duty to the Company, (ii) dishonesty, fraud, or failure to abide by the published ethical standards, conflicts of interest, or material breach of Company policy, (iii) conviction of a felony crime or crime involving misappropriation of money or other Company property, or (iv) misconduct, malfeasance, or insubordination. For Mr. Srinivasan, good reason means (i) a reduction in base salary or target bonus opportunity, (ii) a material diminution in authority, duties or responsibilities (including, without limitation, no longer being the CEO of a publicly-traded company or the requirement that he report to anyone other than the Company’s Board of Directors or following a Change in Control he is not made the chief executive officer of the ultimate parent of the resulting entity), (iii) removal as a member of the Board (other than by voluntary resignation), or failure to be appointed to the board of directors of the ultimate parent of any resulting entity following a change in control, (iv) any other action that constitutes a willful and material breach by Agilysys of a material provision of his employment agreement, (v) a material reduction in the benefits provided to him that is not part of a broader reduction of benefits applicable to substantially all other officers of the Company, or (vii) a material breach of his employment agreement by Agilysys, including the failure to pay his current compensation or benefits when due. For the other Named Executive Officers, good reason means (i) a reduction in base salary or target bonus eligibility by more than 10% from its then current level, other than a general reduction in base salary or target bonus eligibility that affects all similarly situated executives in substantially the same proportions, or (ii) at any time prior to a change in control of the Company, the Named Executive Officer no longer reports to the CEO, and the Company fails to cure any such situation within 30 days after notice. (3) Health Insurance consists of health care and dental care benefits. The amount reflects reimbursement of COBRA benefits for the applicable period. 21 (4) Severance payments in the event of a change of control are subject to a double trigger such that severance benefits are pr ovided only upon a combination of a change of control and a qualified termination. SSARs and restricted shares vest upon a change of control. For SSARs the value of accelerated vesting is calculated using the closing price of $16.70 per share on March 31, 2020, less the exercise price per share for the total number of SSARs accelerated. The value of restricted shares upon vesting reflects that same $16.70 closing price. Values represent potential vesting under a hypothetical change of control situation on M arch 31, 2020. (5) All SSARs vest upon death or disability. 22 Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS Issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 1,735,457 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to MAK Capital Fund L.P., a Bermuda Islands limited partnership and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Related Purchasers”) pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and MAK Capital. The terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Amendment to the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company, which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio on May 22, 2020. The terms of the transaction were reviewed and approved by a special Transaction Committee of independent directors, which engaged J. Wood Capital Advisors as financial advisor. On May 22, 2020, the Company and the Related Purchasers also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, the Company granted the Related Purchasers certain customary demand, shelf and piggyback registration rights. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to file within three months of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement (the “Closing”), and cause to be declared effective as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof and no later than six months of the date of the Closing, a shelf registration statement registering the public resale of the shares of common stock of the Company issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock. Policy on Approval of Related Person Transactions All related person transactions with the Company require the prior approval or ratification by our Audit Committee. The board of directors adopted Related Person Transaction Procedures to formalize the procedures by which our Audit Committee reviews and approves or ratifies related person transactions. The procedures set forth the scope of transactions covered, the process for reporting such transactions, and the review process. Covered transactions include any transaction, arrangement, or relationship with the Company in which any director, executive officer, or other related person has a direct or indirect material interest, except for business travel and expense payments, share ownership, and executive compensation approved by the board of directors. Transactions are reportable to the Company’s General Counsel, who will oversee the initial review of the reported transaction and notify the Audit Committee of transactions within the scope of the procedures, and the Audit Committee will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction. Through our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, we make a formal yearly inquiry of all of our executive officers and directors for purposes of disclosure of related person transactions, and any such newly revealed related person transactions are conveyed to the Audit Committee. All officers and directors are charged with updating this information with our internal legal counsel. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE NASDAQ listing standards provide that at least a majority of the members of the board of directors must be independent, meaning free of any material relationship with the Company, other than his or her relationship as a director. The Guidelines state that the board of directors should consist of a substantial majority of independent directors. A director is not independent if he or she fails to satisfy the standards for director independence under NASDAQ listing standards, the rules of the SEC, and any other applicable laws, rules, and regulations. During the board of directors’ annual review of director independence, the board of directors considers transactions, relationships, and arrangements, if any, between each director or a director’s immediate family members and the Company or its management. In May 2020, the board of directors performed its annual director independence review and, as a result, determined that each of Donald Colvin, Dana Jones, Jerry Jones, Michael A. Kaufman, Melvin Keating, and John Mutch qualify as independent directors. Ramesh Srinivasan is not independent because of his service as President and CEO of the Company. 25 Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. The Audit Committee reviewed the fees of Grant Thornton LLP, our Independent Accountant for fiscal year 2020. Fees for services rendered by Grant Thornton for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were: Fiscal Year Audit Fees ($) Audit-Related Fees ($) Tax Fees ($) All Other Fees ($) 2020 660,565 10,993 2,561 — 2019 718,434 — 10,274 — “Audit Fees” consist of fees billed for professional services provided for the annual audit of our financial statements, annual audit of internal control over financial reporting, review of the interim financial statements included in quarterly reports, and services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. “Audit- Related Fees” relate to professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements. “Tax Fees” include tax compliance and tax consulting services. “All Other Fees” relate to professional services not included in the foregoing categories, including services related to other regulatory reporting requirements. The Audit Committee adopted an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy to ensure compliance with SEC and other rules and regulations relating to auditor independence, with the goal of safeguarding the continued independence of our Independent Accountant. The Pre-Approval Policy sets forth the procedures and conditions pursuant to which audit, review, and attest services and non-audit services to be provided to the Company by our Independent Accountant may be pre-approved. The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non- audit services performed by our Independent Accountant to assure that the provision of such services does not impair independence. Unless a type of service to be provided has received pre-approval as set forth in the Pre-Approval Policy, it will require separate pre-approval by the Audit Committee before commencement of the engagement. Any proposed service that has received pre-approval but which will exceed pre-approved cost limits will require separate pre-approval by the Audit Committee. All audit, non-audit, and tax services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee during fiscal years 2020 and 2019. 26 PART IV Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.

Business. Overview Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative guest-centric technology solutions for casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive solutions in the industry, including point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payment solutions, and related hospitality applications, to manage the entire guest journey. Agilysys is known for its leadership in hospitality, its broad product offerings and its customer-centric service. Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth, increase operational efficiencies and support social distancing. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. Our principal executive offices and corporate services are located at 1000 Windward Concourse, Suite 250, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30005. Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2020 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. History and Significant Events Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc. In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries. In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. In fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining operating units. In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market. In fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts. Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy, integrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship. Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from ongoing support and maintenance agreements, subscription services, cloud applications and professional services. 4 Products, Support and Professional Services We are a leading developer and marketer of software enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software solutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; support, maintenance and subscription services; and, professional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core solutions. We present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories: • Products (hardware and software) • Support, maintenance and subscription services • Professional services Total revenue for these three specific areas is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Products $ 44,230 $ 39,003 $ 33,699 Support, maintenance and subscription services 83,680 75,496 69,068 Professional services 32,847 26,343 24,593 Total $ 160,757 $ 140,842 $ 127,360 Products: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems. Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions' ability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases. Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting these offerings while market demand for maintenance services and updates that enhance reliability, as well as the desire for flexibility in purchasing options, continue to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud. Professional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive experience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money. Our portfolio of hospitality software solutions: The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated “platform-centric” solutions for Lodging and Food & Beverage functions, including the applications necessary to support this ecosystem. Our technology platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests before, during and post-visit. We offer an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve the guest experience, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our integrated yet modular products allow hospitality operators to recruit and retain customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest and improve the overall experience throughout the entire guest journey - from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions. 5 With our o mni- c hannel suite of software products, we are uniquely positioned to offer solutions that allow our customers to adhere to social distancing guidelines and offer contactless solutions at every point of the guest journey for our hospitality operators while maximizing operational efficiency. Point of Sale (POS) Solutions: Agilysys POS solution suite allows our customers to provide their guests with an omni-channel experience within their property. Guests are empowered to create their own experiences through ordering from a mobile device or walking up to a self-service kiosk, but also providing for a more traditional experience with staff by interacting with a cashier or bar, or having a server come to them. Irrespective of the channel of interaction for the guest, our POS suite provides a single integrated enterprise grade back office management system with robust reporting capabilities. This allows our customers to manage menus, price changes, purchasing trends, inventory management and sales reporting from a single integrated source providing for increased efficiency as well as providing a richer guest profile. Agilysys InfoGenesis® POS is an award-winning point of sale solution that combines a fast, intuitive and highly customizable terminal application with powerful, flexible reporting and configuration capabilities in the back office management portal. The system is easy to set up, and its scalable architecture enables customers to add workstations without having to build out expensive infrastructure.

Engineered for all regions of the world, the InfoGensis POS solution suite offers a multinational set of features, including language, currency and fiscal technology, coupled with a robust enterprise management capability enabling the largest global customers to run their business efficiently. With a modern integration platform of APIs, the solution is also capable of integrating with a variety of ancillary applications allowing our customers to keep their entire technology estate. InfoGenesis POS is available as a cloud-based or on-premise solution. Agilysys InfoGenesis Flex is a mobility solution that offers full point of sale functionality on a Windows tablet in 6, 8, or 10"" form factors. It provides a sleek, modern alternative to traditional point of sale installations and can be used as a slim fixed terminal or as a convertible mobile POS simply by removing the tablet from its base. Agilysys InfoGenesis KDS is a digital kitchen management solution that integrates with InfoGenesis, rGuest Buy® Kiosk and rGuest Buy OnDemand to deliver staff and customer originated orders to the kitchen for preparation. Custom attributes such as guest phone number, name, guest location or packaging instructions can be provided on each incoming order so the order can be fulfilled promptly to guests. Guests can optionally be notified of order completion via an order status monitor (OSM) or via text message. rGuest Buy Kiosk is an enterprise-class self-service, customer-facing point of sale solution for the hospitality industry. It is ideal for food & beverage venues such as buffets, grab 'n go, corporate cafeterias and food courts. Its flexibility supports a variety of operational workflows, such as ""order and pay"", ""order only"", ""pay at cashier"" and “self check-out,” and integrates with a variety of property management, casino management and loyalty systems. rGuest Buy Kiosk is currently deployed at more than 270 customer sites across the country, including corporate cafeterias at a top five U.S. bank, a top 40 U.S. law firm, one of the nation's largest technology manufacturers, and at a national financial services firm. rGuest Buy Kiosk’s intuitive guest-facing order and pay experiences transfer the control and convenience to the end user. The self-service components reduce on-site labor needed to manage venue operations, while improving guest throughput, check size, order accuracy, guest experience and satisfaction. The platform-driven and cloud-based solution allows for easy deployments and management at scale resulting in a lowered overall cost of ownership. 6 rGuest Buy OnDemand provides a visual, interactive food and beverage ordering experience to any mobile device - phone, tablet, laptop - with a browser-based self-service experience. Using a simple, intuitive interface, guests can easily order and reorder from anywhere across the property, driving order velocity and volume. rGuest Buy OnDemand allows our customers to immediately offer an online ordering platform that is natively integrated with their physical location operations. Menus and price updates can be done in one place and automatically updated across all channels – online web store, digital menus and app ordering as well as POS terminals. Orders placed online are routed automatically to the appropriate kitchen for preparation. Orders placed from all channels are automatically available on the POS terminal at the physical location. Property Management Systems (PMS): Agilysys offers the most comprehensive suite of property management applications to serve the needs of our integrated resort and hospitality customers. Our platforms enable our customers to provide a seamless experience to their guests while driving operational efficiencies throughout the value chain. Our PMS suite of applications consists of the core property management system, a commission free booking engine, self-service check in and check out solutions, spa, golf, retail, accounting, sales and catering, service request optimization and condo management applications. Agilysys Lodging Management System® (LMS™) is an on-premise or hosted, web and mobile-enabled, PMS solution targeting the operator with large, complex operations.

Focused on improving revenue and streamlining operations, rGuest Stay is designed to enable hotels to gather and analyze guest information across properties that can be used to create loyalty-generating offers and increase guest wallet share. In addition, running natively in a browser on both desktop and tablet devices, it delivers real-time operating metrics so that hotels can more accurately forecast demand and scale guest services accordingly. Virtual Check-in and Check-out Solutions Today’s hotels cater to guests with high expectations when it comes to technological efficiency. An emerging trend in the hotel industry that has accelerated in the COVID-19 environment, where social distancing is now the norm, is the ability for guests to check themselves in or out of their room without interacting with the front desk. To that end, we offer software modules that enable this approach and are fully integrated with our core PMS solutions. 7 rGuest Express Kiosk simplifies check-in and check-out, optimizes staff productivity and enhances the guest experience by enabling a seamless self-service option for guests to use in the hotel lobby at a kiosk. More properties are turning to kiosks to reduce overhead and offer more self-service options. With rGuest Express Kiosk, it’s easy to elevate service levels without adding front-line staff. rGuest Express Kiosk provides ID verification to allow for hotels to enforce security standards efficiently and to allow the guest to bypass the front desk and observe social distancing guidelines. rGuest Express Mobile simplifies check-in and check-out even further and at the same time allows operators to offer mobile keys, concurrent dining reservations or room upsells, all on a personal mobile device such as a smart phone or tablet. Properties are turning to mobility at an ever-increasing pace to improve efficiency. With rGuest Express Mobile, it’s easy to reduce wait times and empower guests by putting the power of choice in the palm of their hand. rGuest Express Mobile allows for digital ID verification before securely delivering the digital room key to the guest phone allowing operators to maintain security standards while allowing the guest to bypass the front desk. Point of Sale and Property Management Ecosystem Offerings: The following solutions integrate with and are complementary to our point of sale or property management systems, or both. These solutions, for the most part, can stand alone and do not require POS or PMS to be functional. However, we lead with our core POS and PMS solutions discussed above and focus on selling these complimentary ecosystem solutions into our customer base. rGuest® Pay payment processing solution is our innovative payment gateway. rGuest Pay protects guests’ financial data and reduces risk by leveraging point-to-point encryption (P2PE) and tokenization with every credit card transaction. rGuest Pay Gateway leverages one of the first payment gateways in the world to receive official PCI-P2PE validation, allowing us to offer PCI cost and scope reduction that other providers cannot. These security benefits are built on top of a full-featured, enterprise-grade gateway that offers broad support for U.S., Canadian, European and certain Asian countries’ credit card processors and a wide variety of payment device options for every use-case, including countertop, pay-at-table, EMV, mobile tablet, and signature capture scenarios. rGuest Pay offers contactless payment options on all markets as well as supporting various wallet payment options like Apple Pay®, Google Pay®, AliPay®, and WeChat®. rGuest Spa software covers all aspects of running a spa, from scheduling guests for services to managing staff schedules.

The solution allows booking of one or more rooms and is seamlessly connected with our core PMS solutions to provide a flawless experience for guests and hotel operators. rGuest Book is the only booking engine in the market that seamlessly integrates with the core primary gaming system and allows for casino operators to enable their patrons to self-book their entitlements resulting in increased guest satisfaction and reduced operational expenses.

Casino Vail Resorts Copper Mountain MGM Valley View Casino & Hotel Costa Pacifica Oxford Casino Vanderbilt University The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas Palm Garden Hotel Wendover Resorts Crystal Springs Resort Pinehurst Resort Yale University Industry and Markets We are a technology software solutions company exclusively focused on the hospitality industry for more than 4 decades. Our solutions are mission critical to core hospitality operations. Our software solutions are required to run the operations of the hospitality business and designed to drive substantial customer benefits through increased revenue, improved operational efficiency, enhanced guest experience and improved employee morale. In addition, many of our solutions enable social distancing capabilities for our customers. Our innovative software solutions described above have been purpose-built to serve the unique needs of the following hospitality sectors: casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. We operate across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. The sectors we serve are going through unprecedented and uncertain times with the COVID-19 pandemic. While the near-term outlook is hard to predict with closures and travel restrictions, these market sectors will recover. The long-term outlook remains strong and we expect the momentum from the last three years to eventually pick back up with a focus on social distancing and mobile applications. Prior to COVID-19, we estimated our total addressable market to be approximately $4.8 billion in annual recurring revenue opportunity. While the size of the opportunity might face pressure in an economic downturn, we feel it is still in the billions of dollars and we are only a fraction of that size. We continue to feel good about our opportunity to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the industry. Customers Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly fragmented. 10 Seasonality Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results. Competition Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., NCR, Constellation Software, Inc., Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies like POSitouch, Northwind and Appetize Technologies. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains. Environmental Matters We believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations. Employees As of March 31, 2020, we had 1,275 employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, have had no strikes or work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.

Risks Relating to Our Business COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time. The global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 is complex and rapidly evolving and has resulted in disruption to our business, the hospitality industry and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led government and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, gatherings of large numbers of people, and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced demand for gaming, hotels, resorts, cruises, corporate foodservice, restaurants, university cafeterias, and stadia and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across these hospitality industries that we serve, and in some cases, has caused the closure of our customers’ businesses. Business closures have resulted in our inability to complete certain implementations and negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue. We have also taken impairments on certain of our rGuest solutions based upon the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to adversely impact our business, operations, and financial results significantly depends on the effect upon the demand for our customers’ hospitality services, which may be affected by, among other things, the duration and scope of COVID-19 (including whether and to what extent a resurgence of the virus could occur after the pandemic initially subsides); the negative impact it has on global regional economies and economic activity, including its impact on unemployment rates and consumer confidence and discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demand for hospitality businesses; the ability of our customers to successfully navigate the impacts of COVID-19; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies, travel activity, businesses, universities and demand for lodging, destination resorts, cruises and stadia events recovers after the pandemic subsides. To the extent that our hospitality customers’ businesses continue to be impacted, it may have the following effects on our business: • Effect on Revenue and Liquidity: If our hospitality customers continue to have a material decline in their revenues, they could be unable to continue to pay for our services, and potentially even go out of business. If our customers are unable or unwilling to continue to pay for our services on a timely basis or at all, our revenue and liquidity would be adversely affected. • Effect on Growth: As a result of the material decline in our hospitality customers’ revenue, our customers and prospective customers have substantially curtailed new technology purchases. Customers may also have difficulty obtaining new 11 financing or drawing on existing credit facilities, resulting in them having diminished capital to spend on new technology purchases. F inally, customers or prospective customers may delay, terminate or not go forward with projects in development, for which we may have sold or software. Additionally, in response to COVID-19, we have taken steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency, including furloughing approximately 24% of our employees in the United States, APAC and EMEA. Such steps, and further changes we may make in the future to reduce our costs, may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, including furloughed employees potentially not returning to work with us when the COVID-19 public health emergency subsidies. If this were to occur, we may experience operational challenges that result in a negative impact on our customer services and ultimately, loss of market share, which could limit our ability to grow and expand our business. Our business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions. We conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including in areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), geopolitical conditions (such as political unrest and armed conflicts), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously purchased products and services. For example, our business is impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in energy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in air travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. As discussed above under “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time,” our performance has been affected by these conditions associated with COVID-19 and could be materially affected going forward if these conditions worsen or continue for an extended period or in other circumstances that we are unable to foresee or mitigate. Even after COVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities. Similarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which may adversely affect demand for our customers’ restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity. Our business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes. We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the supply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with international supply. For example, the Trump Administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. foreign trade policy, including imposing greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs, including on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply costs, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance. Our business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we will need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer's needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. The development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including: • Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements; • Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers; and • Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products, such as mobile devices. Our product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will, if ever, receive significant revenues from these investments. 12 If we are not successful in managing these risks and chal lenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. If we fail to meet our customers' performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal liability. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high quality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers' performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions, breaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions or breaches adversely impact our customers' businesses. In addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers' businesses. While our contracts typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for errors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability. We face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services. Several companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future. We compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or services, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity. We are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information; we are also subject to cyber-attacks. A failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws or the occurrence of a cyber-attack could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. We collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers’ and employees’ personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security such as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or potential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers. 13 We have established practices and procedures intended to protect our systems and information against cyber-attacks. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent all cyber-attacks from impacting our systems and information. Our systems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers. Any operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiab le information or personal data) could harm our relationship with our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities. Our software may be used in connection with processing sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the customer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our support and other systems, we cannot assure that our customers' systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access can be prevented. If a customer, or other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach, our business could be adversely affected. We have incurred losses in each of the last several years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future. We have incurred operating losses in each of the last several years, including the year ended March 31, 2020, and we may continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to invest in our products. Our lack of profitability limits the resources available to us to invest in developing new products, product upgrades and services and otherwise in improving business operations. We may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results. As of March 31, 2020, we had $19.6 million and $8.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets (including capitalized software development costs), net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis. As of March 31, 2020, we determined the net realizable value of intangible assets consisting of capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in significantly lower sales and cash flow projections for the related rGuest solutions after evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software. As a result, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future. If we fail to attract, retain and motivate key employees, our business may be harmed. Our success depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, retain and motivate the personnel that we need. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate sufficiently experienced and capable personnel, especially in product development, customer services and support, operations, sales and management, our business and financial results may suffer. For example, if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled technical personnel, our ability to develop high quality products and provide high quality customer service may be impaired. Experienced and capable personnel in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. Although we believe our compensation, benefits and other employment amenities are competitive in the markets in which we compete for talent, we may have difficulty attracting sufficiently experienced and capable personnel or retaining and motivating talented employees, and in such events our business may suffer. Additionally, in response to COVID-19, we furloughed approximately 24% of our employees to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. If this action negatively impacts our ability to attract employees or if employees do not resume their employment at the end of the furlough, we may experience operational challenges that result in a negative impact on our customer services and ultimately, loss of market share, which could limit our ability to grow and expand our business. See “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time” above for additional information regarding this risk. Our international operations have many associated risks. We continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and 14 challenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. We have international offices in the United Kingdom, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and India. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support channels in key international markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and difficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and managing foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing integrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs, enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; currency fluctuations; and political and economic instability abroad. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research and development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our administrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is concentrated in our India research and development center. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, a natural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location that prevents or substantially impairs our employees’ ability to work could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers. We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. This lawsuit remains pending. If we fail to maintain our data centers and other systems, the demand for our subscription services and our ability to operate our business efficiently could diminish, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We currently utilize data center hosting facilities, some of which are managed by third-parties, to provide cloud-based products and hosting services to our customers and to support our internal business operations. If these data center facilities fail or encounter any damage, it could result in interruptions in services to our customers or disruption of our business operations. This could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers, and in turn, our reputation and business could be adversely affected. Similarly any significant disruption or deficiency in the operation of our internal systems could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. 15 We have encountered risks associated with maintaining large cash balances. While we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts, if any. If we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits. As part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Some of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to litigation, which may be costly. As a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such litigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact on our business. Our dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them. We rely on a concentrated number of vendors for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs. We do not have long term agreements with many of these vendors. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services needs from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner programs, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it may have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins. Risks Relating to the Industries We Serve Our business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and a weakening could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Because our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business is largely dependent on the health of that industry. Our sales are dependent in large part on the health of the hospitality industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality industry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, as discussed above, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. For additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, see “COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time” above for additional information. Consolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business. Customers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry. Although recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance that future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider's products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services from us, which could have an adverse effect our business. 16 Insolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversel y affect our business. Customers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Most of our customers have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our customers to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property. Customers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Our Stock Our stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. Our stock price has been volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended March 31, 2020, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a high close of $36.85 to a low close of $13.00. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: • uncertainties the COVID-19 pandemic has caused for the global economy; • economic news or other events generally causing volatility in the trading markets; • our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of securities analysts to publish reports about us or our business; • announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; • our ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis; • any major change in our board or management; general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism. On May 11, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $20.1676 per share. Until converted, the preferred stock may impede stock price increases above the conversion price. Additionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the volatility of our common share price over time. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our corporate headquarters are located in Alpharetta, Georgia where we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space. In addition, we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, 12,000 square feet of office space in Bellevue, Washington, 12,000 square feet of office space in Santa Barbara, California, and 6,000 square feet of warehouse space in Roswell, Georgia. Internationally, we lease approximately 104,000 square feet of office space in Chennai, India and lease several other smaller office locations throughout Europe and Asia. Our major leases contain renewal options for periods of up to 10 years. We believe that our current facilities and office space are sufficient to meet our needs and do not anticipate any difficulty securing additional space as needed. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of any current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. Most of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. Cases against us and our co-defendants remained pending in the District Court with respect to one surviving Ameranth patent. In September 2018, the District Court found that patent invalid, and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In early 2019, Ameranth appealed the District Court's summary judgment ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 17 Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Sho rtly thereafter, Ameranth moved for a rehearing en banc, which was denied in February 2020. Finally, Ameranth filed for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has not yet responded to the writ. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or writ of certiorari may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys’ fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the remaining claims in the lawsuit, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 18 Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Market Information Our common shares, without par value, are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “AGYS”. As of May 20, 2020, there were 1,551 registered holders of our common shares, without par value. Dividends We did not pay dividends in fiscal 2020 or 2019 on our common stock and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. The current policy of the Board of Directors is to retain any available earnings for use in the operations of our business. Shareholder Return Performance Presentation The following chart compares the value of $100 invested in our common shares, including reinvestment of dividends, with a similar investment in the Russell 2000 Index (the “Russell 2000”) and with the companies listed in the SIC Code 7373-Computer Integrated Systems Design for the period March 31, 2015 through March 31, 2020. The stock price performance in this graph is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of our common shares. 19 Comparison of 5 Year Cumulative Total Return INDEXED RETURNS Fiscal Years Ended March 31, Base Period Company Name / Index 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Agilysys, Inc. $ 100.00 $ 103.76 $ 96.04 $ 121.44 $ 215.14 $ 169.72 Russell 2000 $ 100.00 $ 90.24 $ 113.90 $ 127.33 $ 129.94 $ 98.77 Peer Group $ 100.00 $ 87.03 $ 106.85 $ 123.24 $ 128.15 $ 122.52 This performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. 20 Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following selected consolidated financial and operating data was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, and Item 7 contained in Part II of this Annual Report. Year ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Operating results Net revenue $ 160,757 $ 140,842 $ 127,360 $ 127,678 $ 120,366 Gross profit 80,952 73,880 64,417 63,785 68,106 Operating loss (34,061 ) (13,081 ) (12,080 ) (11,408 ) (4,313 ) Operating loss, net of taxes (34,067 ) (13,164 ) (8,350 ) (11,721 ) (3,765 ) Net loss $ (34,067 ) $ (13,164 ) $ (8,350 ) $ (11,721 ) $ (3,765 ) Per share data (1) Basic and diluted Net loss $ (1.47 ) $ (0.57 ) $ (0.37 ) $ (0.52 ) $ (0.17 ) Weighted-average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 23,233 23,037 22,801 22,615 22,483 Balance sheet data at year end Cash and cash equivalents $ 46,653 $ 40,771 $ 39,943 $ 49,255 $ 60,608 Working capital 23,985 21,193 19,343 27,183 41,401 Total assets 154,562 163,591 157,207 167,305 185,157 Total debt 49 57 177 237 333 Total shareholders’ equity 71,757 100,622 108,431 113,669 123,473 (1) When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. In addition, when a loss from continuing operations is reported, adjusting the denominator of diluted earnings per share would also be anti-dilutive to the loss per share, even if the entity has net income after adjusting for a discontinued operation. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 21 Item 7. Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report titled, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 3 of this Annual Report and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic During the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020, concerns related to the spread of COVID-19 began to create global business disruptions as well as disruptions in our operations and to cause negative impacts on our revenues and other financial results. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our financial condition or results of operations is currently uncertain and depends on various factors, including the impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. We have taken actions to mitigate the impact on our business. We are currently conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. We have observed other organizations making similar alterations to their normal business operations, including restrictions imposed by our customers on our ability to access their sites for implementations and support. The pandemic could have an adverse impact on demand for our customers’ products and services, which in turn could negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue, and could also negatively impact the payment of accounts receivable and collections. In addition, during the first quarter of our fiscal 2021, we have reduced discretionary costs, implemented a hiring freeze on non-essential positions and reduced payroll and related costs through layoffs, employee furloughs, employee retirement benefit limitations, and salary decreases for executive team members and certain other employees of the Company. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as the situation evolves. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative guest-centric technology solutions for casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive software solutions in the industry, including point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payment solutions, and related hospitality applications, to manage the entire guest journey. Agilysys is known for its leadership in hospitality, its broad product offerings and its customer-centric service. Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth, increase operational efficiencies and support social distancing. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia. 22 Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to existing software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: • Putting the customer first • Accelerating our product development • Improving our liquidity • Increasing organizational efficiency and teamwork • Developing our employees and leaders • Growing revenue by improving the breadth and depth of our product set across both our well-established products and our newer rGuest platform • Growing revenue through international expansion The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, turning profitable and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue – We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances. • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. 23 Results of Operations Fiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019: Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 44,230 $ 39,003 $ 5,227 13.4 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 83,680 75,496 8,184 10.8 % Professional services 32,847 26,343 6,504 24.7 % Total net revenue 160,757 140,842 19,915 14.1 % Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 36,427 31,811 4,616 14.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 19,248 15,895 3,353 21.1 % Professional services 24,130 19,256 4,874 25.3 % Total cost of goods sold 79,805 66,962 12,843 19.2 % Gross profit 80,952 73,880 7,072 9.6 % Gross profit margin 50.4 % 52.5 % Operating expenses: Product development 41,463 37,817 3,646 9.6 % Sales and marketing 19,864 19,646 218 1.1 % General and administrative 24,374 23,118 1,256 5.4 % Depreciation of fixed assets 2,574 2,504 70 2.8 % Amortization of intangibles 2,541 2,567 (26 ) (1.0 )% Impairments 23,740 — 23,740 100.0 % Restructuring, severance and other charges 582 1,168 (586 ) (50.2 )% Legal settlements, net (125 ) 141 (266 ) (188.7 )% Operating loss $ (34,061 ) $ (13,081 ) $ (20,980 ) 160.4 % Operating loss percentage (21.2 )% (9.3 )% 24 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2020 2019 Net revenue: Products 27.5 % 27.7 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 52.1 53.6 Professional services 20.4 18.7 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold: Products, inclusive of developed technology amortization 22.6 22.6 Support, maintenance and subscription services 12.0 11.3 Professional services 15.0 13.6 Total net cost of goods sold 49.6 47.5 Gross profit 50.4 52.5 Operating expenses: Product development 25.8 26.9 Sales and marketing 12.4 13.9 General and administrative 15.2 16.4 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.6 1.8 Amortization of intangibles 1.6 1.8 Impairments 14.8 0.0 Restructuring, severance and other charges 0.4 0.8 Legal settlements, net (0.1 ) 0.1 Operating loss (21.2 )% (9.3 )% Net revenue. Total revenue increased $19.9 million, or 14.1%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Products revenue increased $5.2 million, or 13.4%, due to increased sales in third-party hardware sales including new customers and expansion with existing customers. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $8.2 million, or 10.8%, driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 24.3% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Professional services revenue increased $6.5 million, or 24.7%, due to ongoing installations and integration of our software solutions for our growing customer base. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $7.1 million, or 9.6%, in fiscal 2020 and total gross profit margin decreased from 52.5% to 50.4%. Products gross profit increased $0.6 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 18.4% to 17.6% due to a higher mix of third party hardware and software and due to certain allowances established against revenues earned in March 2020 related to products that have been or could be returned from customer locations closed in response to COVID-19 guidelines. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $4.8 million and gross profit margin decreased 195 basis points to 77.0% due to increased costs associated with hosting our customers. Professional services gross profit increased $1.6 million and gross profit margin decreased slightly from 26.9% to 26.5% after we established allowances against revenues earned in March 2020 due to uncertainties related to COVID-19 conditions. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, impairments and restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $5.2 million, or 6.0%, in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have decreased 4.3% in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $3.6 million, or 9.6%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the reduction of cost capitalization. The products in our rGuest platform for which we had capitalized costs reached general availability by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products joined our well-established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. We capitalized $2.0 million of external use software development costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs during fiscal 2019, with the full balance capitalized in Q1 fiscal 2019. We did not capitalize any costs associated with product development during fiscal 2020. Total product development costs, including operating expenses and capitalized amounts, were $41.5 million during fiscal 2020 compared to $40.1 million in fiscal 2019. The $1.4 million increase is mostly due to continued expansion of our R&D teams and infrastructure. 25 Sales and marketing. Sales and marke ting in creased $ 0. 2 million, or 1 . 1 %, in fiscal 20 20 compared with fiscal 20 19 . The change is due primarily to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts due to an increase collection risk of our accounts receivable as of March 31, 2020 as a result of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of our customers , partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our annual bonus incentive plan that has declined in value due to a significant decrease in target achievements af ter reduced fourth quarter revenue activity with concentration in March 2020 . General and administrative. General and administrative increased $1.3 million, or 5.4%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The change is due primarily to software investments in third-party applications to host our network and infrastructure. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $0.1 million or 2.8% in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles remained consistent in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Impairments. Impairments totaled $23.7 million in fiscal 2020. There were no impairments in fiscal 2019. The impairments result from specific capitalized software development costs supporting our rGuest solutions. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions which make it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the related rGuest solutions. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. We have recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Restructuring, severance and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges decreased $0.6 million due to a reduction in non-restructuring severance activity during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Legal settlements. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters.

Interest income consists of interest earned on short-term investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, money market funds and corporate-owned life insurance policies. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense, net. Other expense, net consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Year ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 $ % Income tax expense $ 201 $ 221 $ 20 9.0 % Effective tax rate (0.6 )% (1.7 )% For fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 26 Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the gener ation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible dif ferences. At March 31, 20 20 , we had $ 19 9.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 203 1 to 203 8 , and $2 4.7 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely . We also had $141.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2021 through 2040. Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018: Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 39,003 $ 33,699 $ 5,304 15.7 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 75,496 69,068 6,428 9.3 % Professional services 26,343 24,593 1,750 7.1 % Total net revenue 140,842 127,360 13,482 10.6 % Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 31,811 26,381 5,430 20.6 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 15,895 16,688 (793 ) (4.8 )% Professional services 19,256 19,874 (618 ) (3.1 )% Total cost of goods sold 66,962 62,943 4,019 6.4 % Gross profit 73,880 64,417 9,463 14.7 % Gross profit margin 52.5 % 50.6 % Operating expenses: Product development 37,817 27,936 9,881 35.4 % Sales and marketing 19,646 18,075 1,571 8.7 % General and administrative 23,118 24,028 (910 ) (3.8 )% Depreciation of fixed assets 2,504 2,631 (127 ) (4.8 )% Amortization of intangibles 2,567 1,879 688 36.6 % Restructuring, severance and other charges 1,168 1,798 (630 ) (35.0 )% Legal settlements, net 141 150 (9 ) (6.0 )% Operating loss $ (13,081 ) $ (12,080 ) $ (1,001 ) 8.3 % Operating loss percentage (9.3 )% (9.5 )% 27 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2019 2018 Net revenue: Products 27.7 % 26.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 53.6 54.2 Professional services 18.7 19.3 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 22.6 20.7 Support, maintenance and subscription services 11.3 13.1 Professional services 13.6 15.6 Total cost of goods sold 47.5 49.4 Gross profit 52.5 50.6 Operating expenses: Product development 26.9 21.9 Sales and marketing 13.9 14.2 General and administrative 16.4 18.9 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.8 2.1 Amortization of intangibles 1.8 1.5 Restructuring, severance and other charges 0.8 1.4 Legal settlements, net 0.1 0.1 Operating loss (9.3 )% (9.5 )% Net revenue. Total revenue increased $13.5 million, or 10.6% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Products revenue increased $5.3 million or 15.7%, due to growth in third-party hardware sales and in on premise software sales, which grew more than 20% compared to the prior year. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $6.4 million, or 9.3%, driven by growth in customers using our on premise software products that require the payment of support and maintenance along with continued increases in subscription based revenue, which increased 23.5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Subscription based revenue comprised 17.7% of total consolidated revenues in 2019 compared to 15.8% in 2018. Professional services revenue increased $1.8 million, or 7.1%, as a result of growth in our customer based including installations of our traditional on premise and subscription based software solutions and increased responses to customer service requests. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $9.5 million, or 14.7%, in fiscal 2019 and total gross margin increased from 50.6% to 52.5%. Products gross profit decreased $0.1 million and gross profit margin decreased 3.3% to 18.4% primarily as a result of increased developed technology amortization. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $7.2 million and gross profit margin increased 310 basis points to 78.9% due to the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit increased $2.4 million and gross profit margin increased 7.7% to 26.9% due to increased revenue with lower costs from the restructuring of our professional services workforce during the first quarter of 2018 into a more efficient operating structure with limited use of contract labor. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements and restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $11.1 million, or 14.9%, in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have increased 2.3% in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $9.9 million, or 35.4%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the reduction of cost capitalization. The products in our rGuest platform for which we had capitalized costs reached general availability by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products join our well-established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of products features and functions. We capitalized $2.0 million of external use software development costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs during fiscal 2019, with the full balance capitalized in Q1 fiscal 2019. We capitalized approximately $8.9 million in total development costs during fiscal 2018. Total product development costs, including operating expenses and capitalized amount, were $40.1 million during fiscal 2019 compared to $38.4 million in fiscal 2018. The $1.7 million increase is mostly due to continued expansion of our R&D teams and increased compensation expense as a result of bonus earnings. 28 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing in creased $ 1.6 million, or 8.7 %, in fiscal 20 19 compared with fiscal 20 18 . The change is due primarily to a n in crease of $ 1.6 million in incentive compensation related to an increase in sales, revenue and profitability during fiscal 2019. General and administrative. General and administrative decreased $0.9 million, or 3.8%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The change is due primarily to reduced outside professional costs for legal and accounting services. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.1 million or 5.0% in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles increased $0.7 million, or 36.6%, in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to our remaining rGuest suite of products being placed into service on June 30, 2018. Restructuring, severance and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges decreased $1.8 million due to non-recurring 2018 restructuring activities while charges for non-restructuring severance increased $1.2 million, resulting in a net decrease of $0.6 million during fiscal 2019. Legal settlements. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters.

The 2018 tax provision results primarily from a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act""). The 2018 effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the impact of the Tax Act, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. 29 Although the timing and outc ome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. At March 31, 2019, we had $210.6 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards of which $199.1 million will expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease and rental obligations at March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2020, all $46.7 million of our cash on hand was deposited in bank accounts, of which 93% are located in the United States. We believe there is limited credit risk with respect to our cash balances. While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic will have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations, we cannot presently estimate its financial impact, which we expect will be highly dependent on the severity and duration of the pandemic. As such, due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the indeterminate length of time it will affect the hospitality industry, we have taken certain proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to be able to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. These measures have included implementing strict cost management measures, such as temporarily halting marketing programs, temporarily eliminating non-essential expenses, including capital expenditures and reducing payroll and related costs through layoffs and furloughs as well as salary and retirement benefit reductions. In addition, we recently entered into an agreement to sell to MAK Capital One, LLC (“MAK Capital”) $35 million of convertible preferred stock carrying a 5.25% dividend that will be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $20.1676 per share. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close during May 2020. The close of the transaction will add $35 million in preferred stock to the Company’s balance sheet and increase our cash balance by the $35 million investment less estimated closing costs of approximately $1 million. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $46.7 million as of March 31, 2020, the additional $34 million in net proceeds from the preferred stock sales and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements. As of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. Cash Flow Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 10,575 $ 7,241 $ 6,874 Investing activities (3,447 ) (5,534 ) (15,085 ) Financing activities (1,116 ) (767 ) (1,295 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (130 ) (112 ) 194 Cash flows provided by (used in) operations $ 5,882 $ 828 $ (9,312 ) Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $10.6 million in fiscal 2020. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $34.1 million adjusted for $46.2 million in non-cash expense including impairment charges, depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation and a decrease of approximately $1.5 million in net operating assets and liabilities. 30 Cash flows provided by operating activities were $ 7.2 million in fiscal 201 9 . The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $13.2 million adjusted for $22.4 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation and an increase of approximately $2 million in net operating assets and liabili ties. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $6.9 million in fiscal 2018. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $12.1 million adjusted for $19.2 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation. Cash flow used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 were $3.4 million due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 were $5.5 million. This is primarily attributed to $2.2 million in capitalized development costs of proprietary software and $3.3 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2018 were $15.1 million. This is primarily attributed to $8.9 million in capitalized development costs of proprietary software and $6.1 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flow used in financing activities. Respectively, in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, the $1.1 million, $0.8 million, and $1.3 million cash flows used in financing activities were primarily comprised of the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding and to cover the exercise price of the options. Investments Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $0.9 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Contractual Obligations The following table provides aggregate information regarding our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2020. (In thousands) Total 2021 2022-2023 2024-2025 Thereafter Operating leases (1) $ 20,658 $ 4,927 $ 7,062 $ 4,768 $ 3,901 Finance leases 57 29 26 2 — Asset retirement obligation 170 131 25 — 14 Total contractual obligations (2) $ 20,885 $ 5,087 $ 7,113 $ 4,770 $ 3,915 (1) Operating lease obligations are presented net of contractually binding sub-lease arrangements. Additional information regarding our operating lease obligations is contained in Note 6, Leases. (2) At March 31, 2020, we had a $0.6 million liability reserve for unrecognized income tax positions which is not reflected in the table above. The timing of potential cash outflows related to the unrecognized tax positions is not reasonably determinable and therefore, is not scheduled. Substantially all of this reserve is included in Other non-current liabilities. Additional information regarding unrecognized tax positions is provided in Note 9, Income Taxes. We believe that cash on hand, funds from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to finance capital spending and working capital needs and to service our obligations and other commitments arising during the foreseeable future. 31 Critical Accounting Policies MD&A is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Reclassification. Certain prior year balances have been reclassed to conform to the current year presentation. Specifically, we reclassed certain employee benefit obligations from current to non-current liabilities. Revenue recognition. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after the adoption date are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under prior guidance. Revenue recognition under Topic 606 Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating the price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and bearing the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. 32 Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for cont racts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only be nefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cyc le in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk, as well as historic trends of the entire customer pool. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. To mitigate this credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. Customer credit allowance . We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount of customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many cases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we invoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested by the customer within the terms of our contract. Inventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, net of related reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or market, if necessary, are based upon contractual provisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. Income Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We recorded a valuation allowance of $66.8 million as of March 31, 2020 and $57.9 million as of March 31, 2019, related to substantially all of our deferred income tax assets in jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of a benefit from those assets. In the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our 33 net recorded amount, an adjustment to the tax valuation allowance would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 9, Income Taxes . Leases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are presented as Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities – current and operating lease liabilities – non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and corresponding liabilities are included in finance lease obligations – current and non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying asset and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments in exchange for the ability to use the asset for the duration of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and determined suing the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing since our leases do not include an implicit interest rate. The estimated incremental borrowing rate considers market data, actual lease economic environment, and actual lease term at commencement date. The lease term may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. ROU assets include lease payments made, and excludes any incentives received or initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which we account for as a single lease component. We also have leases which include variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred. Our variable lease payments are not based on an index or rate and therefore are exclude from the calculation of lease liabilities. We have elected to not recognize short term leases that have a term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities. Our short-term leases are not material and do not have a material impact on our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Additionally, we do not have any covenants, residual value guarantees, or related party transactions associated with our lease agreements. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist. The Company is also required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least annually, or when current events and circumstances require an interim assessment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Restructuring Charges. We recognize restructuring charges when a plan that materially changes the scope of our business, or the manner in which that business is conducted, is adopted and communicated to the impacted parties, and the expenses have been incurred or are reasonably estimable. Our restructuring reserves principally include estimates related to employee separation costs and the consolidation and impairment of facilities that will no longer be used in continuing operations. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. Facility reserves are calculated using a present value of future minimum lease payments, offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers. Present value is calculated using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term. Share-Based Compensation. We have a stock incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, time-vested restricted shares, restricted share units, performance-vested restricted shares, and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares. We record compensation expense related to stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and stock-settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. The fair value for stock-settled appreciation right awards tied to a market condition are estimated using the Lattice option pricing model which utilizes a binomial tree to forecast option pricing. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 13, Share-Based Compensation . Capitalized Software Development Costs. The capitalization of software development cost for external use begins when a product’s technological feasibility has been established. Capitalization ends when the resulting product is available for general market release. Amortization of the capitalized software is classified within products cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 34 For each capitalized software product, the annual amortization is equal to the greater of: (i) the amount c omputed using the ratio that the software product’s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or (ii) the amount computed based on straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, which is a range between three and eight years. The amount by which unamortized software costs exceeds the net realizable value, if any, is recognized as a charge to income in the period it is determined. We did not capitalize any software development costs during fiscal 2020. We capitalized approximately $2.0 million and $8.2 million during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization of developed capitalized software was $12.6 million, $1 2.6 million and $ 10 .0 million during fiscal 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 , respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the world pandemic related to COVID-19 and the resulting global economic environment impacted the expected growth of revenue related to our rGuest suite of products. The unamortized costs exceeded the net realizable value resulting in a charge to income during the fiscal year. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is provided in Note 5, Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs . Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2020-03, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments . ASU 2020-03 provides clarifications for questions and comments received regarding how changes to specific guidance related to financial instruments as a result of ASU No. 2016-13 interacts with other areas of the codification. The guidance was effective upon issuance of the ASU and correlates to the adoption of each of the applicable ASUs. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and will apply applicable changes from ASU 2020-03 in the period of adoption. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions previously allowed in the standard and simplifies the accounting for income taxes by providing additional guidance for certain tax situations. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASU 2019-04 provides corrections, updates and clarifications to the previously issued updates ASU 2016-13, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-01. Various areas of the codification were impacted from the update. The standard follows the effective dates of the previously issued ASUs, unless an entity has already early adopted the previous ASUs, in which case the effective date will vary according to each specific ASU adoption. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and the other two ASUs affected by ASU 2019-04 are not applicable to us. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract . ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) . ASU 2018-02 addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on items within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2019. While we have elected to reclassify any amount out of other comprehensive income, we do not have any amounts to reclassify and therefore the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 , Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires goodwill impairment to be measured as 35 the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are still assessing the impact of this standard, we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Unlike Accounting Standard Codification Topic 840 (“Topic 840”), which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The most prominent change for lessees is the requirement to recognize both Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under Topic 840. We adopted Topic 842 as of April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption. Refer to Note 6, Leases for further details. Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We have assets, liabilities, and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk. We sell products and services internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements. For the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue from international operations was 9%, 9% and 8%, respectively of total revenue. The effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the 2020, 2019 and 2018 fiscal years. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee, could materially impact our revenue, expenses, operating profit and net income. 36 Item 8.

Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilysys, Inc. (an Ohio corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated May 22, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of April 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases . Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2016. Atlanta, Georgia May 22, 2020 38 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders Agilysys, Inc. Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Agilysys, Inc. (an Ohio corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020, and our report dated May 22, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Nature of Operations Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia, airport foodservice and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive solutions in the industry, including point of sale (POS), property management systems (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the entire guest journey. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within the fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2020 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. COVID-19 Pandemic During the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020, concerns related to the spread of novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) began to create global business disruptions as well as disruptions in our operations and cause potential negative impacts on our revenues and other financial results. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our financial condition or results of operations is currently uncertain and depends on various factors, including the impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our business as of March 31, 2020, and the twelve month period then ended. As a result, we recorded impairments of our capitalized software development costs and certain internal use software as of the balance sheet date due to triggering events identified as of year-end. We also increased our allowance for doubtful accounts and our customer credit allowance due to the direct negative impact on our customers as of year-end. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Agilysys, Inc. and subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity or cost method, as appropriate. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated. Use of estimates. Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In particular, the economic disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse impact on our results for the year ended March 31, 2020, and we expect it to continue to have a material adverse impact on our results. As such, this annual period, as well as upcoming interim periods, are unlikely to be comparable to past performance or indicative of future performance. Cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity from date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Other highly liquid investments considered cash equivalents with no established maturity date are fully redeemable on demand (without penalty) with settlement of principal and accrued interest on the following business day after instruction to redeem. Such investments are readily convertible to cash with no penalty and can include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, money market funds and other investments. Allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as historic trends of the entire customer pool. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. To mitigate this credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. Customer credit allowance . We maintain allowances for estimated customer credits. Credits are typically due to the timing or amount of customer invoices processed for specific services, including professional and subscription, and maintenance coverage. In many cases, there has not been clear or timely communication of the need to adjust coverage or service at a location in advance of when we 45 invoice for the associated coverage or service. We will issue a credit after agreeing to the service or coverage adjustment as requested by the customer within the terms of our contract . Inventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of related reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, if necessary, are based upon contractual provisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors, including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. Leases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are presented as Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities – current and operating lease liabilities – non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net and corresponding liabilities are included in finance lease obligations – current and non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying asset, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments in exchange for the ability to use the asset for the duration of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date and determined using the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. We use an incremental borrowing rate based on estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing since our leases do not include an implicit interest rate. The estimated incremental borrowing rate considers market data, actual lease economic environment, and actual lease term at commencement date. The lease term may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. ROU assets include lease payments made in advance, and excludes any incentives received or initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which we account for as a single lease component. We also have leases which include variable lease payments, which are expensed as incurred. Our variable lease payments are not based on an index or rate and therefore are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. We have elected to not recognize short term leases that have a term of twelve months or less as ROU assets or lease liabilities. Our short-term leases are not material and do not have a material impact on our ROU assets or lease liabilities. Additionally, we do not have any covenants, residual value guarantees, or related party transactions associated with our lease agreements. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. The carrying amount of goodwill was $19.6 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist. The Company evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing its market capitalization based on its closing stock price (Level 1 input) to the book value of its equity on the annual evaluation date. Based on testing performed, the Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill has occurred for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company is also required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least annually, or when current events and circumstances require an interim assessment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are primarily amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over periods between two and eight years. Customer relationships are amortized over estimated useful lives between two and seven years; non-competition agreements are amortized over estimated useful lives between two and eight years; developed technology is amortized over estimated useful lives between three and eight years; supplier relationships are amortized over estimated useful lives between two and eight years. Long-lived assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance, repairs, and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under finance leases, which make up less than one percent of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements - 7 to 30 years; furniture - 7 to 10 years; equipment - 3 to 10 years; software - 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the economic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project's completion. Depreciation for capitalized project expenditures does not begin until the underlying project is completed. 46 We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscount ed cash flows attributable to such assets. Our long - lived assets and impairments considerations are discussed further in Note 4, Property and Equipment, net. Foreign currency translation. The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currencies are not in U.S. dollars are translated at the period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates during the fiscal year. The cumulative translation effects are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within shareholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an operation are reflected within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency gains and losses from changes in exchange rates have not been material to our consolidated operating results. Revenue recognition. We derive revenue from the sale of products (i.e., software, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. For the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue from international operations was 9%, 9% and 8%, respectively of total revenue. Our customer base is highly fragmented. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after the adoption date are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under prior guidance. Revenue recognition under Topic 606 Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance 47 obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Comprehensive (loss) income. Comprehensive (loss) income is the total of net (loss) income, as currently reported under GAAP, plus other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income considers the effects of additional transactions and economic events that are not required to be recorded in determining net (loss) income, but rather are reported as a separate statement of comprehensive (loss) income. Fair value measurements . We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. In determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use various valuation techniques. Additional information regarding fair value measurements is provided in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements . Investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies. Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with certain former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their respective designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $0.9 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities."" Additional information regarding the investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is provided in Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans . Income Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 9, Income Taxes . Capitalized Software Development Costs. The capitalization of software development cost for external use begins when a product’s technological feasibility has been established. Capitalization ends when the resulting product is available for general market release. Amortization of the capitalized software is classified within products cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For each capitalized software product, the annual amortization is equal to the greater of: (i) the amount computed using the ratio that 48 the software product’s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross r evenues for that product or (ii) the amount computed based on straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, which is a range between three and eight years. Annually, or more frequent as required by triggering events, an an alysis of the net realizable value of the capitalized software is completed and the amount by which unamortized software costs exceeds the net realizable value, if any, is recognized as a charge to income in the period it is determined . See further discuss ion regarding our capitalized software development costs in Note 5, Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs. Advertising and Promotion Expense. We expense advertising and promotion expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense was $2.7 million, $2.0 million and $2.7 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Reclassification. Certain prior year balances have been reclassed to conform to the current year presentation. Specifically, we reclassed certain employee benefit obligations from current to non-current liabilities. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2020-03, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments . ASU 2020-03 provides clarifications for questions and comments received regarding how changes to specific guidance related to financial instruments as a result of ASU No. 2016-13 interacts with other areas of the codification. The guidance was effective upon issuance of the ASU and correlates to the adoption of each of the applicable ASUs. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and will apply applicable changes from ASU 2020-03 in the period of adoption. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions previously allowed in the standard and simplifies the accounting for income taxes by providing additional guidance for certain tax situations. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASU 2019-04 provides corrections, updates and clarifications to the previously issued updates ASU 2016-13, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-01. Various areas of the codification were impacted from the update. The standard follows the effective dates of the previously issued ASUs, unless an entity has already early adopted the previous ASUs, in which case the effective date will vary according to each specific ASU adoption. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and the other two ASUs affected by ASU 2019-04 are not applicable to us. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract . ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) . ASU 2018-02 addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on items within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2019. While we have elected to reclassify any amount out of other comprehensive income, we do not have any amounts to reclassify and therefore the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 , Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are 49 still assessing the impact of this standard, we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impa ct on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Unlike Accounting Standard Codification Topic 840 (“Topic 840”), which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The most prominent change for lessees is the requirement to recognize both Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under Topic 840. We adopted Topic 842 as of April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption. Refer to Note 6, Leases for further details. Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 3. Revenue Recognition On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after the adoption date are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under prior guidance. For in depth discussion regarding our revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $44.2 million, $39.0 million, and $33.7 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $116.5 million, $101.8 million, and $93.7 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $37.0 million and $33.1 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we transferred from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $2.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, to accounts receivable because the right to the transaction became unconditional. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of March 31, 2020 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. For first year support and maintenance service contracts, commission expenses 50 are immaterial and therefore expenses as incurred. Other sales commission expenses are not m aterial or have a period of benefit of one year or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. As part of our 606 transition adjustments, we capitalized $1.9 million of sales incentive costs incurred in prior periods as of April 1, 2018. We had $3.2 million and $3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we expensed $4.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, of sales commission, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. Financial Statement Impact of Adoption on Previously Reported Results We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method beginning fiscal 2019. The cumulative impact of applying the new guidance to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of April 1, 2018 was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the adoption date. As a result of applying the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard, we also impacted accounts receivable, net, contract assets, prepaid expenses and other current assets, other non-current assets, contract liabilities and retained earnings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2018. The acceleration of revenue that was deferred under prior guidance as of the adoption date was primarily attributable to the requirement of Topic 606 to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative basis using SSP rather than allocating under the residual method, which allocates the entire arrangement discount to the delivered performance obligations. Due to the Company's full valuation allowance as of the adoption date, there was no tax impact associated with the adoption of Topic 606. We made certain presentation changes to our Consolidated Balance Sheet on April 1, 2018 to comply with Topic 606. Prior to adoption of the new standard, we offset accounts receivable and contract liabilities (previously presented as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet) for unpaid deferred performance obligations included in contract liabilities. Under the new standard, we record accounts receivable and related contract liabilities for non-cancelable contracts with customers when the right to consideration is unconditional. Upon adoption, the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time were reclassified from accounts receivable to contract assets. 4. Property and Equipment, Net P roperty and equipment at March 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Furniture and equipment $ 14,358 $ 11,604 Software 17,136 16,427 Leasehold improvements 7,012 6,981 Project expenditures not yet in use 50 1,014 38,556 36,026 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (24,592 ) (20,188 ) Impairments (1,734 ) — Property and equipment, net $ 12,230 $ 15,838 51 Total depreciation expense on property and equipment was $ 2.6 million, $2. 5 million, and $2. 6 million during fiscal 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 , respectively. The Company capitalizes internal-use software, including software used exclusively in providing services or that is only made available to customers as a software service, as property and equipment under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. Total amortization expense on capitalized internal-use software was $2.5 million, $2.5 million and $1.8 million during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered management to review property and equipment held by the Company for indicators of impairment. The carrying value of our capitalized costs for internal-use software related to our rGuest Seat solution did not exceed the estimated undiscounted cash flows, and utilizing a market approach, was determined to be fully impaired, resulting in $1.7 million of asset impairment charges in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Assets under financing leases are included in property and equipment categories above and further disclosed with Note 6. Leases . 5. Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs at March 31, 2020, and 2019: 2020 2019 Gross Net Gross Net carrying Accumulated carrying carrying Accumulated carrying (In thousands) amount amortization Impairment amount amount amortization amount Amortized intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 10,775 $ (10,775 ) $ - $ - $ 10,775 $ (10,775 ) $ - Non-competition agreements 2,700 (2,700 ) — — 2,700 (2,700 ) — Developed technology 10,398 (10,398 ) — — 10,398 (10,398 ) — Trade names 230 (230 ) — — 230 (192 ) 38 Patented technology 80 (80 ) — — 80 (80 ) — 24,183 (24,183 ) — — 24,183 (24,145 ) 38 Trade names 8,400 N/A — 8,400 8,400 N/A 8,400 Total intangible assets $ 32,583 $ (24,183 ) $ - $ 8,400 $ 32,583 $ (24,145 ) $ 8,438 (In thousands) Software development costs $ 67,541 $ (45,535 ) $ (22,006 ) $ - $ 67,541 $ (32,974 ) $ 34,567 Indefinite-lived intangible assets, comprised of our purchased trade name InfoGenesis™ as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 are tested for impairment upon identification of impairment indicators or at least annually. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than fair value. The InfoGenesis™ indefinite-lived purchased trade name impairment testing resulted in a fair value exceeding the carrying amount for the years ending March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Management compares the unamortized capitalized software development costs for each external use product to its net realizable value by analyzing critical inputs such as costs necessary to bring the software to market, costs necessary to maintain the software, life of the software, and market capacity. As of March 31, 2020, management determined the net realizable value of the remaining capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within out rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions which make it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the related rGuest solutions. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. The amount of impairment recognized during the period reduced the carry value of capitalized software development costs to zero with no remaining amortization expense to be recognized in future periods. Amortization expense related to software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $12.6 million, $12.6 million and $10.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These charges are included as Products cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization expense relating to other definite-lived intangible assets was $38,000 for the fiscal year end March 31, 2020 and $46,000 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. These charges are classified as operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Capitalized software development costs are carried on our balance sheets at net realizable value, net of accumulated amortization. We did not capitalize any software development costs during fiscal 2020. We capitalized approximately $2.0 million and $8.2 million during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. 52 6. Leases We adopted Topic 842 on April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption to recognize leases with a duration greater than 12 months on the balance sheet. The impact of adoption on April 1, 2019 was recognition of operating lease liabilities of $16.3 million and related Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets of $13.8 million. Prior period financial statements have not been restated and therefore the comparative amounts are not presented below or on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2019. For operating leases with a term greater than 12 months, we have recorded the lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term and the related ROU asset. The remaining lease term has been determined for each lease considering factors such as renewal options, termination options, our Company’s historical practices in exercising such options, and current business knowledge which may impact lease related decisions. The majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of office equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by, or associated with our active leases. Since our current leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, our incremental borrowing rates used to determine the value of lease payments in implementation are estimated as of April 1, 2019, based on collateralized rates for a term similar to each remaining lease term. We have elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which includes the ability to carryforward the previously determined lease classification (operating or finance), forgo the assessment whether active contracts contain a lease, and whether capitalized costs associated with a lease meet the definition of “initial direct costs” as defined within Topic 842. In the event that any of our leases contain nonlease components, we have elected the practical expedient to account for each separate lease component and the associated nonlease component(s) as a single lease component. We have also elected the accounting policy to forgo applying the guidance of Topic 842 to short term leases (defined as a term of 12 months or less, without a purchase option which we are reasonably certain to exercise). As of March 31, 2020, we do not have any leases which have not yet commenced. We do not have any related party leases or sublease arrangements. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable costs are expensed as incurred. The components of lease expenses for the fiscal 2020 period were as follows: Year Ended (in thousands) March 31, 2020 Operating leases expense $ 4,193 Finance lease expense: Amortization of ROU assets 23 Interest on lease liabilities 6 Total finance lease expense 29 Variable lease costs 271 Short term lease expense 88 Total lease expense $ 4,581 53 Other information related to leases for fiscal 2020 was as follows: Year Ended Supplemental cash flow information March 31, 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in thousands): Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 4,873 Operating cash flows for finance leases 8 Financing cash flows for finance leases 24 ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands): Operating leases $ 2,734 Finance leases 17 Weighted average remaining lease terms Operating leases 5.04 Finance leases 2.16 Weighted average discount rates Operating leases 10.37 % Finance leases 4.38 % The table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-cancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2020: Year ending (in thousands) Operating leases Finance leases 2021 $ 4,927 $ 29 2022 4,207 21 2023 2,855 5 2024 2,685 2 2025 2,083 — Thereafter 3,901 — Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments 20,658 57 Less: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease liabilities (5,322 ) (8 ) Total lease liabilities $ 15,336 $ 49 As previously disclosed on our March 31, 2019 Form 10-K and under the previous lease accounting standard, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases as of March 31, 2019 were as follows: Year ending (in thousands) Operating leases Finance leases 2020 $ 4,143 $ 27 2021 3,945 23 2022 3,166 15 2023 1,916 — 2024 1,770 — Thereafter 4,497 — Total lease payments 19,437 65 Less: Amounts representing interest — (8 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 19,437 $ 57 54 7 .

Our tax provision includes a provision for income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where subsidiaries are profitable, but only a minimal benefit is reflected related to U.S. and certain foreign tax losses due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of future benefits from these losses. The fiscal 2020 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax expense. The fiscal 2020 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. The fiscal 2019 tax provision primarily results from foreign tax expense, the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the completion of our accounting for the Tax Act. The fiscal 2019 effective rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, are as follows: (In thousands) 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Accrued liabilities $ 3,059 $ 3,944 Allowance for doubtful accounts 331 120 Inventory valuation reserve — 41 Federal losses and credit carryforwards 47,218 44,811 Foreign losses and credit carryforwards 1,523 1,146 State losses and credit carryforwards 10,911 9,886 Deferred revenue 582 488 Property and equipment and software amortization 163 — Operating lease liabilities 1,297 — Goodwill and other intangible assets 4,914 — Other 88 65 70,086 60,501 Less: valuation allowance (66,819 ) (57,852 ) Total 3,267 2,649 Deferred tax liabilities: Operating lease right-of-use assets (948 ) — Property and equipment and software amortization — (361 ) Goodwill and other intangible assets (2,426 ) (2,706 ) Other (9 ) — Total (3,383 ) (3,067 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ (116 ) $ (418 ) 56 At March 31, 20 20 , we had $ 19 9.1 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 203 1 to 203 8 , and $ 2 4.7 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. Our Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore subsidiaries have $0.4 million, $0.1 million, and $0. 3 million of net operating loss carryforwards , res pectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore can be carried forward indefinitely. At March 31, 20 20 , our India subsidiary had $0. 8 million of minimum alternative tax credits reported as other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance She et. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5 years of operations which includes fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022 . The India subsidiary is then subject to 50% of regular India income taxes during the second five years of operations which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027 . The aggregate value of the benefit of the SEZ during the current fisca l year is $0. 8 million. At March 31, 2020 we also had $141.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2021 through 2040. We recorded valuation allowances related to certain deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2020, the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $66.8 million was comprised of $65.9 million for federal and state deferred tax assets, and $0.9 million associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code. Because of our losses in current and prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes. The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $6.3 million and $3.1 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we will invest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign acquisitions and expansion. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable. We recorded a liability for unrecognized tax positions. The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the years ended March 31: (In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Balance at April 1 $ 580 $ 687 $ 988 Reductions: Relating to positions taken during prior year — — (300 ) Relating to lapse in statute (5 ) (107 ) (1 ) Balance at March 31 $ 575 $ 580 $ 687 As of March 31, 2020, we had a liability of $0.6 million related to uncertain tax positions, the recognition of which would affect our effective income tax rate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. We recognize interest accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $0.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, we had approximately $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of interest and penalties accrued in other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the U.S. we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five years. Although we have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open from 2006 forward due to attribute carryforwards. The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2013 forward in certain state jurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years. Years beginning after 2009 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities. 57 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CARES Act. The CARES Act includes provisions addressing the carryback of net operating losses for specific periods, refunds of alternative minimum tax credits, temporary modification to the limitation placed on the tax deductibility of net interest expenses, and technical amendments for qualified improvement property. Additionally, the CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022; the CARES Act also provides for certain employee retention tax credits. As of March 31, 2020, these provisions are expected to provide us with approximately $0.1 million of additional liquidity during the current year due to the ability to accelerate outstanding alternative minimum tax credit refunds. Due to the net loss position of the Company, we do not anticipate impacts from net loss carryback or deductibility provisions. We are currently deferring the employer-paid portion of social security taxes but do not currently anticipate qualifying for employee retention tax credits at this time. Separate from the CARES Act, the IRS extended the dates for estimated tax payments for the first and second calendar quarters of 2020 to July 15, 2020. Further, many states are offering similar deferrals of various classes of tax payments. Due to the net loss position of the Company, we do not anticipate material federal or state tax payment deferrals. Significant uncertainty exists regarding the magnitude and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, we cannot predict at this time the ultimate extent of its impact on our business operations, financial results and resulting effects to income taxes in future periods. See Part II, Item 1A. of this Annual Report for further discussion regarding risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 10. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans We maintain 401(k) plans for employees located in the United States meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, and we match 100% of the first 1% of the employee's pre-tax contributions and 50% of the next 5% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. We may also make discretionary contributions each year for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. Agilysys matching contributions were $1.8 million, $1.6 million, and $1.7 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We also maintain defined contribution retirement plans for employees located in the United Kingdom and in the Asia Pacific region in accordance with local statutory requirements and business practices. Defined Benefit Plan We maintain a defined benefit retirement plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees of our India subsidiary in accordance with local statutory requirements and business practices. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The Gratuity Plan is unfunded with obligation amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Employee benefit obligations” within “Other non-current liabilities.” Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agilysys provides certain former executives with life insurance benefits through endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the cash surrender value of $0.9 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiaries of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities."" Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies related to gains and losses incurred on these investments are classified within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a gain of $14,000, $15,000 and $17,000 in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, related to the corporate-owned life insurance policies. 58 1 1 . Commitments and Contingencies Legal Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. Most of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. Cases against us and our co-defendants remained pending in the District Court with respect to one surviving Ameranth patent. In September 2018, the District Court found that patent invalid, and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In early 2019, Ameranth appealed the District Court's summary judgment ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Shortly thereafter, Ameranth moved for a rehearing en banc, which was denied in February 2020. Finally, Ameranth filed for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has not yet responded to the writ. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or writ of certiorari may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 12. Loss per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing loss per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Year ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018 Numerator: Net loss $ (34,067 ) $ (13,164 ) $ (8,350 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 23,233 23,037 22,801 Loss per share - basic and diluted: Net loss per share-basic and diluted $ (1.47 ) $ (0.57 ) $ (0.37 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares and performance shares 1,510 1,433 756 Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 208,581, 300,437 and 334,817 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. In addition, when a net loss is reported, adjusting the denominator of diluted earnings per share would also be anti-dilutive to the loss per share, even if the entity has net income after adjusting for a discontinued operation. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 59 1 3 . Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) for up to 2.0 million common shares, plus 957,575 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is 1.25 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. For stock options and SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of stock option and SSAR awards is seven years from the date of grant. Stock option and SSARs awards vest over a period established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. SSARs may be granted in conjunction with, or independently from, stock option grants. SSARs granted in connection with a stock option are exercisable only to the extent that the stock option to which it relates is exercisable and the SSARs terminate upon the termination or exercise of the related stock option grants. Restricted shares and restricted share units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based awards may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted shares and restricted share units have the right to receive dividends, or dividend equivalents in the case of restricted share units, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying awards. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the 2016 Plan, for awards to employees, no performance-based restricted shares or restricted share units shall be based on a restriction period of less than one year, and any time-based restricted shares or restricted share units shall have a minimum restriction period of three years. We record compensation expense related to stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and SSAR awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. During fiscal year 2020, we issued 125,000 SSAR awards which are subject to a market condition. The fair value of these awards is estimated using the Lattice option pricing model which utilizes a binary tree and includes multiple assumptions which include volatility and life of the award to determine an appropriate fair value based on the award grant date. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: Year Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Product development 2,241 1,478 1,306 Sales and marketing 321 469 371 General and administrative 2,643 2,429 3,011 Total share-based compensation expense 5,205 4,376 4,688 Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled only in common shares of Agilysys. We use a Black-Scholes-Merton or a Lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of SSARs. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing SSARs granted in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: 2020 2019 2018 Risk-free interest rate 1.38%-1.74% 2.68 % 1.74%-1.94% Expected life (in years) 4.5-5 5 5 Expected volatility 31.7%-32.42% 32.42 % 32.42% - 32.84% Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 10.01 $ 4.72 $ 3.36 60 The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected life of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded vesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date. The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2020 for SSARs awarded under the 2016 and 2011 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted- Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 1,016,643 $ 11.22 Granted 691,364 34.72 Exercised (37,506 ) 10.02 Forfeited (15,838 ) 18.09 Cancelled/expired (9,775 ) 10.61 Outstanding at March 31, 2020 1,644,888 $ 21.07 4.9 $ 5,236 Exercisable at March 31, 2020 959,340 $ 11.79 3.9 $ 5,130 Vested and expected to vest at March 31, 2020 1,644,888 $ 21.07 4.9 $ 5,236 The following table presents additional information related to SSARs activity during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: (In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Compensation expense $ 1,666 $ 943 $ 1,869 Total intrinsic value of SSARs exercised $ 519 $ 907 $ 88 Total fair value of SSARs vesting $ 1,328 $ 1,165 $ 1,325 As of March 31, 2020, total unrecognized share based compensation expense related to non-vested SSARs was $5.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 2.3 years. A total of 21,494 shares, net of 6,712 shares withheld to cover the employee’s minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury shares to settle SSARs exercised during the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees under the 2016 and 2011 Plans, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 for restricted shares awarded under the 2016 and 2011 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 237,146 $ 13.46 Granted 223,404 22.72 Vested (231,677 ) 16.60 Forfeited (50,411 ) 17.34 Outstanding at March 31, 2020 178,462 $ 19.89 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. During fiscal 2020, a total of 208,151 shares, net of 46,656 shares withheld from the vested restricted shares to cover the employee's minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury. The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares. 61 The following table presents additional information related to restricted stock activity during fiscal years 20 20 , 20 19 , and 201 8 : (In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Compensation expense $ 3,385 $ 2,803 $ 2,594 Total fair value of restricted share vesting $ 4,004 $ 4,383 $ 4,315 As of March 31, 2020, total unrecognized share based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $2.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.9 years. We do not include restricted stock in the calculation of earnings per share until the shares are vested. Performance Shares The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2020 for performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 63,291 $ 14.22 Granted 30,120 22.41 Vested (23,526 ) 22.67 Forfeited (39,765 ) 14.22 Outstanding at March 31, 2020 30,120 $ 22.41 Based on the performance goals, management estimates a liability of $153,000 to be settled through the vesting of a variable number of the performance shares subsequent to March 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2020, total share based compensation expense related to performance shares has been fully recognized. The following table presents additional information related to performance share activity during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: (In thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Compensation expense $ 153 $ 630 $ 225 Total fair value of performance share vesting $ 513 $ 243 — Once attainment of the performance goals becomes probable, compensation expense related to performance share awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period based upon the closing market price of our common shares on the grant date. 14. Fair Value Measurements We estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. We assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy. The hierarchy indicates the extent to which pricing inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Level 1 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and are the most observable. Level 2 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities that are either directly or indirectly observable, or other observable inputs such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates, and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market and include our own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable and unobservable inputs is reflected in the hierarchy assessment disclosed in the tables below. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. The following tables present information about our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value: (In thousands) 31-Mar-20 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 936 — — $ 936 62 (In thousands) 31-Mar-19 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 895 — — $ 895 The recorded value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is adjusted to the cash surrender value of the policies obtained from the third party life insurance providers, which are not observable in the market, and therefore, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies are recorded within “Other expenses (income), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table presents a summary of changes in the fair value of the corporate-owned life insurance Level 3 asset for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019: March 31, March 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Corporate-owned life insurance: Balance on April 1 $ 895 $ 853 Unrealized gain relating to instruments held at reporting date 14 15 Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements, net 27 27 Balance on March 31 $ 936 $ 895 15. Quarterly Results (Unaudited) Because quarterly reporting of per share data is used independently for each reporting period, the sum of per share amounts for the four quarters in the fiscal year will not necessarily equal annual per share amounts. GAAP prohibits retroactive adjustment of quarterly per share amounts so that the sum of those amounts equals amounts for the full year. Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results.

Subsequent Events COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business as of and subsequent to our March 31, 2020 fiscal year-end as the travel and hospitality industries including our customers’ businesses suffered an abrupt and steep decline in activity due to property closures, cancelled voyages, cancelled sporting and entertainment events, and many other business operations curtailments. The change in the business environment for our customers resulted in project delays for our professional service teams, our inability to deliver products to closed property locations and a general reduction in sales activity. We have taken actions to mitigate the impact on our business. During the first quarter of our fiscal 2021, we have reduced discretionary costs, implemented a hiring freeze on non-essential positions and reduced payroll and related costs through layoffs, employee furloughs, employee retirement benefit limitations, and salary decreases for executive team members and certain other employees of the Company. The extent COVID-19 will impact our business including operations and financial results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Many factors will continue to influence the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on us including its ultimate severity, future government actions in response to COVID-19, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions return to levels before COVID-19. In May 2020, the Company announced a $35 million investment from MAK Capital One, LLC (“MAK Capital”), a leading investment management firm who has been a major shareholder of the Company since 2007. MAK Capital will purchase $35 million of convertible preferred stock carrying a 5.25% dividend that will be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $20.1676 per share. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is anticipated to finalize during May 2020. The close of the transaction will add $35 million in preferred stock to the Company’s balance sheet and increase our cash balance by the $35 million investment less estimated closing costs of approximately $1 million. 17.

Change in and Disagreements With Accou ntants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Agilysys, under the supervision of the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision of our CEO and CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation, management concluded that Agilysys maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020. Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued their report regarding Agilysys' internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, which is included elsewhere in this annual report. Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our workforce began working remotely in March 2020. Our established internal controls continued to operate as they have historically, and the change in the work environment for our employees did not have a material adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Item 9B. Other Information None. 65 Part III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. Information required by this Item as to the Directors of Agilysys, Executive Officers, the Audit Committee, Agilysys' Code of Business Conduct, and the procedures by which shareholders may recommend nominations appearing under the headings “Election of Directors,” “Executive Officers” and “Corporate Governance” in our Proxy Statement to be used in connection with Agilysys' 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “ 2020 Proxy Statement”) is incorporated herein by reference. Information with respect to compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by our Directors, executive officers, and holders of more than five percent of Agilysys' equity securities will be set forth in the 2020 Proxy Statement under the heading “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.” We adopted a Code of Business Conduct that applies to all Directors and employees of Agilysys, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

Business. Overview Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive solutions in the industry, including point of sale (POS), property management systems (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the entire guest journey. Agilysys is known for its leadership in hospitality, its broad product offerings and its customer-centric service. Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. For more information, visit www.agilysys.com. Our principal executive offices and corporate services are located at 1000 Windward Concourse, Suite 250, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30005. Reference herein to any particular year or quarter refers to periods within our fiscal year ended March 31. For example, fiscal 2019 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. History and Significant Events Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc. In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for property and inventory management in the casino and resort industries. In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. In fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining operating units. In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market. In fiscal 2018, we opened a development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts. Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their respective brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase speed and accuracy, integrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship. 4 Table of Contents Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from ongoing support and maintenance agreements, subscription services, cloud applications and professional services. Products, Support and Professional Services We are a leading developer and marketer of software enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including: software solutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; support, maintenance and subscription services; and, professional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core solutions. We present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories: • Products (hardware and software) • Support, maintenance and subscription services • Professional services Total revenue for these three specific areas is as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Products $ 39,003 $ 33,699 $ 38,339 Support, maintenance and subscription services 75,496 69,068 63,308 Professional services 26,343 24,593 26,031 Total $ 140,842 $ 127,360 $ 127,678 Products: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems. Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions' ability to help our customer meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases. Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting these offerings while market demand for maintenance services and updates that enhance reliability, as well as the desire for flexibility in purchasing options, continue to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud. Professional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive experience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money. Our portfolio of hospitality software solutions: The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated ""platform-centric” solutions for Lodging and Food & Beverage including the applications necessary to support this ecosystem. 5 Table of Contents Our technology platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests before, during and post-visit. We offer an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve the guest experience, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our focus is to help hospitality operators recruit and retain customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest and improve the overall experience throughout the entire guest journey - from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions. Point of Sale (POS) Solutions: Agilysys POS solution suite allows our customers to provide their guests with an omni-channel experience within their property. Guests are empowered to create their own experiences through ordering from a mobile device or walking up to a self-service kiosk, but also providing for a more traditional experience with staff by walking to a cashier, bar or having a server come to them. Irrespective of the channel of interaction for the guest, our POS suite provides a single integrated enterprise grade back office management system with robust reporting capabilities. This allows our customers to manage menus, price changes, purchasing trends, inventory management and sales reporting from a single integrated source providing for increased efficiency as well as providing a richer guest profile. Agilysys InfoGenesis® POS is an award-winning point of sale solution that combines a fast, intuitive and highly customizable terminal application with powerful, flexible reporting and configuration capabilities in the back office management portal. The system is easy to set up, and its scalable architecture enables customers to add workstations without having to build out expensive infrastructure.

Engineered for all regions of the world, the Agilysys POS solution suite offers a multinational set of features, including language, currency and fiscal technology, coupled with a robust enterprise management capability enabling the largest global customers to run their business efficiently. With a modern integration platform of APIs, the solution is also capable of integrating with a variety of ancillary applications allowing our customers to keep their entire technology estate. InfoGenesis POS is available as a cloud-based or on-premise solution. Agilysys InfoGenesis Flex is a mobility solution that offers full point of sale functionality on a Windows tablet in 6, 8, or 10"" form factors. It provides a sleek, modern alternative to traditional point of sale installations and can be used as a slim fixed terminal or as a convertible mobile POS simply by removing the tablet from its base. Agilysys InfoGenesis KDS is a digital kitchen management solution that integrates with InfoGenesis, rGuest Buy® Kiosk and rGuest Buy OnDemand to deliver staff and customer originated orders to the kitchen for preparation. Custom attributes such as guest phone number, name, guest location or packaging instructions can be provided on each incoming order so the order can be fulfilled promptly to guests. Guests can optionally be notified of order completion via an order status monitor (OSM) or via text message. rGuest Buy Kiosk is an enterprise-class self-service, customer-facing point of sale solution for the hospitality industry. It is ideal for food & beverage venues such as buffets, grab 'n go, corporate cafeterias and food courts.

The self-service components reduce on-site labor needed to manage venue operations, while improving guest throughput, check size, order accuracy, guest experience and satisfaction. The platform-driven and cloud-based solution allows for easy deployments and management at scale resulting in a lowered overall cost of ownership. 6 Table of Contents rGuest Buy OnDemand provides a visual, interactive F&B ordering experience to any mobile device - phone, tablet, laptop - with a browser- based self-service experience. Using a simple, intuitive interface, guests can easily order and reorder from anywhere across the property, driving order velocity and volume. Property Management Systems (PMS): Agilysys offers the most comprehensive suite of property management applications to serve the needs of our integrated resort and hospitality customers. Our platforms enable our customers to provide a seamless experience to their guests while driving operational efficiencies throughout the value chain. Our PMS suite of applications consists of the core property management system, a commission free booking engine, self-service check in and check out solutions, spa, golf, retail, accounting, sales and catering, service request optimization and condo management applications. Agilysys Lodging Management System® (LMS™) is an on-premise or hosted, web and mobile-enabled, PMS solution targeting the operator with large, complex operations. It runs 24/7 to automate every aspect of hotel operations in properties from 100 to over 7,000 rooms, and has interfaces to a wide array of industry applications including but not limited to all core casino management systems and leading global distribution systems (GDSs).

The guest-centric PMS leverages the rGuest standards-based platform on an open architecture with public APIs to enable richly integrated applications delivered from Agilysys, its partners and customers. rGuest Stay offers powerful capabilities for multi-property operations, allowing managers to view guest profiles, history and reservations, as well as room availability and operational reports, seamlessly across multiple properties. Focused on improving revenue and streamlining operations, rGuest Stay is designed to enable hotels to gather and analyze guest information across properties that can be used to create loyalty-generating offers and increase guest wallet share. In addition, running natively in a browser on both desktop and tablet devices, it delivers real-time operating metrics so that hotels can more accurately forecast demand and scale guest services accordingly. Flexible Check-in and Check-out Solutions Today’s hotels cater to guests with high expectations when it comes to technological efficiency. An emerging trend in the hotel industry is the ability for guests to check themselves in or out of their room without the inconvenience of stopping by the front desk. To that end, we offer software modules that enable just this and are fully integrated with our core PMS solutions. rGuest Express Kiosk simplifies check-in and check-out, optimizes staff productivity and enhances the guest experience by enabling a seamless self-service option for guests to use in the hotel lobby at a kiosk. More properties are turning to kiosks to reduce overhead and offer more self-service options. With rGuest Express Kiosk, it’s easy to elevate service levels without adding front-line staff. 7 Table of Contents rGuest Express Mobile simplifies check-in and check-out even further and at the same time allows operators to offer mobile keys, concurrent dining reservations or room upsells, all on a personal mobile device such as a smart phone or tablet. Properties are turning to mobility at an ever-increasing pace to improve efficiency. With rGuest Express Mobile, it’s easy reduce wait times and empower guests by putting the power of choice in the palm of their hand. Point of Sale and Property Management Ecosystem Offerings: The following solutions integrate with and are complementary to our point of sale or property management systems, or both. These solutions, for the most part, can stand alone and don’t require POS or PMS to be functional. However, we lead with our core POS and PMS solutions discussed above and focus on selling these complimentary ecosystem solutions into our customer base. rGuest® Pay payment processing solution is our innovative payments gateway. rGuest Pay protects guests’ financial data and reduces risk by leveraging point-to-point encryption (P2PE) and tokenization with every credit card transaction. rGuest Pay Gateway leverages one of the first payment gateways in the world to receive official PCI-P2PE validation, allowing us to offer PCI cost and scope reduction that other providers cannot. These security benefits are built on top of a full-featured, enterprise-grade gateway that offers broad support for U.S., Canada, and European credit card processors and a wide variety of payment device options for every use-case, including countertop, pay-at-table, EMV, mobile tablet, and signature capture scenarios. rGuest Spa software covers all aspects of running a spa, from scheduling guests for services to managing staff schedules. With this guest-centric technology, spas have more time to focus on creating personalized experiences in places of quiet tranquility, an increasingly scarce resource. rGuest Spa is a single solution that connects effortlessly to our other software solutions. The solution includes real-time integration, simplifies the appointment booking process, enhances the guest experience, and maximizes the value of the spa as a revenue center. GolfPro is a module that offers golf property managers complete pro shop management with tee time scheduling, member profile/billing, tournament management and Web and e-mail access bundled into one solution.

We operate across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. The hotel and resort market sector remains strong and continues to expand with record-setting occupancy for US hotels 3 years in a row according to the 2019 Lodging Technology Study. Occupancy rates increased to 66.4% in 2018 which is up from 65.9% in 2017. Revenue per available room (RevPar) has increased at least 3% eight years in a row and CPA firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts RevPar will increase by 2.6% in 2019. Along with the current expansion of the hotel revenue, IT Budgets for Hoteliers increased by 15% in 2018 and are expected to continue to increase by similar amounts in 2019. Overall technology spend has increased on a percentage of revenue basis from 3.5% in 2016 to 4.6% of revenue in 2018. Of the technology spend as a percentage of revenue, our products nearly 40% of these items or about 1.7% of the 2018 hotel revenues. We have a significant customer base in the commercial casino and gaming sector. According to CPA firm Rubin Brown's Gaming Services Group, U.S. Gaming industry annual revenues grew to nearly $79 billion in 2018, as compared to approximately $76 billion in 2017 and $73 billion in 2016. Amenities in contemporary casinos extend well beyond gaming to include a variety of entertainment and leisure options as well as modern convention centers and meeting facilities to attract the corporate market. International gaming markets are growing rapidly both in size and new jurisdictions. Asian gaming markets continue to generate robust growth. Gross gaming revenue in Macau exceeds that of the Las Vegas Strip, with a number of the current and planned properties in the region operated by U.S.-based companies. As the market share leader in providing POS and PMS to casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, we are well positioned to benefit from these strong and long-standing relationships as our customer base expands into international markets. Additionally, as gaming operators migrate toward cashless operations, optimization of non-gaming spend and digital track-and-log of unique guest behavior, we are able to provide the requisite technologies and expertise to satisfy their needs. Between the hotel and resort sector and the gaming sector we currently serve approximately 271,000 rooms out of a possible market of 17.5 million rooms worldwide. 10 Table of Contents The food service management (FSM) sector services restaurants in corporate cafes, airports, healthcare facilities, universities, stadiums and arenas. The industry employs around 700,000 individuals and continues to expand. According to the IBIS World Industry Report, labor and wages have reduced in the sector as a percentage of revenue over the past 5 years as operators continue to look for overall labor efficiency improvements. The FSM sector has a focus on faster line time, food cost optimization and reducing costs. IBISWorld expects the FSM industry revenue to increase from nearly $48 billion to nearly $53 billion over the next five years. The healthcare division continues to expand with an aging population increasing their need for large cafeterias in their facilities. The Sports and Entertainment (S&E) division has continued to grow over the last five years as sporting event attendance has been on the incline. The S&E sector is very sensitive to customer spending patterns, driven by quality and range of food service. Our technologies position us well in the FSM sector to support their cost and revenue initiatives in these high volume environments. We also have expertise in serving the unique needs of Cruise ship operators. Guests and potential guests are expecting an experience that reflects their unique tastes, preferences and travel habits, and cruise operators have seen the need to adequately support the increasing level of personalization and detail required to capture the highest level of guest satisfaction. Our products and services are designed to best help them deliver on this critical part of their business. According to the Cruise Lines International Association and Cruise Market Watch 2018 , cruise lines continued the growth trends of recent years in 2018. The worldwide cruise ship fleet currently stands at 314 ships and the current order book includes 18 new ships to be delivered by 2019. The industry carried an estimated 26.0 million passengers in 2018, up from nearly 25.2 million passengers in 2017. Customers Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique companies, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important, particularly in the lodging, casino, destination resort, cruise line, foodservice industries where competition for guest recruitment is intense. During fiscal 2017, we had one customer representing 10% of consolidated revenue for the year due to a large scale project. Otherwise, our customer base is highly fragmented. Seasonality Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results. Competition Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., NCR, Constellation Software, Inc., Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with software companies like POSitouch, Northwind and Appetize Technologies. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains. Environmental Matters We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations. Employees As of March 31, 2019 , we had 936 employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, have had no strikes or work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.

Risk Factors. Risks Relating to Our Business Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance. Our business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we will need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer's needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. The development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including: • Managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements, which has frequently been longer than we originally expected; • Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers; and • Extending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products, such as mobile devices. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. If we fail to meet our customers' performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal liability. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high quality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our services or solutions, our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers' performance expectations, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure adversely impacts our customers' businesses. In addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers' businesses. While our contracts typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for errors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability. We face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services. Several companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future. 12 Table of Contents We compete for customers based on several factors, including price. In some cases, we may have to reduce our pricing to obtain business. If we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our products and services, our profit margin and our profitability could suffer. Cloud-based platform and software applications presents increased security risks. As we expand our cloud-based platform and software hosting capabilities, including our rGuest products, and offer more of our software applications to our customers on a cloud-based basis, our responsibility for data and system security with respect to data held in our hosting centers increases significantly. While we believe that our current platform, software applications and data centers comply with applicable laws and industry security requirements, and while we believe that we use appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of unauthorized access or misuse of data in the data centers, we cannot provide absolute assurance that our cloud-based applications will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access can be prevented. If a security breach were to occur, a customer, regulatory agency, or other person could seek redress from us, which could adversely affect our business. Our cloud-based solutions present execution and competitive risks. Our solutions offered in the cloud accessible via the web present new and difficult technology challenges. These offerings depend on integration of third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors working together with our products. As a result, we may be subject to claims if customers experience service disruptions, breaches or other quality issues related to our cloud-based solutions. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities. Our software may be used in connection with processing sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the customer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our support and other systems, we cannot assure that our customers' systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access can be prevented. If a customer, or other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach, our business could be adversely affected. If we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits. As part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects. We may incur goodwill, intangible asset and capitalized software development impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results. As of March 31, 2019 we had $19.6 million , $8.4 million , and $34.6 million of goodwill, intangible assets, net, and software development costs, net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We review our goodwill, intangible assets and capitalized software development costs for impairment on at least an annual basis. Our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets or capitalized software development costs in the future. If we fail to attract and retain key employees, our business may be harmed. Our success depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employees. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable personnel, especially in product development, customer services and support, operations, sales and management, our business and financial results may suffer. For example, if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled technical personnel, our ability to develop high quality products and provide high quality customer service may be impaired. Experienced and capable personnel in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. When talented employees leave, we may have difficulty replacing them, and our business may suffer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain the personnel that we need. 13 Table of Contents We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. While we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. This lawsuit remains pending. This lawsuit and any other such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are found liable, we could be obligated to pay significant damages or enter into license agreements. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. We have encountered risks associated with maintaining large cash balances. While we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments generally considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts, if any. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Some of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in “Accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to litigation, which may be costly. As a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such litigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse effect on our business. Our dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them. We rely on a concentrated number of vendors for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs. We do not have long term agreements with many of these vendors. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services needs from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner programs, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it may have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins. 14 Table of Contents Risks Relating to the Industries We Serve Our business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and a weakening could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Because our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business is largely dependent on the health of that industry. Our sales are dependent in large part on the health of the hospitality industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality industry could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. Higher oil and gas prices worldwide could have a material adverse impact on the hospitality industry, and indirectly, on our business. Material increases in oil and gas prices tend to reduce discretionary spending by consumers, such as on travel and dining, as well as on retail spending generally. Reductions in discretionary spending by consumers adversely affects our customers and, indirectly, our business. Moreover, increases in oil and gas prices also directly adversely affects our customer base in other ways. For example, oil and gas price increases can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our restaurant customers. Consolidation in the casino and hospitality industry could adversely affect our business. Customers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and casino sectors of the industry. Although recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance that future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider's products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services from us, which could have an adverse effect our business. Risks Relating to Our Stock Our stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. Our stock price has been volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended March 31, 2019 , the trading price of our common stock ranged from a high close of $21.17 to a low close of $11.78. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include: • economic news or other events generally affecting the trading markets; • our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of securities analysts to publish reports about us or our business; • announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments; • our ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis; • any major change in our board or management; general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism. Additionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the volatility of our common share price over time. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our corporate headquarters are located in Alpharetta, Georgia where we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space. In addition, we lease approximately 33,000 square feet of office space in Las Vegas, Nevada, 12,000 square feet of office space in Bellevue, Washington, 12,000 square feet of office space in Santa Barbara, California, and 6,000 square feet of warehouse space in Roswell, Georgia. Internationally, we lease approximately 70,000 square feet of office space in Chennai, India and lease several other smaller office locations throughout Europe and Asia. Our major leases contain renewal options for periods of up to 10 years. We believe that our current facilities and office space are sufficient to meet our needs and do not anticipate any difficulty securing additional space as needed. 15 Table of Contents Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are involved in legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of any current pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. Most of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. Cases against us and our co-defendants remained pending in the District Court with respect to one surviving Ameranth patent. In September 2018, the District Court found that patent invalid, and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In early 2019, Ameranth appealed the District Court's summary judgment ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We are not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or appeal may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys’ fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the remaining claims in the lawsuit, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 16 Table of Contents Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Our common shares, without par value, are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol “AGYS”. The high and low sales prices for the common shares for each quarter during the past two fiscal years are presented in the table below. 2019 High Low Fourth quarter $ 21.17 $ 13.92 Third quarter $ 17.02 $ 13.88 Second quarter $ 16.72 $ 14.72 First quarter $ 15.55 $ 11.78 2018 High Low Fourth quarter $ 13.00 $ 10.77 Third quarter $ 12.98 $ 11.30 Second quarter $ 12.14 $ 9.80 First quarter $ 10.30 $ 9.08 The closing price of the common shares on May 21, 2019, was $22.51 per share. There were 1,561 active shareholders of record. We did not pay dividends in fiscal 2019 or 2018 and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future. The current policy of the Board of Directors is to retain any available earnings for use in the operations of our business. 17 Shareholder Return Performance Presentation The following chart compares the value of $100 invested in our common shares, including reinvestment of dividends, with a similar investment in the Russell 2000 Index (the “Russell 2000”) and with the companies listed in the SIC Code 7373-Computer Integrated Systems Design for the period March 31, 2014 through March 31, 2019.

Selected Financial Data. The following selected consolidated financial and operating data was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, and Item 7 contained in Part II of this Annual Report. Year ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Operating results Net revenue $ 140,842 $ 127,360 $ 127,678 $ 120,366 $ 103,514 Gross profit 73,880 64,417 63,785 68,106 60,081 Operating loss (13,081 ) (12,080 ) (11,408 ) (4,313 ) (12,467 ) Operating loss, net of taxes (13,164 ) (8,350 ) (11,721 ) (3,765 ) (11,497 ) Net loss $ (13,164 ) $ (8,350 ) $ (11,721 ) $ (3,765 ) $ (11,497 ) Per share data (1) Basic and diluted Net loss $ (0.57 ) $ (0.37 ) $ (0.52 ) $ (0.17 ) $ (0.51 ) Weighted-average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 23,037 22,801 22,615 22,483 22,338 Balance sheet data at year end Cash and cash equivalents $ 40,771 $ 39,943 $ 49,255 $ 60,608 $ 75,067 Working capital 20,707 19,343 27,183 41,401 54,407 Total assets 163,591 157,207 167,305 185,157 181,525 Total debt 57 177 237 333 189 Total shareholders’ equity 100,622 108,431 113,669 123,473 124,188 (1) When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. In addition, when a loss from continuing operations is reported, adjusting the denominator of diluted earnings per share would also be anti-dilutive to the loss per share, even if the entity has net income after adjusting for a discontinued operation. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 19 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue – We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances. • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. Results of Operations Fiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 : Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 39,003 $ 33,699 $ 5,304 15.7 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 75,496 69,068 6,428 9.3 % Professional services 26,343 24,593 1,750 7.1 % Total net revenue 140,842 127,360 13,482 10.6 % Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 31,811 26,381 5,430 20.6 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 15,895 16,688 (793 ) (4.8 )% Professional services 19,256 19,874 (618 ) (3.1 )% Total cost of goods sold 66,962 62,943 4,019 6.4 % Gross profit 73,880 64,417 9,463 14.7 % Gross profit margin 52.5 % 50.6 % Operating expenses: Product development 37,817 27,936 9,881 35.4 % Sales and marketing 19,646 18,075 1,571 8.7 % General and administrative 23,118 24,028 (910 ) (3.8 )% Depreciation of fixed assets 2,504 2,631 (127 ) (4.8 )% Amortization of intangibles 2,567 1,879 688 36.6 % Restructuring, severance and other charges 1,168 1,798 (630 ) (35.0 )% Legal settlements 141 150 (9 ) (6.0 )% Operating loss $ (13,081 ) $ (12,080 ) $ (1,001 ) 8.3 % Operating loss percentage (9.3 )% (9.5 )% 21 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2019 2018 Net revenue: Products 27.7 % 26.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 53.6 54.2 Professional services 18.7 19.3 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold: Products, inclusive of developed technology amortization 22.6 20.7 Support, maintenance and subscription services 11.3 13.1 Professional services 13.6 15.6 Total net cost of goods sold 47.5 49.4 Gross profit 52.5 50.6 Operating expenses: Product development 26.9 21.9 Sales and marketing 13.9 14.2 General and administrative 16.4 18.9 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.8 2.1 Amortization of intangibles 1.8 1.5 Restructuring, severance and other charges 0.8 1.4 Legal settlements 0.1 0.1 Operating loss (9.3 )% (9.5 )% Net revenue. Total revenue increased $13.5 million , or 10.6% , in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 . Products revenue increased $5.3 million , or 15.7% , due to growth in third-party hardware sales and in on premise software sales, which grew more than 20% compared to the prior year. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $6.4 million , or 9.3% , driven by growth in customers using our on premise software products that require the payment of support and maintenance along with continued increases in subscription based revenue, which increased 23.5% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Subscription based revenue comprised 17.7% of total consolidated revenues in 2019 compared to 15.8% in 2018. Professional services revenue increased $1.8 million , or 7.1% , as a result of growth in our customer base including installations of our traditional on premise and subscription based software solutions and increased responses to customer service requests. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $9.5 million , or 14.7% , in fiscal 2019 and total gross profit margin increased from 50.6% to 52.5% . Products gross profit decreased $0.1 million and gross profit margin decreased 3.3% to 18.4% primarily as a result of increased developed technology amortization. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $7.2 million and gross profit margin increased 310 basis points to 78.9% due to the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit increased $2.4 million and gross profit margin increased 7.7% to 26.9% due to increased revenue with lower costs from the restructuring of our professional services workforce during the first quarter of 2018 into a more efficient operating structure with limited use of contract labor. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements and restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $10.5 million, or 13.7%, in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 . As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have increased 2.3% in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 . Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development increased $9.9 million , or 35.4% , during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the reduction of cost capitalization. The products in our rGuest platform for which we had capitalized costs reached general availability by the beginning of the second 22 Table of Contents quarter of fiscal 2019. These products join our well established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. We capitalized $2.0 million of external use software development costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs during fiscal 2019, with the full balance capitalized in Q1 fiscal 2019. We capitalized approximately $8.9 million in total development costs during fiscal 2018. Total product development costs, including operating expenses and capitalized amounts, were $40.1 million during fiscal 2019 compared to $38.4 million in fiscal 2018. The $1.7 million increase is mostly due to continued expansion of our R&D teams and increased compensation expense as a result of bonus earnings. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $1.6 million , or 8.7% , in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 . The change is due primarily to an increase of $1.6 million in incentive compensation related to an increase in sales, revenue and profitability during fiscal 2019. General and administrative. General and administrative decreased $0.9 million , or 3.8% , in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 . The change is due primarily to reduced outside professional costs for legal and accounting services. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $0.1 million or 5% in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 . Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles increased $0.7 million , or 36.6% , in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 due to our remaining rGuest suite of products being placed into service on June 30, 2018. Restructuring, severance and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges decreased $1.8 million due to non-recurring 2018 restructuring activities while charges for non-restructuring severance increased $1.2 million , resulting in a net decrease of $0.6 million during fiscal 2019. Our restructuring actions are discussed further in Note 4, Restructuring Charges . Legal settlements. Legal settlements consist of settlements of employment and other business-related matters.

Interest income consists of interest earned on short-term investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and corporate-owned life insurance policies. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with capital leases. Other (income) expense, net. Other (income) expense, net consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Year ended March 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Income tax expense (benefit) $ 221 $ (3,251 ) $ (3,472 ) nm Effective tax rate (1.7 )% 28.0 % nm - not meaningful For fiscal 2019, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. 23 Table of Contents The 2018 tax provision results primarily from a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act""). The 2018 effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the impact of the Tax Act, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. At March 31, 2019, we had $210.6 million of a federal net operating loss carryforwards of which $199.1 million will expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 : Year ended March 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 33,699 $ 38,339 $ (4,640 ) (12.1 )% Support, maintenance and subscription services 69,068 63,308 5,760 9.1 % Professional services 24,593 26,031 (1,438 ) (5.5 )% Total net revenue 127,360 127,678 (318 ) (0.2 )% Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 26,381 28,244 (1,863 ) (6.6 )% Support, maintenance and subscription services 16,688 16,965 (277 ) (1.6 )% Professional services 19,874 18,684 1,190 6.4 % Total cost of goods sold 62,943 63,893 (950 ) (1.5 )% Gross profit 64,417 63,785 632 1.0 % Gross profit margin 50.6 % 50.0 % Operating expenses: Product development 27,936 29,048 (1,112 ) (3.8 )% Sales and marketing 18,075 20,823 (2,748 ) (13.2 )% General and administrative 24,028 19,875 4,153 20.9 % Depreciation of fixed assets 2,631 2,409 222 9.2 % Amortization of intangibles 1,879 1,392 487 35.0 % Restructuring, severance and other charges 1,798 1,561 237 15.2 % Legal settlements 150 85 65 76.5 % Operating loss $ (12,080 ) $ (11,408 ) $ (672 ) 5.9 % Operating loss percentage (9.5 )% (8.9 )% nm - not meaningful 24 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Year ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net revenue: Products 26.5 % 30.0 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 54.2 49.6 Professional services 19.3 20.4 Total net revenue 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 20.7 22.1 Support, maintenance and subscription services 13.1 13.3 Professional services 15.6 14.6 Total cost of goods sold 49.4 50.0 Gross profit 50.6 50.0 Operating expenses: Product development 21.9 22.8 Sales and marketing 14.2 16.3 General and administrative 18.9 15.6 Depreciation of fixed assets 2.1 1.9 Amortization of intangibles 1.5 1.1 Restructuring, severance and other charges 1.4 1.2 Legal settlements 0.1 0.1 Operating loss (9.5 )% (8.9 )% Net revenue. Total revenue decreased $0.3 million, or 0.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Products revenue decreased $4.6 million or 12.1% while support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased 5.8 million, or 9.1%, as a result of continued focus on selling hosted perpetual and subscription services which increased 35% year over year. Hosted perpetual and subscription services revenue comprised 16% of total consolidated revenues in 2018 compared to 12% in 2017. Professional services revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 5.5%, primarily as a result of a decrease in proprietary services of $1.5 million offset by an increase in remarketed services of $0.1 million. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $0.6 million, or 1.0%, in fiscal 2018 and total gross profit margin increased 0.6% to 50.6%. Products gross profit decreased $2.8 million and gross profit margin decreased 4.6% to 21.7% primarily as a result of lower product revenue coupled with higher amortization of developed technology by $2.0 million related to the previously announced general availability of the latest version of our rGuest Buy and rGuest Stay software that were placed into service in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, and the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $6.0 million and gross profit margin increased 260 basis points to 75.8% due to the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit decreased $2.6 million and gross profit margin decreased 9.0% to 19.2% due to lower professional services revenues on higher cost structure following a recent alignment toward enabling the Company to provide more customer-centric services going forward. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements and restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $1.0 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. As a percent of total revenue, operating expenses have increased 0.9% in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Product development. Product development includes all expenses associated with research and development. Product development decreased $1.1 million, or 3.8%, during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. This decrease is primarily driven by our shift from contract labor to internal resources resulting in a decrease in contract labor of $5.9 million and an increase in payroll related expenses of $4.7 million. 25 Table of Contents Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $2.7 million, or 13.2%, in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The change is due primarily to a decrease of $2.2 million in incentive commissions related to revision of our commission plan from total contract value to annual contract value coupled with lower sales in fiscal 2018. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $4.2 million, or 20.9%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The change is due primarily to increases of $2.5 million in stock compensation expense related to executive stock grants and the impact of removing forfeiture rates as a result of adopting ASU No. 2016-09, coupled with forfeitures in the prior year due to the departure of former executives. In addition, there was an increase of $1.6 million in payroll related expenses as a result of additional headcount including new hires throughout our operating locations. Depreciation of fixed assets. Depreciation of fixed assets increased $0.2 million or 9.2% in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles increased $0.5 million, or 35.0%, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 due to our latest version of rGuest Pay being placed into service on March 31, 2017. Restructuring, severance and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges increased $0.2 million during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 related to our ongoing efforts to create more efficient teams across the business, which included certain executive changes during the year. Our restructuring actions are discussed further in Note 4, Restructuring Charges . Legal settlements. During fiscal 2018 and 2017, we recorded $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in legal settlements for employment and other business-related matters.

The Company recorded a benefit of approximately $3.3 million resulting from the effect of a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. At March 31, 2018, we had $198.7 million of a federal net operating loss carryforward that expires, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038. 26 Table of Contents For fiscal 2017, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the range of zero to $0.1 million of tax and zero to $0.2 million of interest based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated prior to Tax Act reform depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease and rental obligations at March 31, 2019 . We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $40.8 million as of March 31, 2019 , and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements. As of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 , our total debt was approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million , respectively, comprised of capital lease obligations in both periods. At March 31, 2019 , 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 94% is located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments with original maturity from date of acquisition of three months or less, including investments in commercial paper. Therefore, we believe that credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash Flow Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 7,241 $ 6,874 $ 3,433 Investing activities (5,534 ) (15,085 ) (13,865 ) Financing activities (767 ) (1,295 ) (847 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (112 ) 194 (74 ) Cash flows provided by (used in) operations $ 828 $ (9,312 ) $ (11,353 ) Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $7.2 million in fiscal 2019 . The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $13.2 million adjusted for $22.4 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation and an increase of approximately $2 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $6.9 million in fiscal 2018 . The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $12.1 million adjusted for $19.2 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.4 million in fiscal 2017 . The provision of cash included $6.4 million in increased collections on accounts receivable. Cash flow used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 were $5.5 million . This is primarily attributed to $2.2 million in development of proprietary software and $3.3 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. 27 Table of Contents Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2018 were $15.1 million . This is primarily attributed to $8.9 million in development of proprietary software and $6.1 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 were $13.9 million . This is primarily attributed to $11.9 million in development of proprietary software and $4.2 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software offset by $2.2 million in proceeds from corporate owned life insurance policies. Cash flow used in financing activities. Respectively, in fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , the $0.8 million , $1.3 million , and $0.8 million cash flows used in financing activities were primarily comprised of the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding and to cover the exercise price of the options, and payments on capital lease obligations. Investments Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies for certain former executives, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into non-cancelable agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $0.9 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiary of $0.1 million, which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities"" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Contractual Obligations The following table provides aggregate information regarding our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019 . (In thousands) Total 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 Thereafter Operating leases (1) $ 19,437 $ 4,143 $ 7,111 $ 3,686 $ 4,497 Capital leases 65 27 38 — — Asset retirement obligation 400 — 150 250 Total contractual obligations (2) $ 19,902 $ 4,170 $ 7,299 $ 3,936 $ 4,497 (1) Operating lease obligations are presented net of contractually binding sub-lease arrangements. Additional information regarding our operating lease obligations is contained in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies. (2) At March 31, 2019, we had a $1.1 million liability reserve for unrecognized income tax positions which is not reflected in the table above. The timing of potential cash outflows related to the unrecognized tax positions is not reasonably determinable and therefore, is not scheduled. Substantially all of this reserve is included in Other non-current liabilities. Additional information regarding unrecognized tax positions is provided in Note 10, Income Taxes. We believe that cash on hand, funds from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to finance capital spending and working capital needs and to service our obligations and other commitments arising during the foreseeable future. 28 Critical Accounting Policies MD&A is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale, purchase, and promotion of our products and services. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after the adoption date are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under prior guidance. Revenue recognition under Topic 606 Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. A majority of our hardware sales involve shipment directly from its suppliers to the end-user customers. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor as we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. Each of these performance obligations provide benefit to the customer on a standalone basis and are distinct in the context of the contract. Each of these distinct performance obligations represent a stand ready obligation to provide service to a customer, which is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer, which is why we account for these support services as a single performance obligation, recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not 29 considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. Typically, we invoice fees monthly. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We estimate standalone selling price (""SSP"") based on the price at which the performance obligations are sold by considering certain specific factors related to our company together with customer information. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk, as well as historic trends of the entire customer pool. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. To mitigate this credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. Inventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, net of related reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or market, if necessary, are based upon contractual provisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. Income Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We recorded a valuation allowance of $57.9 million as of March 31, 2019 and $54.3 million as of March 31, 2018, related to substantially all of our deferred income tax assets in jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of a benefit from those assets. In the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the tax valuation allowance would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 10, Income Taxes . Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist. The Company is also required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying 30 amounts at least annually, or when current events and circumstances require an interim assessment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, certain restructuring activities incurred to better align product development, sales and marketing and general and administrative functions impacted the expected remaining useful life of the products under the Eatec® trade name. The trade name was determined to have a finite life and subsequently written down to its fair value to be amortized over five years. The remaining indefinite-lived intangible asset is not amortized; rather, it is tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the fair value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than fair value. Additional information regarding our intangible assets is provided in Note 6, Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs . Restructuring Charges. We recognize restructuring charges when a plan that materially changes the scope of our business, or the manner in which that business is conducted, is adopted and communicated to the impacted parties, and the expenses have been incurred or are reasonably estimable. Our restructuring reserves principally include estimates related to employee separation costs and the consolidation and impairment of facilities that will no longer be used in continuing operations. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. Facility reserves are calculated using a present value of future minimum lease payments, offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers. Present value is calculated using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term. Our restructuring charges are described further in Note 4, Restructuring Charges . Share-Based Compensation. We have a stock incentive plan under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, time-vested restricted shares, restricted share units, performance-vested restricted shares, and performance shares. Shares issued pursuant to awards under this plan may be made out of treasury or authorized but unissued shares. We record compensation expense related to stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and stock-settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. Forfeitures of awards are recognized as they occur. Additional information regarding the assumptions used to value share-based compensation awards is provided in Note 14, Share-Based Compensation . Capitalized Software Development Costs. The capitalization of software development cost for external use begins when a product’s technological feasibility has been established. Capitalization ends when the resulting product is available for general market release. Amortization of the capitalized software is classified within products cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For each capitalized software product, the annual amortization is equal to the greater of: (i) the amount computed using the ratio that the software product’s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or (ii) the amount computed based on straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, which is a range between three and eight years. The amount by which unamortized software costs exceeds the net realizable value, if any, is recognized as a charge to income in the period it is determined. We capitalized approximately $2.0 million , $8.2 million and $11.9 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Amortization of developed capitalized software was $12.6 million , $10.0 million and $8.0 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In April 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASU 2019-04 provides corrections, updates and clarifications to the previously issued updates ASU 2016-13, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-01. Various areas of the codification were impacted from the update. The standard follows the effective dates of the previously issued ASUs, unless an entity has already early adopted the previous ASUs, in which case the effective date will vary according to each specific ASU adoption. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and the other two ASUs affected by ASU 2019-04 are not applicable to us. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract . ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including 31 early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) . ASU 2018-02 addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on items within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, and ASU No. 2017-04 , Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018; the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are still assessing the impact of this standard, we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method, with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial adoption. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018; the adoption had no impact to our consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which provides guidance with the intent of reducing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018 the adoption had no impact to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Subsequent to this release, the FASB also released ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases and ASU No. 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements to provide clarifying guidance. Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a capital (finance) or operating lease. However, unlike current U.S. GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The most prominent change for lessees is the requirement to recognize both Right of Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. We have elected to use the transition method of adoption, with certain practical expedients available, to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the adoption date of April 1, 2019. 32 Topic 842 is effective for us beginning April 1, 2019. We have elected to adopt as of the effective date and have elected certain practical expedients as a part of our implementation process. During the preparation for implementation, we have reviewed our current control environment for necessary changes. The standard will have a material impact to our Consolidated Balance Sheets, however will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statements or Statements of Cash Flow. The accounting for our capital leases remains the same while our accounting for operating leases will change significantly as a result of the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities. We expect the impact of the recognition of ROU assets to be approximately $15 million and approximately $17 million of lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of April 1, 2019. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted ASU 2014-09 as of April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3, Revenue Recognition for further details. Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We have assets, liabilities, and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk. We sell products and services internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements. For the fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , revenue from international operations was 9%, 8% and 6%, respectively of total revenue. The effects of foreign currency on operating results did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the 2019 , 2018 and 2017 fiscal years. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee, could materially impact our revenue, expenses, operating profit and net income. We believe inflation has had a nominal effect on our results of operations in fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 and do not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal 2020. 33 Item 8.

Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agilysys, Inc. (an Ohio corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated May 24, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2016. Atlanta, Georgia May 24, 2019 35 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders Agilysys, Inc. Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Agilysys, Inc. (an Ohio corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019, and our report dated May 24, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Agilysys, Inc. and subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for by the equity or cost method, as appropriate. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated. Use of estimates. Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity from date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Other highly liquid investments considered cash equivalents with no established maturity date are fully redeemable on demand (without penalty) with settlement of principal and accrued interest on the following business day after instruction to redeem. Such investments are readily convertible to cash with no penalty and can include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, money market funds and other investments. Allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as historic trends of the entire customer pool. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. To mitigate this credit risk we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. Inventories. Our inventories are comprised of finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of related reserves. The cost of inventory is computed using a weighted-average method. Our inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation. Adjustments of inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, if necessary, are based upon contractual provisions such as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required. We provide a reserve for obsolescence, which is calculated based on several factors, including an analysis of historical sales of products and the age of the inventory. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. The carrying amount of goodwill was $19.6 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2018. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if indicators of potential impairment exist. The Company evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing its market capitalization based on its closing stock price (Level 1 input) to the book value of its equity on the annual evaluation date. Based on testing performed, the Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill has occurred for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The Company is also required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts at least annually, or when current events and circumstances require an interim assessment. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. 42 Table of Contents Intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are primarily amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over periods between two and eight years. Customer relationships are amortized over estimated useful lives between two and seven years; non-competition agreements are amortized over estimated useful lives between two and eight years; developed technology is amortized over estimated useful lives between three and eight years; supplier relationships are amortized over estimated useful lives between two and eight years. Long-lived assets. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance, repairs, and reengineering costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets, including assets recorded under capital leases, which make up less than one percent of total assets, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization are as follows: buildings and building improvements - 7 to 30 years; furniture - 7 to 10 years; equipment - 3 to 10 years; software - 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the economic life or the lease term. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on the project stage. Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 3 to 10 years, beginning with the project's completion. Depreciation for capitalized project expenditures does not begin until the underlying project is completed. We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Foreign currency translation. The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currencies are not in U.S. dollars are translated at the period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates during the fiscal year. The cumulative translation effects are reflected as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within shareholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an operation are reflected within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency gains and losses from changes in exchange rates have not been material to our consolidated operating results. Revenue recognition. We derive revenue from the sale of products (i.e., software, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. For the fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , revenue from international operations was 9% , 8% and 6% , respectively of total revenue. During fiscal 2017 we had one customer representing 10% of consolidated revenue for the year due to a large scale project. Otherwise, our customer base is highly fragmented. On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after the adoption date are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under prior guidance. Revenue recognition under Topic 606 Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have 43 Table of Contents concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. A majority of our hardware sales involve shipment directly from its suppliers to the end-user customers. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor as we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. Each of these performance obligations provide benefit to the customer on a standalone basis and are distinct in the context of the contract. Each of these distinct performance obligations represent a stand ready obligation to provide service to a customer, which is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer, which is why we account for these support services as a single performance obligation, recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. Typically, we invoice fees monthly and either party has the ability to cancel the agreement at each invoiced period. As a result, the contractual period for revenue recognition purposes is considered to be one month with monthly renewals for the term of the customer agreement. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. These contracts are reviewed quarterly for loss contract accounting treatment. We use the market estimate approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Comprehensive (loss) income. Comprehensive (loss) income is the total of net (loss) income, as currently reported under GAAP, plus other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income considers the effects of additional transactions and economic events that are not required to be recorded in determining net (loss) income, but rather are reported as a separate statement of comprehensive (loss) income. Fair value measurements . We measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. In determining fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use various valuation techniques. Additional information regarding fair value measurements is provided in Note 15, Fair Value Measurements . Investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies. Agilysys invests in corporate-owned life insurance policies, for which some are endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into non-cancelable agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with 44 Table of Contents their designated beneficiary. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. During fiscal 2017, we received $2.2 million related to the death benefit due to us on redemption of two of these policies. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the balance sheet date, the cash surrender value of $0.9 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiary of $0.1 million , which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities."" Additional information regarding the investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is provided in Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans . Income Taxes. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes and is based on reported income before income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from uncertain tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. Interest related to uncertain tax positions is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and is accrued beginning in the period that such interest would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Our income taxes are described further in Note 10, Income Taxes . Capitalized Software Development Costs. The capitalization of software development cost for external use begins when a product’s technological feasibility has been established. Capitalization ends when the resulting product is available for general market release. Amortization of the capitalized software is classified within products cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For each capitalized software product, the annual amortization is equal to the greater of: (i) the amount computed using the ratio that the software product’s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or (ii) the amount computed based on straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, which is a range between three and eight years. The amount by which unamortized software costs exceeds the net realizable value, if any, is recognized as a charge to income in the period it is determined. Advertising and Promotion Expense. We expense advertising and promotion expense as incurred. Advertising and promotion expense was $2.0 million , $2.7 million and $2.6 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In April 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASU 2019-04 provides corrections, updates and clarifications to the previously issued updates ASU 2016-13, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-01. Various areas of the codification were impacted from the update. The standard follows the effective dates of the previously issued ASUs, unless an entity has already early adopted the previous ASUs, in which case the effective date will vary according to each specific ASU adoption. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and the other two ASUs affected by ASU 2019-04 are not applicable to us. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract . ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value 45 Table of Contents measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) . ASU 2018-02 addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on items within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, and ASU No. 2017-04 , Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018; the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are still assessing the impact of this standard, we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method, with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial adoption. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018; the adoption had no impact to our consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which provides guidance with the intent of reducing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018 the adoption had no impact to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Subsequent to this release, the FASB also released ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases and ASU No. 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements to provide clarifying guidance. Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a capital (finance) or operating lease. However, unlike current U.S. GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The most prominent change for lessees is the requirement to recognize both Right of Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. We have elected to use the transition method of adoption, with certain practical expedients available, to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the adoption date of April 1, 2019. Topic 842 is effective for us beginning April 1, 2019. We have elected to adopt as of the effective date and have elected certain practical expedients as a part of our implementation process. During the preparation for implementation, we have reviewed our current control environment for necessary changes. The standard will have a material impact to our Consolidated Balance Sheets, however will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statements or Statements of Cash Flow. The accounting for our capital leases remains the same while our accounting for operating leases will change significantly as a result of the recognition of ROU 46 Table of Contents assets and lease liabilities. We expect the impact of the recognition of ROU assets to be approximately $15 million and approximately $17 million of lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of April 1, 2019. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted ASU 2014-09 as of April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Please refer to Note 3, Revenue Recognition for further details. Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 3. Revenue Recognition On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after the adoption date are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under prior guidance. For in depth discussion regarding our revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $39.0 million and over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $101.8 million for the fiscal period 2019. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $33.1 million . During the fiscal period ending March 31, 2019 , we transferred $4.6 million to accounts receivable from contract assets recognized at April 1, 2018 because the right to the transaction consideration became unconditional. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of March 31, 2019 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses would not have occurred absent the customer contract and are therefore considered incremental. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We have capitalized $ 1.9 million of sales incentive costs in prior periods as part of our opening retained earnings adjustment on April 1, 2018. As of March 31, 2019 , we had $3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the fiscal period ending March 31, 2019 , we expensed $4.5 million of sales commissions, including amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 1.1 million which is included in operating expenses - sales and marketing in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 47 Table of Contents Financial Statement Impact of Adoption on Previously Reported Results We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative impact of applying the new guidance to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of April 1, 2018 was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the adoption date. As a result of applying the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard, the following adjustments were made to noted accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2018: (In thousands) March 31, 2018 Adjustment from Topic 606 April 1, 2018 Assets: Accounts receivable, net 16,389 3,124 19,513 Contract assets — 4,583 4,583 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 5,593 (496 ) 5,097 Other non-current assets 2,484 2,409 4,893 Liabilities: Contract liabilities 26,820 7,006 33,826 Shareholders' equity: Retained earnings 103,601 2,614 106,215 The acceleration of revenue that was deferred under prior guidance as of the adoption date was primarily attributable to the requirement of Topic 606 to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative basis using SSP rather than allocating under the residual method, which allocates the entire arrangement discount to the delivered performance obligations. Due to the Company's full valuation allowance as of the adoption date, there is no tax impact associated with the adoption of Topic 606. We made certain presentation changes to our Consolidated Balance Sheet on April 1, 2018 to comply with Topic 606. Prior to adoption of the new standard, we offset accounts receivable and contract liabilities (previously presented as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet) for unpaid deferred performance obligations included in contract liabilities. Under the new standard, we record accounts receivable and related contract liabilities for non-cancelable contracts with customers when the right to consideration is unconditional. Upon adoption, the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time were reclassified from accounts receivable to contract assets. Impact of Topic 606 on Financial Statement Line Items The impact of adoption of Topic 606 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2019 and on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal period ending March 31, 2019 was as follows: 48 Table of Contents March 31, 2019 As reported Balance without adoption of Topic 606 Effect of Change Higher (Lower) (In thousands) Assets: Accounts receivable, net 27,000 23,046 3,954 Contract assets 2,921 — 2,921 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 6,272 6,665 (393 ) Other non-current assets 6,118 3,152 2,966 Liabilities: Contract liabilities 38,669 32,343 6,326 Shareholders' equity: Retained earnings 93,051 89,929 3,122 March 31, 2019 As reported Balance without adoption of Topic 606 Effect of Change Higher (Lower) (In thousands) Net revenue: Products 39,003 37,466 1,537 Support, maintenance and subscription services 75,496 76,330 (834 ) Professional services 26,343 27,201 (858 ) Total net revenue: 140,842 140,997 (155 ) Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 19,646 20,309 (663 ) Net Loss (13,164 ) (13,672 ) (508 ) The adoption of Topic 606 had no material impact to cash used in operating, investing or financing activities on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 4. Restructuring Charges We recognize restructuring charges when a plan that materially changes the scope of our business or the manner in which that business is conducted is adopted and communicated to the impacted parties, and the expenses have been incurred or are reasonably estimable. In addition, we assess the property and equipment associated with the related facilities for impairment. The remaining useful lives of property and equipment associated with the related operations are re-evaluated based on the respective restructuring plan, resulting in the acceleration of depreciation and amortization of certain assets. Fiscal 2018 Restructuring Plan During fiscal 2018, we continued our ongoing efforts to create more efficient teams across the business, which included certain executive changes during the year. To date, we have recorded $1.6 million in restructuring charges related to the fiscal 2018 restructuring plan, comprised of severance and other employee related benefits. There was no remaining liability for the fiscal 2018 restructuring plan as of March 31, 2019. 49 Table of Contents Following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the restructuring liability: Balance at Balance at March 31, March 31, (In thousands) 2018 Provision Payments 2019 Fiscal 2018 Restructuring Plan: Severance and employment costs $ 198 $ — $ (198 ) $ — Total restructuring costs 198 — (198 ) — Balance at Balance at March 31, March 31, (In thousands) 2017 Provision Payments 2018 Fiscal 2018 Restructuring Plan: Severance and employment costs $ — $ 1,639 $ (1,441 ) $ 198 Total restructuring costs — 1,639 (1,441 ) 198 5.

The Company capitalizes internal-use software, including software used exclusively in providing services or that is only made available to customers as a software service, as property and equipment under ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software. Total amortization expense on capitalized internal-use software was $2.5 million , $1.8 million and $1.4 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Assets under capital leases are included in property and equipment categories above. Total assets under capital leases at March 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 Capital leases $ 679 $ 679 Less accumulated depreciation (625 ) (509 ) Assets under capital lease, net $ 54 $ 170 50 Table of Contents 6. Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs at March 31, 2019 , and 2018 : 2019 2018 Gross Net Gross Net carrying Accumulated carrying carrying Accumulated carrying (In thousands) amount amortization amount amount amortization amount Amortized intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 10,775 $ (10,775 ) $ — $ 10,775 $ (10,775 ) $ — Non-competition agreements 2,700 (2,700 ) — 2,700 (2,700 ) — Developed technology 10,398 (10,398 ) — 10,398 (10,398 ) — Trade names 230 (192 ) 38 230 (146 ) 84 Patented technology 80 (80 ) — 80 (80 ) — 24,183 (24,145 ) 38 24,183 (24,099 ) 84 Trade names 8,400 N/A 8,400 8,400 N/A 8,400 Total intangible assets $ 32,583 $ (24,145 ) $ 8,438 $ 32,583 $ (24,099 ) $ 8,484 Software development costs $ 67,541 $ (32,974 ) $ 34,567 $ 53,368 $ (20,372 ) $ 32,996 Project expenditures not yet in use — — — 12,185 — 12,185 Total software development costs $ 67,541 $ (32,974 ) $ 34,567 $ 65,553 $ (20,372 ) $ 45,181 Indefinite-lived intangible assets, comprised of our purchased trade name InfoGenesis™ as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 are tested for impairment upon identification of impairment indicators or at least annually. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than fair value. The InfoGenesis™ indefinite-lived purchased trade name impairment testing resulted in a fair value exceeding the carrying amount for the years ending March 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . At each balance sheet date, the unamortized capitalized software development costs for external use is compared to the net realizable value of that product by analyzing critical inputs such as costs necessary to bring the software to market, life of the software, and market capacity. The amount by which unamortized software costs exceeds the net realizable value, if any, is recognized as a charge to income in the period it is determined. The following table summarizes our remaining estimated amortization expense relating to in service intangible assets and software development costs. Estimated Amortization (In thousands) Expense Fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 $ 12,599 2021 12,515 2022 5,403 2023 3,399 2024 689 Total $ 34,605 Amortization expense related to software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $12.6 million , $10.0 million and $8.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. These charges are included as Products cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization expense relating to other definite-lived intangible assets was $46,000 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . These charges are classified as operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Capitalized software development costs are carried on our balance sheets at net realizable value, net of accumulated amortization. We capitalized approximately $2.0 million , $8.2 million and $11.9 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 51 Table of Contents 7. Financing Arrangements The following is a summary of long-term obligations at March 31, 2019 , and 2018 : (In thousands) 2019 2018 Capital lease obligations $ 57 $ 177 Less: current maturities (22 ) (120 ) Long -term capital lease obligations $ 35 $ 57 Capital Leases Agilysys leases certain equipment under capital leases expiring in various years through fiscal 2022. The assets and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their related lease terms or their estimated productive lives. Assets recorded under capital leases were $0.7 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 . Accumulated depreciation related to assets recorded under capital leases was $0.6 million and $0.5 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Depreciation of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Minimum future lease payments under capital leases as of March 31, 2019 , are as follows: (In thousands) Amount Fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 $ 27 2021 23 2022 15 Total minimum lease payments $ 65 Less: amount representing interest (8 ) Present value of minimum lease payments $ 57 Interest rates on capitalized leases of 4.5% are imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease or the lessor's implicit rate of return. 8.

We completed the accounting for the Tax Act during Q3 fiscal 2019 and recorded an adjustment on December 31, 2018 of $0.2 million to increase our deferred tax liability associated with certain indefinite lived intangibles. We have elected to account for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusions in the period in which they are incurred. Our tax provision includes a provision for income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where subsidiaries are profitable, but only a minimal benefit is reflected related to U.S. and certain foreign tax losses due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of future benefits from these losses. The 2019 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax expense, the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the completion of our accounting for the Tax Act. The 2019 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. The 2018 tax provision primarily results from a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets due to passage of the Tax Act. The 2018 effective rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. 54 The 2017 tax provision primarily results from state taxes, taxes withheld in foreign jurisdictions and foreign tax expense. The 2017 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, are as follows: (In thousands) 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: Accrued liabilities $ 3,944 $ 2,720 Allowance for doubtful accounts 120 143 Inventory valuation reserve 41 20 Federal losses and credit carryforwards 45,227 42,713 Foreign net operating losses 730 623 State losses and credit carryforwards 9,886 9,592 Deferred revenue 488 652 Goodwill and other intangible assets — 286 Other 65 96 60,501 56,845 Less: valuation allowance (57,852 ) (54,260 ) Total 2,649 2,585 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment & software amortization (361 ) (412 ) Goodwill and other intangible assets (2,706 ) (2,277 ) Total (3,067 ) (2,689 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ (418 ) $ (104 ) At March 31, 2019 , we had $199.1 million of a federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038, and $11.5 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely. Our Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore subsidiaries have $0.4 million , $0.1 million , and $0.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards respectively. The losses for Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore can be carried forward indefinitely. At March 31, 2019 our India subsidiary had $0.4 million of minimum alternative tax credits reported as other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5 years of operations. The aggregate value of the benefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $0.5 million . At March 31, 2019 we also had $127.5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire, if unused, in fiscal years 2020 through 2039. We recorded valuation allowances related to certain deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. At March 31, 2019 , the total valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $57.9 million was comprised of $57.0 million for federal and state deferred tax assets, and $0.9 million associated with deferred tax assets in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code. Because of our losses in current and prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes. 55 The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes unless such earnings are distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested and totaled $3.1 million and $1.7 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We made the determination of permanent reinvestment on the basis of sufficient evidence that demonstrates we will invest the undistributed earnings overseas indefinitely for use in working capital, as well as foreign acquisitions and expansion. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we used the with-and-without approach for ordering tax benefits derived from the share-based payment awards. Using the with-and-without approach, actual income taxes payable for the period were compared to the amount of tax payable that would have been incurred absent the deduction for employee share-based payments in excess of the amount of compensation cost recognized for financial reporting. As a result of this approach, tax net operating loss carryforwards not generated from share-based payments in excess of cost recognized for financial reporting were considered utilized before the current period's share-based deduction. We recorded a liability for unrecognized tax positions. The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the years ended March 31: (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Balance at April 1 $ 687 $ 988 $ 1,617 Reductions: Relating to positions taken during prior year — (300 ) (604 ) Relating to lapse in statute (107 ) (1 ) (25 ) Balance at March 31 $ 580 $ 687 $ 988 As of March 31, 2019 , we had a liability of $0.6 million related to uncertain tax positions, the recognition of which would affect our effective income tax rate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited and the outcome of tax examinations could also result in a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. Other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. We recognize interest accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Penalties are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses. We recognized interest and penalty expense of less than $0.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had approximately $0.5 million and $0.8 million of interest and penalties accrued. In the U.S. we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns where statutes of limitations generally range from three to five years. Although we have resolved examinations with the IRS through tax year ended March 31, 2010, U.S. federal tax years are open from 2006 forward due to attribute carryforwards. The statute of limitations is open from fiscal year 2012 forward in certain state jurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in international jurisdictions where statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years. Years beginning after 2008 are open for examination by certain foreign taxing authorities. 11. Employee Benefit Plans 401(k) Plan We maintain 401(k) plans for employees meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation, and we match 100% of the first 1% of the employee's pre-tax contributions and 50% of the next 5% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. We may also make discretionary contributions each year for the benefit of all eligible employees under the plans. Agilysys matching contributions were $1.6 million , $1.7 million , and $1.4 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agilysys provides certain former executives with life insurance benefits through endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We entered into non-cancelable agreements with each of the former executives, whereby we must maintain the life insurance policy 56 Table of Contents for a specified amount and split a portion of the policy benefits with their designated beneficiary. During fiscal 2017, we received $2.2 million related to the death benefit due to us on redemption of two of these policies. Our investment in these corporate-owned life insurance policies were recorded at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value at the balance sheet date. In the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the cash surrender value of $0.9 million for the remaining policies were held in “Other non-current assets,” and the present value of future proceeds owed to those executives' designated beneficiaries of $0.1 million , which approximates fair value, were recorded within ""Other non-current liabilities."" Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies related to gains and losses incurred on these investments are classified within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded a gain of $15,000 dollars in fiscal 2019, a gain of $17,000 in fiscal 2018 and a gain of $18,000 in fiscal 2017 related to the corporate-owned life insurance policies. 12. Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases We lease certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through fiscal 2024 and require us to pay a portion of the related operating expenses such as maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. Certain facilities and equipment leases contain renewal options for periods up to ten years. In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Certain facilities leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. Rent expense under such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The following is a schedule by year of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases, excluding the related operating expenses, which have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of a year as of March 31, 2019 : (In thousands) Amount Fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 $ 4,143 2021 3,945 2022 3,166 2023 1,916 2024 1,770 Thereafter 4,497 Total minimum lease payments $ 19,437 Rental expense for all non-cancelable operating leases amounted to $3.9 million , $3.2 million , and $2.8 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Legal Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was 57 Table of Contents consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. Most of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. Cases against us and our co-defendants remained pending in the District Court with respect to one surviving Ameranth patent. In September 2018, the District Court found that patent invalid, and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In early 2019, Ameranth appealed the District Court's summary judgment ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We are not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or appeal may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 13. Loss per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing loss per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Year ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2019 2018 2017 Numerator: Net loss $ (13,164 ) $ (8,350 ) $ (11,721 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 23,037 22,801 22,615 Loss per share - basic and diluted: Net loss per share-basic and diluted $ (0.57 ) $ (0.37 ) $ (0.52 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares and performance shares 1,433 756 1,004 Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 300,437 , 334,817 and 490,355 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. In addition, when a net loss is reported, adjusting the denominator of diluted earnings per share would also be anti-dilutive to the loss per share, even if the entity has net income after adjusting for a discontinued operation. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 58 Table of Contents 14. Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) for up to 2.0 million common shares, plus 957,575 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is 1.25 million . We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. For stock options and SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of stock option and SSAR awards is seven years from the date of grant. Stock option and SSARs awards vest over a period established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. SSARs may be granted in conjunction with, or independently from, stock option grants. SSARs granted in connection with a stock option are exercisable only to the extent that the stock option to which it relates is exercisable and the SSARs terminate upon the termination or exercise of the related stock option grants. Restricted shares and restricted share units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based awards may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted shares and restricted share units have the right to receive dividends, or dividend equivalents in the case of restricted share units, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying awards. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the 2016 Plan, for awards to employees, no performance-based restricted shares or restricted share units shall be based on a restriction period of less than one year, and any time-based restricted shares or restricted share units shall have a minimum restriction period of three years. We record compensation expense related to stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and stock-settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : Year ended March 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Product development $ 1,478 $ 1,306 $ 1,545 Sales and marketing 469 371 360 General and administrative 2,429 3,011 522 Total share-based compensation expense $ 4,376 $ 4,688 $ 2,427 Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights (“SSARs”) are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled only in common shares of Agilysys. We use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of SSARs. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing SSARs granted in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : 2019 2018 2017 Risk-free interest rate 2.68% 1.74%-1.94% 0.94%-2.14% Expected life (in years) 5 5 5 Expected volatility 32.42% 32.42% - 32.84% 35.25%-40.22% Weighted average grant date fair value $4.72 $3.36 $3.69 59 Table of Contents The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected life of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded vesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date. The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2019 for SSARs awarded under the 2016 and 2011 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted- Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2018 1,103,160 $ 10.60 Granted 158,244 14.22 Exercised (193,819 ) 10.20 Forfeited (44,804 ) 10.91 Cancelled/expired (6,138 ) 10.62 Outstanding at March 31, 2019 1,016,643 $ 11.22 4.8 $ 7,251 Exercisable at March 31, 2019 707,950 $ 10.93 4.5 $ 7,251 Vested and expected to vest at March 31, 2019 1,016,643 $ 11.22 4.5 $ 10,111 The following table presents additional information related to SSARs activity during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Compensation expense $ 943 $ 1,869 $ 621 Total intrinsic value of SSARs exercised $ 907 $ 88 $ 360 Total fair value of SSARs vesting $ 1,165 $ 1,325 $ 497 As of March 31, 2019 , total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non-vested SSARs was $0.4 million , which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 2.8 years. A total of 44,331 shares, net of 15,698 shares withheld to cover the employee’s minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury shares to settle SSARs exercised during the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 . The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees under the 2016 and 2011 Plans, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 for restricted shares awarded under the 2016 and 2011 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2018 243,354 $ 10.78 Granted 265,452 14.66 Vested (197,917 ) 12.74 Forfeited (73,743 ) 11.3 Outstanding at March 31, 2019 237,146 $ 13.46 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. During fiscal 2019 , a total of 197,917 shares, net of 47,146 shares withheld from the vested restricted shares to cover the employee's minimum applicable income taxes, were issued from treasury. The shares withheld were returned to treasury shares. 60 Table of Contents The following table presents additional information related to restricted stock activity during fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Compensation expense $ 2,803 $ 2,594 $ 1,770 Total fair value of restricted share vesting $ 4,383 $ 4,315 $ 1,182 As of March 31, 2019 , total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $1.0 million , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 3.5 years. We do not include restricted stock in the calculation of earnings per share until the shares are vested. Performance Shares The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2019 for performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant- Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2018 91,463 $ 9.84 Granted 63,291 14.22 Vested (15,822 ) $ 9.84 Forfeited (75,641 ) $ 9.84 Outstanding at March 31, 2019 63,291 $ 14.22 Based on the performance goals, management estimates a liability of $630,000 to be settled through the vesting of a variable number of the performance shares subsequent to March 31, 2019 . As of March 31, 2019 , total stock based compensation expense related to performance shares has been fully recognized. The following table presents additional information related to performance share activity during the fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 : (In thousands) 2019 2018 2017 Compensation expense $ 630 $ 225 $ 36 Total fair value of performance share vesting $ 243 $ — 83 Once attainment of the performance goals becomes probable, compensation expense related to performance share awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period based upon the closing market price of our common shares on the grant date. 15. Fair Value Measurements We estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. We assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy. The hierarchy indicates the extent to which pricing inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Level 1 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and are the most observable. Level 2 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities that are either directly or indirectly observable, or other observable inputs such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates, and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market and include our own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable and unobservable inputs is reflected in the hierarchy assessment disclosed in the tables below. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 . 61 Table of Contents The following tables present information about our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value: Fair value measurement used Recorded value as of Active markets for identical assets or liabilities Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs Active markets for unobservable inputs (In thousands) March 31, 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 895 — — $ 895 Fair value measurement used Recorded value as of Active markets for identical assets or liabilities Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs Active markets for unobservable inputs (In thousands) March 31, 2018 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 853 — — $ 853 The recorded value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is adjusted to the cash surrender value of the policies obtained from the third party life insurance providers, which are not observable in the market, and therefore, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies are recorded within “Other expenses (income), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table presents a summary of changes in the fair value of the corporate-owned life insurance Level 3 asset for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 : Level 3 assets and liabilities (In thousands) 2019 2018 Corporate-owned life insurance: Balance on April 1 $ 853 $ 809 Realized Gains 15 17 Unrealized (loss) gain relating to instruments held at reporting date 27 27 Balance on March 31 $ 895 $ 853 16. Quarterly Results (Unaudited) Because quarterly reporting of per share data is used independently for each reporting period, the sum of per share amounts for the four quarters in the fiscal year will not necessarily equal annual per share amounts. GAAP prohibits retroactive adjustment of quarterly per share amounts so that the sum of those amounts equals amounts for the full year. Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results. 62 Table of Contents Year ended March 31, 2019 First Second Third Fourth Year (In thousands except per share data) Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Net revenue $ 34,007 $ 34,203 $ 36,014 $ 36,618 $ 140,842 Gross profit 17,889 17,749 18,647 19,595 73,880 Restructuring, severance and other charges 440 448 58 222 1,168 Legal settlements 91 35 — 15 141 Net loss $ (1,736 ) $ (3,791 ) $ (4,048 ) $ (3,589 ) $ (13,164 ) Net loss Per share data-basic and diluted $ (0.08 ) $ (0.16 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.15 ) $ (0.57 ) Year ended March 31, 2018 First Second Third Fourth Year (In thousands except per share data) Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Net revenue $ 33,865 $ 30,129 $ 31,310 $ 32,056 $ 127,360 Gross profit 16,670 15,370 15,628 16,749 64,417 Restructuring, severance and other charges 37 826 378 557 1,798 Legal settlements — — 150 — 150 Net loss $ (2,958 ) $ (3,248 ) $ (1,934 ) $ (210 ) $ (8,350 ) Net loss Per share data-basic and diluted $ (0.13 ) $ (0.14 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.01 ) $ (0.37 ) 63 Table of Contents 17.

Change in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Agilysys, under the supervision of the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision of our CEO and CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2019 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on that evaluation, management concluded that Agilysys maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2019 . Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued their report regarding Agilysys' internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2019 , which is included elsewhere in this annual report. Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 64 Item 9B.

To the Corporation’s knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports filed on the SEC’s EDGAR system and written representations that no other reports were required, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were complied with; except that (i) due to administrative error JW Asset Management LLC was late filing one Form 4 with respect to one transaction, (ii) Lisa Swartzman, a Director of the Corporation, was late filing one Form 4 with respect to one transaction, and (iii) Richard Mavrinac, a former Director of the Corporation, was late filing one Form 4 with respect to one transaction. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION As an “emerging growth company,” TerrAscend is required to provide a Summary Compensation Table and an Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table, as well as limited narrative disclosures regarding executive compensation for our last completed fiscal year. These reporting obligations extend only to our “named executive officers”, who are the individuals who (i) served as our principal executive officer, (ii) our two other most highly compensated executive officers other than the principal executive officer, and (iii) up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been required but for the fact that the individual was not serving as one of our executive officers during the last completed fiscal year (the “ Named Executive Officers ” or “ NEOs ”). Each of the NEOs are employed in their respective NEO role for an indefinite period time, in accordance with each NEO’s employment agreement as outlined in “Compensation of Named Executive Officers” . All arrangements for NEOs are as outlined in their respective employment agreement and as otherwise determined by the Board. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, the Corporation’s Named Executive Officers were: Name Age Position Jason Wild 50 Executive Chairman (1) Ziad Ghanem 45 President and Chief Executive Officer (2) Keith Stauffer 53 Chief Financial Officer Lynn Gefen 51 Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary (3) ________________ (1) Jason Wild, as Executive Chairman, performed certain functions of an executive officer until the Corporation appointed Ziad Ghanem as President and Chief Operating Officer on January 5, 2022. (2) Mr. Ghanem was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer on January 5, 2022 and was promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer on March 29, 2023. (3) Ms. Gefen was appointed Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary on May 23, 2022. The following disclosure outlines the Corporation’s pay decisions in 2022 for the NEOs and directors and provides context for the data presented in the accompanying compensation tables. Compensation Philosophy and Goals The Board makes decisions regarding all forms of compensation, including salaries, bonuses and equity incentive compensation, paid to the Corporation’s CEO, CFO and other executive officers, as applicable, as well as approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to their compensation. The Board also administers employee incentive compensation, including the Corporation’s Stock Option Plan and RSU Plan. The Corporation’s compensation practices are designed to retain, motivate and reward its executive officers and directors for their performance and contribution to the long-term success of the Corporation. The Board seeks to compensate executive officers by combining short-term and long-term cash and equity incentives. It also seeks to reward the achievement of corporate and individual performance objectives and to align executive officers’ incentives with the Corporation’s performance. The Corporation seeks to tie individual goals to the area of the executive officer’s primary responsibility. These goals may include the achievement of specific 3 financial, strategic or business development goals. Corporate performance goals are tied to the Corporation’s financial performance during the applicable financial year. In order to achieve the Corporation’s growth objectives, attracting and retaining the right team members is critical. A key part of this is providing compensation that attracts high performers and compensates them for their continued achievements. Employee participation in the Stock Option Plan and the RSU Plan drives employee retention, entrepreneurial behavior and share ownership. The Corporation’s communication of clear and concrete criteria and process for merit-based increases and bonuses also motivates its employees to achieve individual and corporate goals. Summary Compensation Table The following table sets out all compensation paid, payable, awarded, granted, given, or otherwise provided, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation to each NEO who performed such functions, in any capacity, during the financial years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. All NEOs were paid in US dollars.

The Board conducts reviews with respect to officer compensation at least once a year. Compensation for executive officers is established based on the scope of their responsibilities and their prior relevant experience, taking into account compensation paid by other companies in the industry for similar positions and the overall market demand for such executives. The Board, through the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Compensation Committee”), reviews the public disclosure available for other comparable cannabis companies to assist in determining the competitiveness of the base salary, bonuses, benefits and stock options paid to the executive officers of the Corporation, to ensure that the executive officer’s total compensation is in line with the Corporation’s overall total rewards philosophy. The Compensation 4 Committee may, but is not obligated to, benchmark compensation to members of its peer group or similar companies as the Corporation matures. Base salaries are reviewed annually and are increased for merit reasons, based on the executive’s success in meeting or exceeding individual objectives and/or for market competitiveness. Additionally, base salaries can be adjusted as warranted throughout the year to reflect promotions or other changes in the scope or breadth of an executive’s role or responsibilities, as well as for market competitiveness. See section below entitled “ Employment, Consulting and Management Agreements ” for details related to each NEO. The Corporation’s employee compensation program includes eligibility for annual incentive cash bonuses. Parameters for NEO bonuses are set out in each executive’s employment agreement and the Corporation’s annual incentive plan (“AIP”). See section below entitled “ Employment, Consulting and Management Agreements ” for details related to each NEO. Each NEO has defined performance objectives determined with consideration to the role of the executive. Bonuses paid pursuant to the AIP are based on financial and non-financial results of the Corporation. Financial parameters used to determine the financial performance of the Corporation are the revenue and EBITDA of the Corporation and revenues and EBITDA at the divisional level each as compared with the budget. For each of these parameters and levels, there are minimum and maximum expectations annually. In 2022, bonus determinations were based largely on the financial performance of the Corporation. However, there was recognition by the Board, through the Compensation Committee, that NEOs should be compensated based on progress for strategic initiatives to be implemented beyond the current fiscal year, in addition to the financial performance of the Corporation. This permits the Corporation to acknowledge contributions which will have delayed financial value. As formally introduced into the Corporation’s AIP on April 25, 2022, NEOs are assessed on the forward-looking strategic initiatives. This has been reviewed and subsequently detailed further by the Compensation Committee at the end of 2022. As a result, for 2023, NEO bonuses have the following breakdown: 60% is based on the Corporation’s performance and 40% is based on progress for strategic initiatives for the future. The Compensation Committee has discretion to adjust bonuses as they deem appropriate. The Corporation currently has in place a rolling 10% Stock Option Plan and an RSU Plan. See section below entitled “ Stock Option Plan and RSU Plan ” for a description of the Stock Option Plan and RSU Plan. Stock Option Plan and RSU Plan Stock Option Plan The purpose of the Stock Option Plan is to (i) provide the Corporation with the advantages of the incentive inherent in equity ownership in the Corporation by directors, officers, consultants and key employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries; (ii) create in such persons a proprietary interest in, and a greater concern for, the welfare and success of the Corporation; (iii) encourage such persons to remain with the Corporation and its subsidiaries; and (iv) attract employees, directors and consultants of the highest calibre by offering them an opportunity to share in any increase in value of the Common Shares resulting from their efforts. The following is a summary of the Stock Option Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stock Option Plan, as amended incorporating the Stock Option Plan Amendments assuming the requisite approval of the Stock Option Plan Resolution, which is attached as Schedule “B” to the Corporation’s definitive proxy statement filed May 2, 2023 and is available under the Corporation’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . The Corporation currently has in place a rolling 10% Stock Option Plan, pursuant to which approximately 20,111,246 Options were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The Board is responsible for administering the Stock Option Plan. At the Meeting, Shareholders are being asked to approve an increase to the aggregate plan limit for the Stock Option Plan and the RSU Plan (together with any other share compensation arrangement of the Corporation) from a rolling 10% to 15% of the outstanding Common Shares on each date on which the award is granted (on a non-diluted basis). The Stock Option Plan currently provides that the number of Common Shares that may be reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options to purchase Common Shares (and together with any other share compensation arrangement of the Corporation, including the RSU Plan) will not exceed (in the aggregate) 10% of the outstanding Common Shares on each date on which the Option or other award, as applicable, is granted (the “Grant Date”) on a non-diluted basis. The Corporation is required, at all times during the term of the Stock Option Plan, to reserve and keep available the number of Common Shares necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Stock Option Plan. The number of Common Shares reserved for issuance to any one person under an Option granted pursuant to the Stock Option Plan, when combined with the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under all awards granted within the one-year period prior to the Grant Date under all other share compensation plans, including the Stock Option Plan and the RSU Plan, may not exceed 5% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares at the Grant Date on a non-diluted basis, unless the Corporation has obtained disinterested shareholder approval. The number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under an award granted pursuant to the Stock Option Plan 5 to any (i) consultant, or (ii) party providing investor relation services, when combined with the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under all Options granted within the one-year period prior to the Grant Date to (i) all consultants, or (ii) all parties providing investor relation services, respectively, cannot exceed 2% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares on the Grant Date on a non-diluted basis. Unless disinterested shareholder approval is obtained, the number of Common Shares that may be reserved for issuance to insiders pursuant to the grant of Options under the Stock Option Plan and under any other share compensation arrangement, including the RSU Plan, will not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the outstanding Common Shares on a non-diluted basis at any point in time. Unless disinterested shareholder approval is obtained, an Option may only be granted to an insider under the Stock Option Plan if the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under that Option, when combined with the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under awards granted within the one-year period before the Grant Date by the Corporation to insiders under all other share compensation plans, including the Stock Option Plan and the RSU Plan, does not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the outstanding Common Shares on the Grant Date on a non-diluted basis. Options to purchase Common Shares granted under the Stock Option Plan will have an exercise price not less than the “fair market value” of a Common Share on the Grant Date, being the five (5) day volume weighted average price of the Common Shares based on the Grant Date of the Option. The exercise price, term and vesting of options to purchase Common Shares shall otherwise be as approved by the Board. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, options to purchase Common Shares typically vest and become exercisable at a rate of 25% on each of the first four anniversary dates from the date of grant. Common Shares which have been issued on the exercise of an option will again be available for grants under the Stock Option Plan, and will be considered to be part of the pool of Common Shares available for options to purchase Common Shares under the Stock Option Plan. Any Common Share subject to an option granted under the Stock Option Plan that expires or terminates without having been exercised shall again be available for a grant of options under the Stock Option Plan. The term of the Options to purchase Common Shares granted under the Stock Option Plan shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Options granted pursuant to the Stock Option Plan are non-transferable. RSU Plan The purpose of the RSU Plan is to: (i) promote a further alignment of interests between directors, officers, consultants and key employees of the Corporation, or a subsidiary, and the shareholders of the Corporation; (ii) associate a portion of such persons’ compensation with the returns achieved by shareholders of the Corporation; and (iii) attract and retain such directors, officers, consultants and key employees with the knowledge, experience and expertise required by the Corporation. The following information is a summary of the material terms of the Corporation’s RSU plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the RSU Plan, as amended incorporating the RSU Plan Amendments and assuming the requisite approval of the RSU Plan Resolution, which is attached as Schedule “C” to the Corporation’s definitive proxy statement filed May 2, 2023 and is available under the Corporation’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The Corporation currently has in place a RSU Plan, pursuant to which 415,640 RSUs were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The Board is responsible for administering the RSU Plan. At the Meeting, Shareholders are being asked to approve an increase to the aggregate plan limit for the RSU Plan and the Stock Option Plan (together with any other share compensation arrangement of the Corporation) from a rolling 10% to 15% of the outstanding Common Shares on each date on which the award is granted (on a non-diluted basis). Pursuant to the RSU Plan, the number of Common Shares that may currently be reserved for issuance under the RSU Plan and under any other share compensation plans of the Corporation, including the Stock Option Plan, will not exceed (in the aggregate) 10% of the outstanding Common Shares on the grant date on a non-diluted basis. The Corporation is required, at all times during the term of the RSU Plan, to reserve and keep available the number of Common Shares necessary to satisfy the requirements of the RSU Plan. The number of Common Shares reserved for issuance to any one person pursuant to the grant of awards under the RSU Plan, when combined with the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under all awards granted within the one-year period prior to the Grant Date under all other share compensation plans, including the Stock Option Plan and the RSU Plan, may not exceed 5% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares at the Grant Date on a non-diluted basis, unless the Corporation has obtained disinterested shareholder approval. The number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under an award granted pursuant to the RSU Plan to any: (i) consultant, or (ii) party providing investor relation services, when combined with the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under all awards granted under the RSU Plan within the one-year period prior to the Grant Date to (i) all consultants, or (ii) all parties 6 providing investor relation services, respectively, cannot exceed 2% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares on the Grant Date on a non-diluted basis. Unless disinterested shareholder approval is obtained, the number of Common Shares that may be reserved for issuance to insiders pursuant to the grant of awards under the RSU Plan and under any other share compensation arrangement, including the Stock Option Plan, will not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the outstanding Common Shares on a non-diluted basis at any point in time. Unless disinterested shareholder approval is obtained, an award under the RSU Plan may only be granted to an insider under the RSU Plan if the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under that award, when combined with the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under awards granted within the one-year period before the Grant Date by the Corporation to insiders under all other share compensation plans, including the Stock Option Plan and the RSU Plan, does not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the outstanding Common Shares on the Grant Date on a non-diluted basis. Grant Date by the Corporation to insiders under all other share compensation plans, including the Stock Option Plan and the RSU Plan, does not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the outstanding Common Shares on the Grant Date (including any Common Shares issuable on exchange of the outstanding proportionate voting shares and exchangeable shares of the Corporation, but otherwise on a non-diluted basis). Any vested RSUs will be settled in the form of Common Shares as provided in the applicable award agreement. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, RSUs typically vest over a four year period and are settled on each of the first four anniversary dates from the date of grant. Awards granted under the RSU Plan will have a market value on any given date of the closing price of the Common Shares on any exchange the Corporation is then listed on the trading day prior to the relevant date. The term, vesting and any performance conditions applicable to an award of RSUs shall be as approved by the Board. RSUs awarded pursuant to the RSU Plan are non-transferable.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedures The Corporation adopted a related person transaction policy on January 25, 2023 that sets forth our procedures for the identification, review, consideration and approval or ratification of related person transactions. For purposes of our policy only, a related person transaction is a transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which we and any related person are, were or will be participants in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee or director are not covered by this policy. A related person is any executive officer, director or beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, including any of their immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. Under the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related person transaction, including any transaction that was not a related person transaction when originally consummated, any transaction that was not initially identified as a related person transaction prior to consummation, our management must present information regarding the related person transaction to our Audit Committee, or, if Audit Committee approval would be inappropriate, to another independent body of our Board of Directors, for review, consideration and approval, ratification, or rejection. The presentation must include a description of, among other things, (a) all of the parties thereto, (b) the interests, direct or indirect, of any related person in the transaction, (c) a description of the purpose of the transaction, (d) all of the materials facts of the proposed transaction, including the proposed aggregate value of such transaction, or, in the case of indebtedness, that amount of principal that would be involved, (e) the benefits to the Corporation of the proposed transaction, (f) if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services, (g) an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as the case may be, an unrelated third party or to employees generally, and (h) management’s recommendation with respect to the proposed transaction. In considering related person transactions, our Audit Committee, or other independent body of our Board of Directors, will take into account the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to: The policy requires that, in determining whether to approve, ratify or reject a related person transaction, our Audit Committee, or other independent body of our Board of Directors, shall approve only those transactions that, in light of known circumstances, it determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion are in, or are not inconsistent with, our best interests and our stockholders' best interests. Certain Related Person Transactions 11 The following includes a summary of transactions since January 1, 2022 to which the Corporation has been a party, in which the amount involved in the transaction or proposed transaction is in excess of $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers or, to our knowledge, any person or company who beneficially owns, controls or directs directly or indirectly, more than 5% of our voting securities or any associate or affiliate (including member of the immediate family) of any of the forgoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest by way of beneficial ownership of securities or otherwise. Other than as described below, there have not been, nor are there currently any proposed, transactions or series of similar transactions to which the Corporation has been or will be a party other than compensation arrangements, which include equity and other compensation, termination, or change in control and other arrangements, which are described under “Executive Compensation” and “Statement of Director Compensation”. On August 31, 2021, the Corporation entered into a definitive arrangement agreement (the “ Arrangement Agreement ”) with Gage Growth Corp. (“ Gage ”), pursuant to which TerrAscend was to acquire all of the issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares of Gage by way of a court- approved plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act . The arrangement was approved at the special meeting of the Corporation’s Shareholders on November 11, 2021, and the arrangement closed on March 10, 2022, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all remaining closing conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Gage shareholders received 0.3001 of a Common Share for each Gage share (or equivalent) held. Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, TerrAscend issued an aggregate of 51.2 million Common Shares and up to 25.8 million Common Shares were reserved for issuance in connection with the exercise or exchange of former Gage convertible securities if and when exercised or exchanged. At the time of the Arrangement Agreement, the transaction was valued at approximately $545mm, exclusive of convertible securities subject to exercise or exchange. A copy of the Arrangement Agreement is available on the Corporation’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. The acquisition of Gage was a “related party transaction” pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 — Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“ MI 61-101 ”) and was subject to Part 5 of MI 61-101, as Mr. Wild is a control person of the Corporation and was a control person of Gage, and as Mr. Mavrinac was a director of the Corporation and was a director of Gage. While technically exempt from the minority approval requirement of MI 61-101 pursuant to Section 5.7(a) thereof, the Corporation sought and obtained approval from minority Shareholders of the Corporation at the special meeting of the Corporation’s Shareholders on November 11, 2021 as an additional procedural safeguard to ensure the rights of minority Shareholders were appropriately considered in respect of the acquisition of Gage. Indemnification Agreements The Corporation indemnifies its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law pursuant to indemnification agreements entered between the Corporation and each of its directors and officers. Each indemnification agreement also provides that, on satisfaction of certain conditions, the Corporation will advance expenses incurred by a director or officer prior to the final disposition of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer or director for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether the Corporation would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under the provisions of Ontario law. Director Independence Pursuant to National Instrument 52-110 – Audit Committees (“NI 52-110”), a director is considered to be independent if he or she has no direct or indirect material relationship with the Corporation that the Board believes could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with his or her ability to exercise independent judgment. NI 52-110 sets out certain situations where a director is deemed to have a material relationship with the Corporation.As of May 2, 2023, the Board consisted of six persons, three of whom the Corporation believes to be independent based upon the tests for independence set forth in NI 52-110: Mr. Craig Collard, Ms. Ira Duarte and Ms. Kara DioGuardi. Mr. Jason Wild is not an independent director as he served as an executive officer of the Corporation. Ms. Lisa Swartzman is not an independent director as she has accepted a consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Corporation, other than as remuneration for acting in her capacity as a member of the Board. Mr. Ed Schutter is not an independent director as he is the former Chief Executive Officer of Arbor, a privately held company in respect of which Mr. Wild was also a director and served as a member of the Arbor compensation committee (although this is no longer the case given the sale of Arbor in September 2021; Mr. Wild and Mr. Schutter are no longer involved with Arbor). In 2021, the Board appointed Mr. Collard as the lead independent director of the Board. We meet the director independence for our listing with the OTCQX Best Market, being a minimum of two independent directors and a majority of the audit committee being comprised of independent directors. Our Common Shares are not currently quoted or listed on any U.S. national exchange or interdealer quotation system that has a requirement that a majority of our Board be independent. Audit Committee The Audit Committee is currently comprised of Ms. Swartzman, Ms. Duarte (Chair), and Mr. Collard. Ms. Swartzman will not be standing for re-election to the Board. Ms. Duarte and Mr. Collard have been determined by the Board to be independent for the purposes of NI 52-110. Ms. Swartzman is not considered by the Board to be independent within the meaning of NI 52-110. Our listing with the OTCQX Best Market requires a majority of the audit committee be comprised of independent directors. Based on the education and breadth of experience of each member of the Audit Committee, the Board has determined each such member to be financially literate within the meaning of NI 52-110. 12 Reliance on Certain Exemptions At no time since the commencement of the Corporation’s most recently completed financial year has the Corporation relied on the following exemptions contained in NI 52-110: Exemption for Venture Issuers The Corporation is a “venture issuer” as defined in NI 52-110 and is relying on the exemption in section 6.1 of NI 52-110 relating to Parts 3 ( Composition of Audit Committee ) and 5 ( Reporting Obligations ) of NI 52-110. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee is currently comprised of Mr. Schutter (Chair) as well as Mr. Collard and Ms. DioGuardi, the latter two of whom are independent directors within the meaning of NI 52-110. Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee In March 2023, the Corporation established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“ NCGC ”). The NCGC is currently comprised of Mr. Collard (Chair), as well as Ms. DioGuardi and Mr. Duarte, all of whom are independent directors within the meaning of NI 52-110. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES Principal Accountant Fees and Services The following table sets out the fees for services provided to the Corporation by our independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(2) Consists of fees for audit services. This includes, among other things, quarterly reviews and audit of the annual financial statements, including audit of historical financial statements converted from International Financial Reporting Standards to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“ US GAAP ”), and services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. Included in audit fees are audit services of $636,335 relating to the Corporation’s Form 8-K for the acquisition of Gage Growth Corp. The 8-K filing included the December 31, 2021 audited standalone financial statements of Gage Growth Corp. (3) Consists of fees that traditionally are performed by the independent accountant. This includes, among other things, review of the Registration Statement on Form 10 and the Registration Statements on Form S-8 and S-3 filings. (4) Consists of fees billed for tax planning, tax advice and various taxation matters. The Corporation’s audit committee (the “ Audit Committee ”) pre-approved all services provided by MNP in 2022. The Audit Committee has pre-approved all services anticipated to be provided by MNP during 2023. Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures On March 15, 2023, the Corporation adopted an Audit Committee Pre-approval Policy for the approval of services of the independent registered accounting firm. The Policy sets forth the particular services that may be pre-approved on a collective basis as well as the procedures for such pre-approval. The policy generally pre-approves specified services in the defined categories of audit-services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the Audit Committee’s approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent auditor or on an individual, explicit, case-by-case basis before the independent auditor 13 is engaged to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated to one or more of the Audit Committee’s members, but the decision must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 14 PART IV ITEM 15.

Form 10-K Summary 91 Signatures 93 Index to the Consolidated Financial Statements F- 1 i Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that TerrAscend Corp. (""TerrAscend"" or the ""Company"") believes are, or may be considered to be, “forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the prospects of TerrAscend’s industry or TerrAscend’s prospects, plans, financial position or business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""can"", “expect”, “likely”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “potential”, “proposed”, “estimate” and other similar words, including negative and grammatical variations thereof, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” happen, or by discussions of strategy. Forward-looking statements include estimates, plans, expectations, opinions, forecasts, projections, targets, guidance, or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: 1 Certain of the forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and the general expectations of TerrAscend concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by TerrAscend using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry. Such data is inherently imprecise. The cannabis industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors, which factors are described further below. With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, TerrAscend has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which TerrAscend operates; (iii) the output from TerrAscend’s operations; (iv) consumer interest in TerrAscend’s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of TerrAscend’s activities and products and in the areas of taxation and environmental protection; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) TerrAscend’s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; (x) TerrAscend’s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner; and (xi) the Company’s construction plans and timeframe for completion of such plans. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of TerrAscend, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States (""U.S."") relating to cannabis operations in the U.S.; and those discussed under Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The purpose of forward-looking statements is to provide the reader with a description of management’s expectations, and such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for any other purpose. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. TerrAscend can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct.

BUSINESS Overview TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated licensed operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Maryland and California, and is a cannabis retailer in Ontario, Canada with a minority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent and high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use markets. Notwithstanding the fact that various states in the U.S. have implemented medical marijuana laws or that have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. TerrAscend operates under one operating segment, which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend owns a portfolio of operating businesses and several synergistic brands including: TerrAscend’s head office and registered office is located at 3610 Mavis Road, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, L5C 1W2.

Operating Businesses and Brands TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan and California, licensed cultivation and processing operations in Maryland, and licensed processing operations in Canada. Michigan Business- Gage and Pinnacle TerrAscend entered into the Michigan market when it acquired Gage, a wholly-owned subsidiary, in March 2022. The Michigan business is innovating and curating high quality cannabis experiences for cannabis consumers in the state of Michigan and in 8 Canada, and bringing renowned brands to market. The Michigan business has successfully built and grown operations with state licenses, including cultivation, processing and retail locations. Gage's portfolio includes city and state approvals for 19 ""Class C"" cultivation licenses, three processing licenses and 18 provisioning centers (dispensaries). On August 23, 2022, TerrAscend acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings, LLC (collectively, ""Pinnacle""), a dispensary operator in Michigan, and related real estate. The transaction included six retail dispensary licenses, five of which are currently operational and located in the cities of Addison, Buchanan, Camden, Edmore, and Morenci, Michigan. TerrAscend intends to rebrand each of the dispensaries under either the Gage or Cookies retail brand. Northeast Business TerrAscend is a vertically integrated operator in the Northeast with licenses in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. Pennsylvania- The Apothecarium, Ilera Healthcare and Keystone Canna Remedies TerrAscend acquired Ilera, a wholly-owned subsidiary, in September 2019.

In addition, Ilera operates three Apothecarium-branded retail dispensaries, one in Plymouth Meeting, a second in Lancaster, and a third in Thorndale. In April 2021, TerrAscend added three additional retail dispensaries located in Bethlehem, Allentown and Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania through the acquisition of Guadco, LLC and KCR Holdings LLC (collectively “KCR”) by TerrAscend's wholly-owned subsidiary, WDB Holding PA, Inc. (""WDB Holding PA""). For more information regarding TerrAscend's acquisitions of Ilera and KCR, please see the sections below titled ""Reorganization — Acquisitions — Acquisition of Ilera"" and ""—Acquisition of Keystone Canna Remedies"". Through these Pennsylvania dispensaries, TerrAscend is able to offer a variety of products and formats for medical use, produced by Ilera and other manufacturers, to ensure pharmacists and wellness associates can provide appropriate product to meet a particular patient's needs. New Jersey- TerrAscend NJ TerrAscend NJ is a vertically integrated cultivator, processor and dispenser of cannabis in New Jersey’s northern region. Under New Jersey law, alternative treatment centers are vertically integrated and are able to cultivate and process medical and adult use cannabis, and operate up to three dispensaries. TerrAscend NJ is a majority-owned subsidiary of TerrAscend, whose minority partners are BWH NJ, LLC and Blue Marble Ventures, LLC. TerrAscend NJ owns a 16-acre site in Boonton Township, Morris County that currently has a cultivation and processing facility with a total footprint of approximately 140,000 square feet with the ability to further expand on the site. In addition to cultivation, TerrAscend NJ is also engaged in the extraction, processing and manufacturing of a wide range of branded form factors including, vaporizables, concentrates, topicals, tinctures and edibles and currently operates three Apothecarium-branded dispensaries in Phillipsburg, Lodi, and Maplewood, New Jersey. Maryland- The Apothecarium TerrAscend is a vertically integrated operator in Maryland. Under the medical marijuana law, operators are allowed up to 1 processor license, 1 cultivation license and up to 4 dispensary licenses. On May 3, 2021, TerrAscend, through its wholly owned subsidiary WDB Holdings MD, Inc. (“WDB MD”), acquired HMS Health LLC, which held a cultivation license. Simultaneously, TerrAscend acquired control of HMS Processing LLC through a master services agreement. On June 23, 2022, TerrAscend acquired 100% of HMS Processing, LLC enabling TerrAscend to own a processor license. The cultivator/processor operation includes a newly renovated state-of-the-art 150,000 square foot facility located in Hagerstown, Maryland and the full transition of the operations to Hagerstown occurred in October 2022. In its Maryland business, TerrAscend produces dried flower and oil products for the medical cannabis market and is the process of receiving approval to produce edibles. On January 27, 2023, TerrAscend closed on its previously announced acquisition of Allegany Medical Marijuana Dispensary (""AMMD""), 9 a medical dispensary in Maryland from Moose Curve Holdings, LLC. TerrAscend intends to rebrand the 10,000 square foot dispensary as The Apothecarium. AMMD is TerrAscend’s first dispensary in the State of Maryland. California Business- The Apothecarium Dispensaries, Valhalla and State Flower The Apothecarium Dispensaries include a group of licensed, full-service dispensaries in northern California that provide quality cannabis to both medical patients and adult-use customers. The dispensaries are known for emphasizing education and customer service for seniors, first-time dispensary visitors, and patients with serious medical conditions. The focus is on providing guests with in-depth, one-on-one consultations from trained cannabis consultants. The Apothecarium Dispensaries also provide free cannabis education events that are open to the public. Guests may purchase their cannabis in the dispensaries or order online for pickup or delivery. There are currently five Apothecarium Dispensaries in California, including three in San Francisco, one in Berkeley and one in Capitola. The flagship dispensary located in the Castro district of San Francisco was previously named the best-designed dispensary in the country by Architectural Digest. Valhalla is a premier manufacturer of select cannabis-infused artisan edibles that are gluten free, in both gelatin and vegan varieties, and made with ingredients free of chemically formulated fertilizers, growth stimulants, antibiotics, or pesticides, all while maintaining eco-friendly practices. State Flower is a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Francisco, California. Florida Business- Arise On January 15, 2019, TerrAscend, through its wholly owned subsidiary Arise, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Grander Distribution, LLC (“Grander”). Arise is currently engaged in the production and distribution of innovative hemp-derived wellness products. Arise’s whole-plant hemp extract products are made in the United States and are available for sale in retail locations in the United States. Effective March 1, 2023, TerrAscend sold substantially all of the Arise assets, including all intellectual property and inventory, to a third party. TerrAscend Canada TerrAscend Canada is a cannabis retailer in Ontario Canada with a minority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (""Cookies Canada""), and its current principal business activities include the retail sale of recreational (""recreational"" or ""adult-use"") cannabis to consumers. TerrAscend Canada was previously a Licensed Producer (as such term is defined in the Cannabis Act) of cannabis until TerrAscend commenced an optimization of its operations in Canada, whereby TerrAscend reduced its manufacturing footprint in order to focus on its Cookies Canada retail business, as well as monetize its intellectual property portfolio in Canada. Prior to the optimization of its operations, TerrAscend Canada operated out of a 67,300 square foot facility located in Mississauga, Ontario and was licensed to cultivate, process and sell cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes. These licenses allowed for sales of dried cannabis, cannabis oil and extracts, topicals, and edibles. TerrAscend ceased operations at its manufacturing facility during the three months ended December 31, 2022. As such, the Canadian Licensed Producer results are presented in discontinued operations in this Annual Report. Reorganization Entry into the U.S. Cannabis Market and Capital Reorganization TerrAscend was incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act on March 7, 2017. At the time TerrAscend had limited operations in the U.S. and did not engage in the business of, or derive any revenue from, the cultivation, distribution or possession of cannabis in the United States. On October 9, 2018, TerrAscend announced its intention to pursue growth opportunities in the U.S. cannabis market, including potential acquisitions of operators in states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. In connection therewith, TerrAscend began exploring potential acquisition targets with significant market share and strong brand recognition. To support this strategy, TerrAscend entered into an agreement with Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy Growth”), RIV Capital Inc. (formerly Canopy Rivers Inc.) (“RIV Capital”), and entities controlled by Jason Wild, chairman of TerrAscend (JW Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd., JW Partners, LP, and Pharmaceutical Opportunities Fund, LP) to reorganize the capital of TerrAscend (the “TerrAscend Reorganization”) and obtain waivers of certain contractual covenants that at the time, restricted TerrAscend from operating in the U.S. The TerrAscend Reorganization was implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement on the terms set out in the Arrangement Agreement and was subject to court approval, the approval of TerrAscend’s shareholders, and other customary conditions. The TerrAscend Reorganization was completed on November 30, 2018. 10 Acquisitions Acquisition of Grander Assets On December 24, 2018, TerrAscend announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Grander, a manufacturer and distributor of hemp-derived wellness products. The transaction closed on January 15, 2019. Substantially all of the operating assets of Grander were indirectly acquired by TerrAscend through a wholly owned subsidiary Arise. As consideration, TerrAscend paid $12.7 million, comprising $6.5 million in cash, 1,362,343 Common Shares, and $0.5 million in working capital adjustments. The fair value of the Common Shares was $5.1 million as at January 15, 2019. Subject to meeting certain earnings milestones, TerrAscend agreed to pay up to an additional $10 million in cash or share considerations. The total value of the potential purchase consideration payable by TerrAscend under the terms of the agreement was approximately $22.7 million, and the fair value of the contingent consideration was $0.6 million as at January 15, 2019. Based on performance of the Arise business during the measurement period, the milestones for the additional $10 million payment were not met and the total purchase consideration paid by TerrAscend remained $12.7 million. Acquisition of The Apothecarium Dispensaries in Northern California On June 6, 2019, TerrAscend closed a series of transactions to acquire controlling interests in three entities in California operating the retail dispensary brand known as “The Apothecarium.” The transactions also included the acquisition of entities that were seeking to operate two additional retail locations in Northern California, which were ultimately opened in Berkeley and Capitola, and Valhalla, a leading provider of premium edible products. TerrAscend acquired 49.9% of the outstanding equity interests of the entities operating the three San Francisco The Apothecarium Dispensary locations and TerrAscend has the right (or, in certain circumstances, obligation) to acquire the remaining equity interests of those entities post-closing, following receipt of certain regulatory approvals. As consideration, TerrAscend paid $71.8 million, comprising $36.8 million in cash, $1.1 million in the form of a working capital adjustment, contingent consideration of $3 million and 6,700 TerrAscend proportionate voting shares (“Proportionate Voting Shares”). TerrAscend retains 100% of the economics of entities operating the three San Francisco locations and the Berkeley and Capitola locations of The Apothecarium Dispensaries through control of such entities. Acquisition of Ilera On September 16, 2019, TerrAscend acquired 100% of the equity of the entities comprising Ilera for total consideration of $225 million paid in a combination of cash and Common Shares. At closing, TerrAscend paid to the sellers $25 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, an additional $25 million worth of Proportionate Voting Shares in the equity of TerrAscend equivalent to approximately 5,059.102 Proportionate Voting Shares (which are each exchangeable for 1,000 Common Shares), and $601,000 in working capital adjustments. Additional cash consideration of $175 million in aggregate was paid to the sellers based on Ilera achieving certain specified sales and profitability targets, with staged payments made in 2020 and 2021. On June 30, 2021 the final earn-out had been calculated and remaining fair value amount of $29.7 million was paid on that date. Acquisition of State Flower On January 23, 2020, TerrAscend obtained control of ABI SF LLC, owner of State Flower, a premium California cannabis brand that is currently sold through dispensaries in California. As consideration, TerrAscend converted its previously issued note receivable and accrued interest in the amount of $3 million into a 49.9% equity interest in State Flower. TerrAscend also recorded contingent consideration payable of $6.6 million, representing the expected consideration payable to acquire the remaining 50.1% of State Flower, which comprises 100% of its preferred shares, subject to regulatory approval. TerrAscend retains 100% of the economics of State Flower through control of ABI SF LLC and has the right to acquire the remaining equity interests of ABI SF LLC, following receipt of certain regulatory approvals. On December 31, 2021, the final earn-out was calculated. TerrAscend made a payment of $7.0 million in January 2022. The remaining amount of $1.4 million will be paid to the sellers of State Flower upon TerrAscend’s acquisition of the remaining 50.1% of State Flower. Acquisition of HMS On May 3, 2021, TerrAscend, through a wholly owned subsidiary, WDB MD, acquired HMS, a cultivator of cannabis flower for the wholesale medical cannabis market in Maryland. TerrAscend acquired 100% of the equity of HMS Health and the rights to acquire 100% of the equity of HMS Processing, a processor of cannabis flower, post-closing following receipt of certain regulatory approvals, for total consideration of $24.5 million comprised of $22.4 million in cash and a $2.1 million note, bearing 5.0% annual interest, which was settled when due in April 2022. TerrAscend retains 100% of the economics of HMS through full ownership of HMS Health and a master services agreement with HMS Processing. 11 Acquisition of Keystone Canna Remedies On April 30, 2021, TerrAscend, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired KCR (the ""KCR Acquisition""). The transaction added three retail dispensaries located in Bethlehem, Allentown and Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Prior to the acquisition, TerrAscend owned 10% of KCR. TerrAscend acquired the remaining 90% of the equity for total consideration of $69.8 million comprised of $34.4 million in Common Shares, $20.5 million in cash, $7.1 million related to the fair value in previously owned shares, and a $6.8 million noting bears 10% annual interest, and was settled when due in April 2022. New Jersey Partnership On August 20, 2021, TerrAscend purchased an additional 12.5% (previously owned 75%), with an option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership, of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ from BWH NJ, LLC and Blue Marble Ventures, LLC for a total cash consideration of $50 million, which was paid during the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon closing of the agreement, TerrAscend now owns 87.5% of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ. TerrAscend has the option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership, for a total of 93.75%, at a predetermined valuation during the period commencing April 1, 2023 through June 15, 2023. Acquisition of Gage On March 10, 2022, TerrAscend acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Gage, a cultivator, processor, and retailer with operations in the Michigan market (the ""Gage Acquisition""). Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement agreement, for each Gage subordinate voting share and other equity instruments, including outstanding stock options and warrants, each holder received a 0.3001 equivalent replacement award of TerrAscend's respective security at the time of closing based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (""CSE"") on March 10, 2022. On the acquisition date there was consideration in the form of 51,349,978 Common Shares valued at $242.9 million, 13,504,500 exchangeable units valued at $66.6 million, 4,940,364 replacement stock options with a fair value of $13.1 million, and 282,023 replacement warrants with a fair value of $0.4 million. Acquisition of Pinnacle On August 23, 2022, TerrAscend acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings, LLC (collectively, ""Pinnacle""), a dispensary operator in Michigan, and related real estate, for total consideration of $31.0 million, which included consideration paid in cash of $12.3 million, two promissory notes in an aggregate amount of $10.0 million, and 4,803,184 Common Shares of TerrAscend, no par value, valued at $7.9 million (the ""Pinnacle Acquisition""). The cash consideration paid included repayments of indebtedness and transaction expenses on behalf of Pinnacle of $3.9 million and $0.6 million respectively. The transaction includes six dispensary licenses, five of which are currently operational and located in the cities of Addison, Buchanan, Camden, Edmore, and Morenci, Michigan. TerrAscend intends to rebrand each of the dispensaries under either the Gage or Cookies retail brand. Acquisition of AMMD For more information regarding the Acquisition of AMMD, please see Item 1 - ""Business"" - ""Subsequent Transactions"". Principal Products TerrAscend offers a competitive product portfolio, ranging from flower, concentrates, vaporizables, edibles and/or accessories, in the jurisdictions in which TerrAscend operates. TerrAscend strives to develop and introduce innovative products to serve patients’ and customers’ unique needs. Principal Markets TerrAscend currently has operations in the United States and Canada. In the United States, TerrAscend sells cannabis products in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and California. In Canada, TerrAscend operates its Cookies Canada retail business, as well as is monetizing its intellectual property portfolio. TerrAscend’s Arise business also sells whole-plant hemp extract products in retail locations across the United States where legally permitted. TerrAscend’s business is not generally cyclical or seasonal in nature. 12 Distribution Methods TerrAscend distributes its branded products across dispensaries in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan and California. In Canada, TerrAscend sells its products to consumers in Ontario. TerrAscend’s Arise business also sells whole-plant hemp extract products in retail locations across the United States where legally permitted. Sources and Availability of Materials TerrAscend grows or procures the primary component of its finished products, namely cannabis. TerrAscend’s cultivation operations are dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to its growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other utilities. Specialized Knowledge and Skills TerrAscend’s business requires specialized skills and knowledge. TerrAscend believes its team has developed and sourced business systems to effectively and efficiently operate its wholesale operations and retail cannabis operations in the states and provinces in which it operates in the U.S. states and Canadian provinces in which it operates. The brand building, retail marketing and product development knowledge and skills of TerrAscend’s management team and employees will be essential to TerrAscend becoming a well-respected household name within the retail cannabis industry. Please see Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” – “ Risks Related to TerrAscend’s Business, Operations and Industry ” – “TerrAscend is dependent on suppliers and key inputs for the cultivation, extraction and production of cannabis products .” Competitive Conditions TerrAscend faces, and will continue to face, competition from new and existing licensed cannabis operators, competitors with existing retail operations, government owned retailers and the illicit market and other applicable participants in the cannabis wholesale and manufacturing industry. Some of the competitors of TerrAscend may have greater financial resources, market access and manufacturing and marketing experience than TerrAscend. Due to challenging market conditions in certain states, some operators have exited the industry and in doing so have heavily discounted their products, creating pressure on pricing. Increased competition by numerous independent cannabis retail outlets, wholesalers and larger and better financed competitors (including new entrants), and heavily discounted products by exiting players could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. TerrAscend’s competition can be grouped into the following categories: 13 Protection of Intellectual Property The ownership and protection of TerrAscend’s intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of TerrAscend’s future success. Currently the Company relies on trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information. The Company protects its intellectual property by seeking and obtaining registered protection where possible, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information and entering into restrictive agreements with parties that have access to the Company’s inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as TerrAscend’s partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership. The Company also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its inventions, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of the Company’s premises and physical and electronic security of its information technology systems. In addition, the Company has sought and will continue to seek trademark protection in the United States and Canada. TerrAscend’s ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada, including the United States, where registered federal trademark protection is currently unavailable for trademarks covering marijuana-related products and services that are illegal under the CSA. Accordingly, TerrAscend’s ability to obtain intellectual property rights or enforce intellectual property rights against third party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain countries. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released a policy on May 2, 2019 that clarifies that applications for trademarks for products that meet the definition of hemp could be accepted for registration, with certain exceptions. Human Capital As of December 31, 2022, TerrAscend employed 1,125 employees, none of whom were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Of these employees, approximately 972 were full-time. TerrAscend believes it has a good relationship with its employees. TerrAscend believes in building a diverse team, and it strives to make TerrAscend a welcoming space where everyone can make an impact on TerrAscend’s success. TerrAscend encourages talented people from all backgrounds to join TerrAscend and strives to make it a place of inclusion. TerrAscend is committed to providing a safe and secure work environment in accordance with applicable labor, safety, health, anti-discrimination and other workplace laws. TerrAscend strives for all TerrAscend’s employees to feel safe and empowered at work. To that end, TerrAscend maintains a hotline that employees can call, with the option of remaining anonymous, to voice concerns. Licenses and Regulatory Framework in United States TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, as applicable, currently hold all necessary state licenses and permits to carry on the activities it conducts. Summary of U.S. Cannabis Regulatory Regime The cannabis industry is subject to various state and local laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale, storage and disposal of medical and recreational cannabis, as well as laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. The U.S. regulatory scheme varies in its terminology and definitions, using “cannabis”, “marijuana” and “hemp” as distinct terms. The regulatory environment governing the medical and recreational marijuana industries in the United States, where state law permits such activities, are, and will continue to be, subject to evolving regulation by governmental authorities. Accordingly, there are a number of risks associated with investing in businesses in an evolving regulatory environment, including, without limitation, increased industry competition, rapid consolidation of industry participants and potential insolvency of industry participants. 38 states plus the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam that have authorized medical marijuana and approximately 21 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Northern Marina Islands who have authorized adult-use marijuana. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of medical, and in some cases also recreational marijuana at the state level, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug under the CSA, making it illegal under U.S. federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute, sell or possess marijuana in the United States. Furthermore, financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the United States may form the basis for prosecution under applicable U.S/ federal money laundering legislation. 14 The U.S. federal government’s approach to enforcement of marijuana laws has trended toward deference to state laws where a robust state regulatory framework exists. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) issued a memorandum known as the “Cole Memorandum” to all U.S. Attorneys’ offices. The Cole Memorandum generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws against individuals and businesses that comply with state medical marijuana programs. The Cole Memorandum, while not legally binding and only a policy statement, assisted in managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning all medical and adult-use state-regulated marijuana businesses. On January 4, 2018, the Cole Memorandum was rescinded by former Attorney General Sessions. While this did not create a change in federal law, the revocation added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the CSA in states where marijuana use is regulated. Former Attorney General Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum” which confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained that the Cole Memorandum was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual. While the Sessions Memorandum does emphasize that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and states the statutory view that it is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise indicate that the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses is a heightened DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion. Such prosecutorial discretion remains in the hands of U.S. Attorneys when deciding whether or not to prosecute marijuana-related offenses. On November 7, 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned as U.S. Attorney General. On February 14, 2019, William Barr was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the next Attorney General. During one of his Senate confirmation hearings, Mr. Barr stated that he did not support cannabis legalization but would not prosecute cannabis businesses that comply with state laws. Mr. Barr stated further that he would not upset settled expectations that have arisen as a result of the Cole Memorandum. On March 11, 2021, Merrick Garland was appointed U.S. Attorney General. Mr. Garland indicated he would generally act in accordance with the Cole Memorandum, when, at his confirmation hearing, he said, “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.” He has not, however, reissued the Cole Memorandum or issued substitute guidance. While enforcement of federal laws against regulated state entities does not appear to be a U.S. DOJ priority, the U.S. DOJ may change its enforcement policies at any time, with or without advance notice. For the reasons set forth herein, TerrAscend’s existing investments in the United States, and any future investments, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, TerrAscend may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on TerrAscend’s ability to invest in the United States or any other jurisdiction. Government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the marijuana industry in the United States or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public’s perception of marijuana in the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, such a shift could cause state and local jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical or recreational marijuana, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which TerrAscend could expand. Any inability to fully implement TerrAscend’s expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, under United States federal law, it may be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of marijuana or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the United States, could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to marijuana businesses. It may also be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for “federal health care law violations,” which include violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities, civil forfeiture or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its marijuana licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for TerrAscend to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. For the reasons set forth above, TerrAscend’s investments and operations in the United States may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. 15 TerrAscend may also be subject to a variety of laws and regulations domestically and in the United States that relate to money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Criminal Code (Canada) and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States and Canada. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a marijuana business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy. In February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on marijuana-related violations of the CSA and independently lists the federal government’s enforcement priorities as related to marijuana. Although the original FinCEN Memorandum is still in place, this supplementary Department of Justice guidance that accompanied the FinCEN Memorandum was rescinded when former Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. It is unclear whether the current administration will follow the guidelines of the FinCEN Memorandum, although immediately after the Sessions Memorandum, then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that the Treasury Department had no intention to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum but, instead, wanted to improve the availability of banking services in the state-regulated marijuana space. The position of current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is relatively unknown. In the foreseeable future, TerrAscend expects any amounts payable by TerrAscend from its subsidiaries to remain in the United States to fund the further development of its businesses. TerrAscend may also consider future debt or equity financings. H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, which would expand financial services in the United States to marijuana-related legitimate businesses and service providers, was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives (the “House”) on March 7, 2019 with bipartisan support. On April 11, 2019, S. 1200, the U.S. Senate (the “Senate”) version of the SAFE Banking Act, was filed. This bill also has bipartisan support and more than a fifth of the total Senate, 27 members, co-sponsored it. On September 25, 2019, H.R. 1595 passed in the House by a vote of 321 to 103, but it stalled in the U.S. Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on May 15, 2020, when it was included in the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act. However, that measure also stalled in the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on April 19, 2021 as H.R. 1996, by a vote of 321 – 101. The bill was received by the Senate and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, where it remained. On September 23, 2021, the House approved the National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) that contained the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The SAFE Banking Act was subsequently removed from the NDAA by the House-Senate conference committee on December 7, 2021, and was not included in the final version of the NDAA. On February 4, 2022, the House passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022, which included the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The legislation has yet to be affirmed by the Senate. Other legislation that has been introduced in the United States that would make cannabis transactions easier and more predictable, include the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the “MORE Act”) and the Cannabis Administration and Opportunities Act (the “CAOA”). The MORE Act was first introduced in July 2019 by Representative Jerrold Nadler in the House, and in the Senate by then-U.S. Senator Kamala Harris. If it were to become law, the MORE Act would remove cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and make available U.S. Small Business Administration funding for regulated cannabis operators. The MORE Act was reintroduced in the current U.S. Congress (“Congress”) by Representative Nadler on May 28, 2021, with no corresponding bill introduced in the Senate. The CAOA was released as a discussion draft by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, and U.S. Senator Cory Booker in July 2021. If it were to become law it would, among other things, remove cannabis from the definition of a controlled substance under the CSA, allow states to set their own regulations for cannabis, and block states from prohibiting interstate commerce of regulated cannabis across their borders. Recently introduced into Congress is another bill, the States Reform Act (“SRA”), introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), which would repeal the federal prohibition of cannabis. Despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, one legislative safeguard for the medical marijuana industry remains in place. Congress has used a rider known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment in the fiscal year 2015, 2016 and 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Acts (the “RBA”) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. However, this measure does not protect adult-use marijuana businesses. As part of the $1.3 trillion federal spending bill enacted on March 23, 2018, Congress renewed the RBA through September 2018, and subsequently extended it further. The RBA is an appropriations rider that prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent states from implementing marijuana laws. The U.S. Ninth Circuit in United States v. McIntosh held that the prohibition under the RBA also prevents the DOJ from 16 spending federal funds to prosecute individuals who are engaged in conduct that is permitted by, and in compliance with, state medical marijuana laws. State-Level Overview The following section presents an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the marijuana industry in U.S. states in which TerrAscend has or is intending to have an operating presence and is presented as of the date of filing, unless otherwise indicated. California In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act, allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying medical conditions including chronic pain. The law established a not-for-profit patient/caregiver system but there was no state licensing authority to oversee the businesses that emerged as a result of the system. In September of 2015, the California legislature passed three bills, collectively known as the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act. In 2016, California voters passed The Adult Use of Marijuana Act, which legalized recreational use cannabis for adults 21 years of age and older and created a licensing system for commercial cannabis businesses. Note, California defines “cannabis” to mean “marijuana.” On June 27, 2017, then-Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 94 into law, which combined California’s medicinal and recreational use cannabis frameworks into one licensing structure under the Medicinal and Adult-Use of Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”). Pursuant to MAUCRSA: (i) CalCannabis, a division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was designated to issue licenses to cannabis cultivators: (ii) the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch (the “MCSB”), a division of the California Department of Public Health, was designated to issue licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (iii) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via its agency the Bureau of Cannabis Control (the “BCC”), was designated to issue licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers, and micro-businesses. These agencies were also charged with overseeing various aspects of implementing and maintaining California’s cannabis landscape, including the statewide track and trace system. All three agencies released their initial emergency rulemakings at the end of 2017 and updated them with minor revisions in June 2018. The three agencies adopted their permanent rulemakings on January 16, 2019. All three agencies began issuing temporary licenses in January 2018 and stopped doing so on December 31, 2018, pursuant to MAUCRSA. Local authorization is a prerequisite to obtaining a state license, and local governments are permitted to prohibit or otherwise regulate the types and number of cannabis businesses allowed in their locality. All three state regulatory agencies require confirmation from the applicable locality that the operator is operating in compliance with local requirements and was granted authorization to continue or commence commercial cannabis operations within the locality’s jurisdiction. Applicants are required to comply with all local zoning and land use requirements and provide written authorization from the property owner where the commercial cannabis operations are proposed to take place, which must dictate that the applicant has the property owner’s authorization to engage in the specific state-sanctioned commercial cannabis activities proposed to occur on the premises. The State has not set a limit on the number of state licenses an entity may hold, unlike other states that have restricted how many cannabis licenses an entity may hold in total or for various types of cannabis activity. Although vertical integration across multiple license types is allowed under MAUCRSA, testing laboratory licensees may not hold any other licenses aside from a laboratory license. There are also no residency requirements for ownership of a state license under MAUCRSA. California state licenses, and some local licenses, are renewed annually. Each year, licensees are required to submit a state renewal application to the relevant regulatory authority, and all applicable local renewal applications to the applicable local regulatory body (for local licenses) such as the Department of Cannabis Regulation in the City of Los Angeles. On July 12, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-141 into law, triggering the consolidation of CalCannabis, the MCSB, and the BCC into the newly created Department of Cannabis Control (the “DCC”). The DCC was created in an effort to centralize regulatory authority and facilitate a more easily navigable regulatory regime. All licenses obtained under the previous regulatory authorities automatically transferred to the DCC, which will be responsible for issuing and renewing all cannabis licenses moving forward. In September 2021 the DCC issued emergency regulations, which were approved and went into effect the same month. The emergency regulations, among other things, include revised definitions clarifying who are considered to be owners or holders of a financial stake in cannabis businesses, and provisions allowing for the sale of branded products between businesses. California’s robust regulatory system is designed to ensure, monitor, and enforce compliance with all aspects of a cannabis operator’s licensed operations. California’s state license application process additionally requires comprehensive criminal, regulatory, financial and personal disclosures, coupled with stringent monitoring and continuous reporting requirements designed to ensure only good actors are granted licenses and that licensees continue to operate in compliance with the state 17 regulatory program. Applicants must submit standard operating procedures describing how the operator will, among other requirements, secure the facility, manage inventory, comply with the state’s seed-to-sale tracking requirements, dispense cannabis, and handle waste, as applicable to the license sought. Once licensed, an operator must continue to abide by the processes described in its application and seek regulatory approval before any changes to such procedures can be made. Licensees are additionally required to train their employees on compliant operations and are only permitted to transact with other legal and licensed businesses. As a condition of state licensure, operators must consent to random and unannounced inspections of their commercial cannabis facility as well as all of the facility’s books and records, so as to monitor and enforce compliance with state law. Many localities have also enacted similar standards for inspections, and the state has already commenced site-visits and compliance inspections for operators who have received state temporary or annual licensure. New Jersey On January 18, 2010, the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act (the “CUMMA”) came into force allowing patients with a limited number of qualifying medial conditions to access the state’s medical marijuana program. The New Jersey Department of Health (the “NJDOH”) issued regulations shortly thereafter authorizing the NJDOH to accept applications for a minimum of six alternative treatment centers (the “ATCs”), with two each to operate in the north, central and south regions of New Jersey. CUMMA permits each ATC to operate as both a cultivator and dispensary under one permit. These activities can take place at up to two locations, as long as both locations are within the same region. The application process involves two stages. Those seeking an ATC permit must first submit an application seeking authority to apply for a permit to operate. Upon the granting of the application, the prospective ATC must then complete the application for actual permitting. Applications for authority to apply for a permit may only be submitted following solicitation from NJDOH for such applications. The first six permits for ATCs were awarded to nonprofit entities, with subsequent permits to be available to both nonprofit and for-profit entities. In 2013, CUMMA was amended to allow ATCs to cultivate an unlimited number of strains of marijuana and sell additional marijuana-infused products, and to restrict the same of marijuana-infused edible products to qualifying patients under the age of 18. With additional authorizations, ATCs may also house manufacturing facilities for marijuana-infused products such as syrups and lozenges. All marijuana is subject to a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) limit of 10%, though NJDOH is proposing to repeal the regulation that establishes this limit. Upon taking office on January 16, 2018, Governor Murphy expanded the medical program by issuing Executive Order No. 6, which ordered a 60-day review of all aspects of New Jersey’s current program, “with a focus on ways to expand access to marijuana for medical purposes.” In response to Executive Order No. 6, NJDOH released its EO 6 Report on March 23, 2018, which proposed significant changes to the existing medicinal program. In an effort to create greater patient access, the state immediately put into effect some of the recommended changes, including cutting registration and renewal fees, and expanding qualifying conditions. On July 16, 2018, the Murphy Administration announced that the licensing application process would be opened for up to six additional vertically integrated medicinal marijuana ATCs. The NJDOH released a Notice of Request for Applications outlining the reason for issuing the licenses, eligibility rules and information required for the applications. The application period opened on August 1, 2018 and closed on August 31, 2018. Winning applicants were supposed to be selected on or before November 1, 2018 but this deadline was subsequently pushed to December due to administrative constraints. On December 17, 2018, NJDOH revealed the additional six medical marijuana ATCs it picked to add to the program. New Jersey will now have 12 vertically-integrated ATCs across the state, if these additional six applicant ATCs become operational. These six applicant ATCs now must pass background checks, provide evidence of cultivation and dispensary locations with municipal approval for each location, and comply with all regulations promulgated by the NJDOH, including safety and security requirements. On March 25, 2019, a planned vote on legislative package including medical expansion and adult-use legalization was pulled due to a lack of votes necessary to pass the legislation through the state Senate. This setback came after significant momentum had helped to pass the bill through the appropriations and judiciary committees earlier in the month. After the package of cannabis reforms stalled, Governor Murphy announced he would be expanding the medical program through administrative action. This announcement has proved contentious as the Senate President claims any regulatory changes for medical cannabis would make securing the votes necessary to pass adult-use legalization more difficult. On May 14, 2019, the Senate President announced he would no longer work to advance adult-use legalization through the legislature and instead would pivot to put the issue before voters for the 2020 general election. While legalization stalled, bills to expand the state’s medical program and reform criminal penalties continued to move forward. On December 18, 2020, Governor Murphy signed A. 5981/S. 4154 into law, which facilitates the expungement of low-level marijuana crimes and other offenses. And, on November 3, 2020, New Jersey voters passed a ballot measure amending the New Jersey Constitution to permit the use of marijuana for adults over 21 years of age. The ballot measure will also allow New Jersey to regulate the growth, distribution, and sale of adult-use marijuana. 18 On November 4, 2020, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal issued a statement reminding New Jersey residents that the state’s criminal laws related to marijuana still apply until the state legislature enacts a framework for adult-use cannabis. On February 22, 2021, Governor Murphy signed the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (“CREAMMA”) into law, legalizing the use of marijuana by adults 21 years of age and older in New Jersey. On August 19, 2021, New Jersey’s Cannabis Regulatory Commission (“CRC”) published its first set of rules associated with adult-use cannabis in the state. These rules outline the details of licensing, the authority of municipalities, the operations of cannabis businesses, and the CRC’s authority over adult-use cannabis. Adult-use sales in New Jersey commenced on April 21, 2022. Pennsylvania The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with one or more of 17 qualifying conditions, including: epilepsy, chronic pain and PTSD. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations per retail license). On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would initiate its rollout, which included 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional dispensary licenses. Additionally, the list of qualifying conditions was expanded from 17 to 21. On July 20, 2019, two more qualifying medical conditions were added, bringing the total to 23. There are two principal license categories in Pennsylvania: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. All cultivation/processing establishments and dispensaries must register with Pennsylvania Department of Health. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. The Pennsylvania Department of Health must renew a permit unless it determines the applicant is unlikely to maintain effective control against diversion of medical cannabis and the applicant is unlikely to comply with all laws as prescribed under the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program. Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the license holder to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell and purchase medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health under the provisions of Medical Marijuana Act and Pennsylvania regulations. The medical cultivation/processing licenses permit the licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. The retail dispensary licenses permit TerrAscend to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products. Maryland The Maryland medical cannabis program was signed into law on May 2, 2013. In 2016, the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission issued preliminary licenses to 102 dispensaries, 15 cultivators, and 15 processors; the first dispensaries opened to patients in December 2017. Maryland has three classes of cannabis licenses: dispensaries, cultivators, and processors. Wholesaling occurs between cultivators and processors, cultivators and dispensaries, and processors and dispensaries. Originally, no one Company could directly control multiple licenses of the same class, but this restriction was changed in May 2019 when Governor Hogan signed a bill that permitted a single company to own or control, including the power to manage or operate, up to four dispensaries. Dispensary locations are tied to the Senate District in which they were awarded, with the exception of dispensary licenses that were awarded to applicants who also were awarded a cultivation license. These dispensaries can be located at the discretion of the license holder. Permitted products include oil-based formulations, flower, and edibles. In April 2018, the Maryland House and Senate approved a bill, which was later signed by Governor Hogan, that expanded the license pool, allowing for a maximum of seven additional cultivation licenses, for a total of 22, and 13 additional processing licenses, for a total of 28. As of March 1, 2022, there were approximately 95 licensed dispensaries, 18 licensed cultivators, and 19 licensed processors. In November 2022, the voters in Maryland approved adult-use cannabis as a ballot question. Beginning on July 1, 2023, adults 21 or older may possess and consume up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower, 12 grams of concentrated cannabis, or a total amount of cannabis products that does not exceed 750 mg THC. This amount is known as the ""personal use amount."" Adult-use sales are expected to begin around the same time. 19 Michigan In November 2008, Michigan residents approved the Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative to provide a legal framework for individuals with certain debilitating medical conditions to lawfully use marijuana for medicinal purposes. In September 2016, the Michigan Legislature passed, and Governor Snyder signed into law, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act (the “MMFLA”) and the Marihuana Tracking Act (the “MTA”) to provide a comprehensive licensing and tracking scheme, respectively, for state’s medical marijuana program. In 2018, Michigan voters approved Proposal 1, to make marijuana legal under state and local law for adults 21 years of age or older and to control the commercial production and distribution of marijuana under a system that licenses, regulates, and taxes the businesses involved. The proposal is known as the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act (the “MRTMA” and together with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (the “MMMA”), the MMFLA, and the MTA, the “Michigan Cannabis Laws”). Additionally, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (“LARA”) and the MRA have supplemented the Michigan Cannabis Laws with administrative rules and bulletins to further clarify the regulatory landscape surrounding the state’s medical and adult use marijuana programs. The MRA is the main regulatory authority for the licensing and regulation of medical and adult use marijuana businesses, and is an agency within LARA. Under the MMFLA, the MRA administrates five types of “state operating licenses” for medical marijuana businesses: (a) a “grower” license, including three different classes of licenses: (i) a Class A license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 500 plants; (ii) a Class B license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 1,000 plants; and (iii) a Class C license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 1,500 plants, (b) a “processor” license, (c) a “secure transporter” license, (d) a “provisioning center” license and (e) a “safety compliance facility” license. Likewise, under the MRTMA, the MRA administers six types of “state licenses” for adult use marijuana business: (a) a “marihuana grower” license, including three different classes of licenses: (i) a Class A license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 100 plants; (ii) a Class B license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 500 plants; and (iii) a Class C license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 2,000 plants, (b) a “marihuana processor” license, (c) a “secure transporter” license, (d) a “marihuana retailer” license, (e) a “marihuana safety compliance facility” license, and (f) a “marihuana microbusiness” license. However, MRTMA also allows the MRA to create additional license types through the administrative rulemaking process. To date, the MRA has created four additional license types: (a) a “designated consumption establishment” license, (b) an “excess marihuana grower” license, (c) a “marihuana event organizer” license, and (d) a “temporary marihuana event” license. Importantly, each excess marihuana grower license allows an entity that holds five adult use Class C grower licenses issued under MRTMA and at least two medical Class C grower licenses issued under the MMFLA to grow an additional 2,000 plants. Under both MRTMA and the MMFLA, there are no stated limits on the number of licenses that can be made available on a state level; however, the MRA has discretion over the approval of applications and municipalities can pass additional restrictions, including limiting the number and type of licenses that can be issued within their jurisdiction. Additionally, a person or entity cannot possess or own both a grower/process/provisioning center and a secure transporter license or a safety compliance lab. On February 11, 2022, Governor Whitmer signed an Executive Reorganization Order (ERO) 2022-1 which modified the Marijuana Regulatory Agency (MRA) to be called the Cannabis Regulatory Agency (CRA). This allowed for the CRA to have authority over Michigan's hemp processors and handlers under the Industrial Hemp Research and Development Act also shifting to the new CRA. U.S. Hemp Regime The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law on December 20, 2018. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removed “hemp” (including any part of the cannabis plant containing 0.3% THC or less), its extracts, derivatives, and cannabinoids from the CSA definition of “marihuana”, and allows for federally-sanctioned hemp production under the purview of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), in coordination with state departments of agriculture that elect to have primary regulatory authority. States and Tribal governments can adopt their own regulatory plans, even if more restrictive than federal regulations, so long as the plans meet minimum federal standards and are approved by the USDA. Hemp production in jurisdictions that do not choose to submit their own plans (and that do not otherwise prohibit hemp production) will be governed by USDA regulation. “Hemp” as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, “means the plant Cannabis sativa L., and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.” 20 While the 2018 Farm Bill removes hemp and hemp-derived products from the controlled substances list under the CSA, it does not legalize cannabidiol (“CBD”) in every circumstance. While not independently scheduled under the CSA, CBD, depending on the source from which it was derived and its THC concentration, can still be classified as a Schedule I substance under the CSA’s definition of “marihuana.” Further, although the 2018 Farm Bill creates a limited exception to this prohibition, this exception only applies if the CBD is derived from “hemp” as defined in federal law. Federal law also requires that: (i) the hemp is produced by a Licensed Producer; and (ii) in a manner consistent with the applicable federal and state regulations. CBD and other cannabinoids produced from marihuana as defined by the CSA remain an illegal Schedule I substance under federal law. In addition, many state laws include all CBD within definitions of marijuana and some states have policies or laws that otherwise prohibit or restrict CBD sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2018 Farm Bill expressly preserves the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate certain products under the FDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA takes the position that because CBD was the subject of substantial clinical investigations that have been made public and is the active ingredient in an FDA-approved drug (Epidiolex), it is therefore illegal to add to food and CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition. While there is an exception for articles that were marketed as a conventional food or dietary supplement before the new drug investigations were authorized (or the new drug was approved), the FDA has asserted that, based on available evidence, the exception does not apply to CBD. As previously mentioned, the FDA takes the position that it is unlawful under the FDCA to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, or to market CBD products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Despite FDA’s stated position, the agency has not, to date, been active in its CBD-related enforcement absent CBD products bearing aggressive therapeutic claims (e.g., claims of treatment of COVID-19, neuropathy, AIDS, diabetes, cancer, etc.). FDA could change its enforcement priorities at any time. The FDA has indicated that it will work towards providing ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market CBD products. In addition, options remain available for the FDA to consider whether there are circumstances in which certain cannabis-derived compounds might be permitted in a food or dietary supplement. Importantly, notwithstanding the FDA’s stated position prohibiting sales of CBD containing-foods and dietary supplements, the FDA has authority to issue a regulation allowing the use of a pharmaceutical ingredient, such as CBD, in a food or dietary supplement, even if such pharmaceutical ingredient was not previously marketed as a food or dietary ingredient prior to the initiation of clinical drug trials. Timing regarding if or when FDA might issue such a regulation is unclear. States have also taken various approaches to the production and sale of hemp-derived food products. Many states have adopted the Uniform State Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which was created in 1984 by the Association of Food and Drug Officials (the “AFDO”), the primary organization for state food and drug officials. The AFDO’s model Uniform Act includes a provision to automatically incorporate changes to the FDCA into state law. However, there is some variation between state Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Acts both because not all states have adopted this provision, and because not all states have adopted the Uniform Act. States that have adopted the Uniform Act generally prohibit the use of CBD in food and dietary supplements due to the FDA’s lack of approval for such uses of the substance, discussed above. For example, Michigan (among other states) prohibits the use of CBD in retail food and beverage products because of the FDA’s stated position. Like FDA, some states, despite having stated positions of the impermissibility of CBD foods and supplements, or any CBD products at all, enforcement is inconsistent, with some state regulators more active than others. Again, these enforcement priorities could change at any time. Although hemp-derived CBD cannot be added or marketed in foods or dietary supplements, certain hemp derived substances, such as hemp seed oil, may be permissible in food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and other products depending on whether the ingredients and finished products comply with the other requirements of the FDCA. For example, a substance that will be added to food is subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless it is generally recognized, among qualified experts, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use (“GRAS”). Pursuant to the FDCA, a food ingredient may be marketed in the United States under any of the following three alternative criteria: (i) if it was approved by the FDA or USDA between 1938 and 1958 for the intended use (commonly referred to as a “prior sanction”); (ii) if it is GRAS for its intended use; or (iii) pursuant to a food additive regulation promulgated by the FDA. On December 20, 2018, the FDA issued GRAS approvals for three ingredients that are derived from parts of the cannabis plant that do not contain THC or CBD – hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein, and hemp seed oil. These three types of products can be legally marketed in human foods without food additive approval, provided they comply with all other requirements and do not make unlawful drug claims. It is worth noting that none of these GRAS products contain CBD. The 2018 Farm Bill also contemplates a significant state presence in the regulation of hemp production, as the 2018 Farm Bill empowers states, U.S. territories and Native American tribes to regulate the production and sale of hemp within their respective borders. To regulate commercial hemp production, states, U.S. territories and Native American tribes must submit plans to the USDA setting out the processes associated with how the state, territory or tribe will regulate hemp production, including how it will gather information, test, inspect and dispose of hemp and its related byproducts. The Secretary of the USDA must approve or reject these plans within sixty days of receipt. If a state, territory or tribe chooses not to submit a plan to the USDA, potential producers will be able to apply directly to the USDA for licensing approval. States, territories and tribes may also 21 enact stricter laws than those enacted at the federal level and may ban hemp production and sale within their respective jurisdiction. Once implemented, in jurisdictions with USDA-approved state programs, it will be a violation of state law to cultivate hemp without a registration in compliance with state law, or in the case of a state or territory without a USDA-approved program, it will be a violation of federal law to cultivate hemp without a federally issued license. The 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law on December 20, 2018. Importantly, however, the Industrial Hemp cultivation and research provisions contained in the Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Bill”) will remain in effect pending the USDA’s rulemaking process and certain provisions of the law may not yet be effective. The federal rulemaking process may take more than one year to finalize, and the 2014 Farm Bill will be repealed one year after the USDA establishes regulations governing hemp production in states lacking their own USDA-approved plans. The scope of the 2014 Farm Bill is limited to cultivation that is: (i) for research purposes (inclusive of market research, which multiple federal agencies have confirmed includes commercial sales with a research purpose); (ii) part of an “agricultural pilot program” or other agricultural or academic research; and (iii) permitted by state law. Further, the 2014 Farm Bill defines “Industrial Hemp” as the plant Cannabis sativa L., and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. The USDA published its final rule on January 19, 2021. The USDA’s final rule establishes a federal licensing plan for regulating U.S. hemp producers in states that do not have their own USDA-approved plans. In the absence of a state plan, U.S. hemp producers will be subject to regulation directly by the USDA unless the state prohibits U.S. hemp production. Additionally, the final rule includes requirements for maintaining information on the land where US hemp is produced, testing U.S. hemp for THC levels, disposing of plants with more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry-weight basis and licensing for U.S. hemp producers. The USDA’s final rule requires hemp producers to use a laboratory that is registered with the DEA, although the USDA is delaying enforcement of this requirement until December 31, 2022. The final rule also includes provisions for producers to dispose or remediate violative hemp plants without the use of a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement. State-Level Overview The following section presents an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the hemp industry in Florida, where the Company has an operating presence as of the date of this filing. Florida Florida continues to classify all cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, except medical marijuana grown and sold under the state’s medical marijuana program and, as of July 1, 2019, both hemp and industrial hemp. Florida defines “cannabis” in its criminal code to include, “all parts of any plant of the genus cannabis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant or its seeds or resin.” The term does not include “marijuana,” if manufactured, possessed, sold, purchased, delivered, distributed, or dispensed, in conformance with § 381.986 Florida’s Medical Marijuana Program statutes. This term also does not include “hemp” defined in § 581.217 or “industrial hemp” as defined in § 1004.4473. On May 3, 2019, the Florida legislature passed SB1020, creating Florida’s hemp farming program governed by the Florida Department of Agriculture, legalizing cannabidiol and the sale and distribution of hemp extracts, and removing hemp and industrial hemp from the definition of cannabis under state law so that hemp is no longer a controlled substance in the state of Florida. On June 25, 2019, the bill was signed by the governor and went into on effect July 1, 2019. On April 16, 2020, Florida’s Hemp Plan was approved by USDA. Hemp cultivators may now apply for licensure online with the Florida Department of Agriculture. As part of the application, hemp cultivators must undergo a background check and must submit a Hemp Containment and Transportation Plan, among other requirements. Regulatory Framework in Canada Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Canada The TerrAscend Canada Licensed Producer License TerrAscend Canada held a standard cultivation license, standard processing license and license for sale for medical purposes under the Cannabis Act until February 9, 2023 when it opted to return its license. Under the Licensed Producer License, and subject to further requirements set out in the Cannabis Act, TerrAscend Canada was able to possess, obtain produce and sell cannabis, including sales of cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles, and oils, in accordance with the applicable Cannabis Regulations, subject to certain terms and conditions. 22 The Cookies Canada License TerrAscend's minority-owned business, Cookies Canada, has an interest in a retail operator's license under the Cannabis License Act (Ontario). The retail operator's license permits, subject to further requirements set out in the legislation, to possess and sell cannabis, including sales of cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles, and oils, in accordance with the applicable legislation and regulation, subject to certain terms and conditions, subject to certain restrictions on age and time of sale. Summary of Canadian Regulatory Framework On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations came into force as law with the effect of legalizing the recreational adult-use of cannabis and regulating the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and cannabis derived products (both medical and adult-use) within Canada. The Cannabis Act replaced the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) and the Old International Health Regulations (“IHR”), both of which came into force under the CDSA, which previously permitted access to cannabis for medical purposes for only those Canadians who had been authorized to use cannabis by their health care practitioner. The Cannabis Act provides a licensing and permitting scheme for activities related to cannabis, implemented by regulations made under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Act maintains separate medical access to cannabis, including providing that import and export licenses and permits will only be issued in respect of cannabis for medical or scientific purposes or in respect of industrial hemp. Transitional provisions of the Cannabis Act provide that licenses and permits issued under the former ACMPR and the Narcotics Control Regulations (“NCR”) that were in force immediately before the day on which the Cannabis Act came into force are deemed to continue under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Regulations (the “Regulations”), among other things, outline the rules for the legal cultivation, processing, research, testing, distribution, sale, importation and exportation of cannabis and hemp in Canada, including the various classes of licenses that can be granted, and set standards for cannabis and hemp products. The Regulations include strict specifications for the plain packaging and labelling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed production and processing sites. The Cannabis Act and Regulations were amended on October 17, 2019 to provide for new classes of cannabis, namely edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals, that are permitted to be sold in the medical and adult-use markets as well as to establish new regulatory controls to address the public health and safety risks associated with these new classes of cannabis. These controls include restrictions on product composition and ingredients, THC limits, and new requirements pertaining to promotion, packaging and labelling, good production practices and record keeping. Pursuant to the Cannabis Act, subject to provincial regulations, individuals over the age of 18 are able to purchase fresh cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis oil, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals, edible cannabis and cannabis plants or seeds and are able to legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis or equivalent. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides provincial, territorial and municipal governments the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retailing and distribution, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements of the Cannabis Act such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption, and limiting the ability of households to grow cannabis plants. The Cannabis Regulations establish requirements relating to licenses; security, including clearances; cannabis products; packaging, labelling and promotion, health products and cosmetics containing cannabis and cannabis for medical purposes. Cannabis Products Initially, the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations set out certain requirements for the sale of cannabis products at the retail level and initially permitted the sale of dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in “pre-rolled” and capsule form, by authorized license holders. On October 17, 2019, the Federal Government legalized new classes of products; specifically, edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products pursuant to certain amendments to the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations. The previous class, cannabis oil, was subject to a one year transition period to allow for existing cannabis license holders to transition their current products in order to comply with the amended Cannabis Regulations. Consequently, the Cannabis Act was amended with effect on October 17, 2020 to remove “cannabis oil” as a separate cannabis category from Schedule 4 of the Cannabis Act. Edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products, which are now available for sale, are subject to additional regulatory requirements that include supplemental marketing and advertising rules, further restrictions on labelling and packaging, rules relating to ingredients of edible cannabis and cannabis extracts, limits on THC content, and additional 23 manufacturing and good production practice requirements. In addition, the Cannabis Regulations require processing license holders to notify Health Canada at least sixty days prior to the intended release of a new product to the market. Advertising and Promotions The Cannabis Act, and the accompanying Cannabis Regulations, the Cannabis Licence Act (Ontario) and its accompanying regulations, contain strict restrictions on the promotion of cannabis products and generally prohibit the promotion of cannabis, cannabis accessories and services related to cannabis, unless the promotional activity is specifically authorized under the legislation and regulations. These prohibitions are intended to protect public health and safety, including protecting the health of young persons by restricting their access to cannabis and preventing the inducement of the use of cannabis, while allowing consumers to have access to information with which they can make informed decisions about the consumption of cannabis. Thus, the promotion, packaging and labelling, display and sale and distribution of cannabis and cannabis accessories takes place in a highly regulated environment which restricts the ability of operators to brand and market their store or products in a manner consistent with other industries which are not subject to such controls. Provincial and Territorial Developments While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the Federal Government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis and the sale of medical cannabis, it also provides that the provinces and territories of Canada have authority to regulate certain aspects of adult-use cannabis, such as distribution and sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters. The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented their regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age of 19 years old, except for Alberta, where the minimum age is 18, and Québec, where the minimum age is 21. A summary of the legislative framework in each province and territory is set out below. Ontario The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Ontario is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act, 2017, the Cannabis Licence Act, 2018 and the related regulations. The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation is the wholesale distributor of cannabis and conducts all online sales in the province. Compliance In the United States, TerrAscend is in compliance with all state laws and the related cannabis licensing framework of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. In Canada, at the time of license return at the request of TerrAscend, TerrAscend was in compliance with all applicable federal, provincial and territorial laws and regulations, including the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations. There are no current incidences of noncompliance, citations or notices of violations outstanding which may have an impact on TerrAscend’s licenses, business activities or operations in these states. Notwithstanding the foregoing, like all businesses, TerrAscend may from time-to-time experience incidences of noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations in the states in which TerrAscend operates, and such non-compliance may have an impact on TerrAscend’s licenses, business activities or operations in the applicable states. However, TerrAscend takes steps to minimize, disclose and remedy all incidences of non-compliance which may have an impact on TerrAscend’s licenses, business activities or operations in all states in which TerrAscend operates.

RISK FACTORS The following risks should be carefully considered when deciding whether to make an investment in TerrAscend. Some of the following factors are interrelated and, consequently, investors and readers should treat such risk factors as a whole. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones that could affect TerrAscend, and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to TerrAscend, or that it currently considers not to be material, may also impair the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend and/or the value of its securities. If any of the following risks or other risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend business, financial condition and results of operations and/or the value of TerrAscend’s securities. There is no assurance that any risk management steps taken by TerrAscend will avoid future loss due to the occurrence of the risks described below, or other unforeseen risks. Regulatory and Legal Risks to TerrAscend’s Business and the Cannabis Industry There is a substantial risk of regulatory or political change with respect to cannabis, which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business. In the United States, the operations of TerrAscend and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of laws, including, among other things, state and local regulations and guidelines relating to the cultivation, manufacture, management, transportation, distribution, sale, storage and disposal of cannabis. Changes to such laws, regulations and guidelines due to matters beyond the control of TerrAscend may cause adverse effects to TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and result of operations. Local, state and federal laws and regulations governing cannabis for medicinal and recreational purposes are broad in control and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require TerrAscend to incur substantial costs associated with bringing TerrAscendʼs operations into compliance. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt TerrAscendʼs operations and result in a material adverse effect on its financial performance. It is beyond TerrAscendʼs scope to predict the nature of any future change to the existing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations or applications, nor can TerrAscend determine what effect such changes, when and if promulgated, could have on TerrAscendʼs business. The Cannabis Act came into force in Canada on October 17, 2018 along with various related regulations. The cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of cannabis, among other things, remains subject to extensive regulatory oversight under the Cannabis Act. It is possible that these statutory requirements, including any new regulations that are subsequently issued, could significantly and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. While the foregoing activities in respect of cannabis are under the regulatory oversight of the Government of Canada, the distribution of recreational use cannabis is the responsibility of the respective provincial and territorial governments. These jurisdictions have chosen varying retail frameworks with private, public and hybrid models being implemented. There is no guarantee that provincial and territorial legislation regulating the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes will be continued according to their current terms, that they will not be materially amended or that such regimes will create the growth opportunities that TerrAscend currently anticipates. In addition, government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the cannabis industry in Canada, the United States or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public’s perception of medical or recreational cannabis in Canada, the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, a shift could cause state and local jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical or recreational cannabis, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which TerrAscend could expand. Any inability to fully implement TerrAscendʼs expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with regulations regarding cannabis is difficult, because the regulation of cannabis is uncertain and frequently changes. TerrAscend's failure to comply with applicable laws regarding cannabis may adversely affect TerrAscend's business. Achievement of TerrAscendʼs business objectives is contingent, in part, upon compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by governmental authorities and obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the sale of its products. TerrAscend cannot predict the impact of the compliance regime that the applicable regulatory bodies in the United States and Canada are implementing that effect the business of TerrAscend. Similarly, TerrAscend cannot predict the time required to secure all appropriate regulatory approvals for its products, or the extent of testing and documentation that may be required by governmental authorities. The impact of governmental compliance regimes, any delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. 25 TerrAscend will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions on TerrAscendʼs operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to TerrAscendʼs operations, result in increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. The cannabis industry is subject to extensive controls and regulations, which may significantly affect the financial condition of market participants. The marketability of any product may be affected by numerous factors that are beyond the control of TerrAscend and which cannot be predicted, such as changes to government regulations, including those relating to taxes and other government levies which may be imposed. Changes in government levies, including taxes, could reduce TerrAscendʼs earnings and could make future capital investments or TerrAscendʼs operations uneconomic. The industry is also subject to numerous legal challenges, which may significantly affect the financial condition of market participants and which cannot be reliably predicted. TerrAscend’s business relies heavily on its ability to obtain and maintain required licenses, and failure to do so may adversely affect TerrAscend’s business. TerrAscendʼs ability to grow, store and sell medical and adult-use cannabis in certain U.S. states and Canada is dependent on TerrAscend maintaining licenses with applicable regulators for the production and sale of cannabis. Failure to comply with the requirements of its licenses or any failure to maintain its licenses would have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and operating results of TerrAscend. TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, as applicable, will apply for, as the need arises, all necessary licenses and permits to carry on the activities it expects to conduct in the future. However, the ability of TerrAscend or its subsidiaries to obtain, maintain or renew any such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to changes in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable authorities or other governmental agencies in each respective jurisdictions. In certain states, the cannabis laws and regulations limit, not only the number of cannabis licenses issued, but also the number of cannabis licenses that one person may own. TerrAscend believes that, where such restrictions apply, it may still capture significant share of revenue in the market through wholesale sales, exclusive marketing relations, provision of management or support services, franchising and similar arrangement with other operators. Nevertheless, such limitations on the acquisition of ownership of additional licenses within certain states or enforcement by regulators in certain states against such services arrangements may limit TerrAscendʼs ability to grow organically or to increase its market share in such states. As a cannabis business, TerrAscend is subject to unfavorable tax treatment under the U.S. federal income tax law. Tax risk is the risk of changes in the tax environment that would have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, results of operations, and financial condition. Currently, U.S. state licensed marijuana businesses are assessed a comparatively high effective U.S. federal income tax rate due to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), which prohibits businesses from deducting certain expenses associated with trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the CSA). The Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") has invoked Section 280E of the Code in tax audits against various cannabis businesses in the United States that are permitted under applicable U.S. state laws. Although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of certain expenses, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. While there are currently several pending cases before various U.S. administrative and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E of the Code favorable to cannabis businesses. Given these facts, the impact of any such challenges cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be significant to the financial condition and/or the overall operations of TerrAscend. If TerrAscend’s tax positions were to be challenged by U.S. federal, state, or local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, TerrAscend' may not be wholly successful in defending its tax filing positions. TerrAscend records reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on its assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining TerrAscend’s tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If TerrAscend’s tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts, or TerrAscend may be required to reduce the carrying amount of its net deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to TerrAscend’s financial condition or results of operations. If TerrAscend is or becomes a “passive foreign investment company,” its U.S. investors may suffer adverse tax consequences. 26 Generally, for any taxable year, if at least 75% of TerrAscend’s gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the value of TerrAscend’s assets (generally determined based on a weighted quarterly average) is attributable to assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income, TerrAscend will be a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of these tests, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, certain gains from the sale of investment property, and certain rents and royalties, and passive assets generally include cash. Additionally, TerrAscend generally will be treated as directly holding and receiving its proportionate share of the assets and income, respectively, of any corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 25% of its stock by value. If TerrAscend is a PFIC for any taxable year, certain U.S. investors may suffer adverse tax consequences, including ineligibility for preferential tax rates on capital gains or dividends, interest charges on certain taxes treated as deferred, and additional tax reporting requirements. TerrAscend’s PFIC status generally will depend on the nature and composition of TerrAscend’s income and assets and the value of TerrAscend’s assets (which generally will be determined based on the fair market value of each asset, with the value of goodwill determined in large part by reference to the market value of TerrAscend’s stock from time to time, which may be volatile). If TerrAscend’s market capitalization declines while it holds a substantial amount of cash for any taxable year, TerrAscend may be a PFIC for such taxable year. The manner and timeframe in which TerrAscend spends the cash it raises in any offering, the transactions it enters into, and how TerrAscend’s corporate structure may change in the future will affect the nature and composition of TerrAscend’s income and assets. Based on the nature and composition of TerrAscend’s income and assets and the value of TerrAscend’s assets, including goodwill, TerrAscend believes that it was not a PFIC for its taxable year ended December 31, 2022. Because PFIC determination is a factual determination made annually after the end of each taxable year by applying principles and methodologies that in some circumstances are unclear and subject to varying interpretation, there can be no assurance that TerrAscend will not be a PFIC for any taxable year, and TerrAscend’s U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to TerrAscend’s PFIC status for any taxable year. U.S. investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules’ impact in their particular circumstances. If TerrAscend is a PFIC for any taxable year, the tax consequences that would apply if U.S. investors were able to make a valid “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”) election. At this time, TerrAscend does not expect to provide U.S. investors with the information necessary for them to make a QEF election if TerrAscend is a PFIC for any taxable year. U.S. investors should assume that a QEF election will not be available with respect to TerrAscend’s stock. If TerrAscend (or any of its non-U.S. subsidiaries) is a “controlled foreign corporation,” certain of its U.S. investors may suffer adverse tax consequences. If a “United States person” for U.S. federal income tax purposes is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the total value or total combined voting power of TerrAscend’s stock, such person may be treated as a “United States shareholder” with respect to each “controlled foreign corporation” (“CFC”) in TerrAscend’s group (if any). A non-U.S. corporation will be a CFC if United States shareholders own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) more than 50% of the total value or total combined voting power of the stock of the non-U.S. corporation. Because TerrAscend’s group includes one or more U.S. corporate subsidiaries, certain of its current or future non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries may be treated as CFCs (regardless of whether TerrAscend is treated as a CFC). A United States shareholder of a CFC may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of the CFC’s “Subpart F income,” “global intangible low-taxed income,” and investments of earnings in U.S. property (regardless of whether the CFC makes any distributions to its shareholders). Additionally, an individual United States shareholder with respect to a CFC generally will not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate United States shareholder. A failure to comply with CFC reporting obligations may subject a United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and prevent the statute of limitations from running with respect to the United States shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year in which reporting was due. There can be no assurance that TerrAscend will assist its U.S. investors in determining whether it (or any of its current or future non-U.S. subsidiaries) is treated as a CFC or whether such U.S. investors are treated as United States shareholders with respect to any such CFC, or that TerrAscend will furnish to any such United States shareholders information that may be necessary to comply with their CFC reporting and tax paying obligations. U.S. investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the CFC rules’ impact in their particular circumstances. TerrAscend’s ability to use its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards to offset its future U.S. taxable income may be subject to limitations. TerrAscend’s U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) generated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 may be carried forward for 20 years. TerrAscend’s U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the utilization of such NOLs is limited. In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its stock ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change U.S. federal NOLs to offset its future U.S. taxable income. If TerrAscend has undergone an ownership change in the past, or if future 27 changes in its stock ownership, some of which are outside its control, results in an ownership change, its ability to utilize its U.S. federal NOLs may be limited by Section 382 of the Code. It is uncertain if and to what extent U.S. states will conform to U.S. federal income tax law with respect to the treatment of NOLs. As a result, TerrAscend’s ability to use its U.S. NOLs to offset its future U.S. taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could increase its tax liability and decrease its cash flow. Tax and accounting requirements may change or be interpreted in ways that are unforeseen to TerrAscend, and TerrAscend may face difficulty or be unable to implement and/or comply with any such changes or interpretations. TerrAscend is subject to numerous tax and accounting requirements, and changes in existing rules or practices, varying interpretations of current rules or practices, or enactments of new rules or practices could have a significant adverse effect on TerrAscend’s financial results, the manner in which TerrAscend conducts its business, or the marketability of any of TerrAscend’s products. For instance, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act imposes, among other rules, a 15% minimum tax on the book income of certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. In many countries, including the U.S., TerrAscend is subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly. Although TerrAscend believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, it is subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit its transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed or that various jurisdictions could assert that TerrAscend should file tax returns in jurisdictions where it does not file and subject it to additional tax. In the future, the geographic scope of TerrAscend’s business may expand, and such expansion will require TerrAscend to comply with the tax laws and regulations of additional jurisdictions. Requirements as to taxation vary substantially among jurisdictions. Complying with the tax laws and regulations of these jurisdictions can be time-consuming and expensive and could potentially subject TerrAscend to penalties and fees in the future if it failed to comply. In the event that TerrAscend failed to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, and enforcement of cannabis laws could change. TerrAscend may be subject to action by the U.S. federal government due to its involvement with cannabis, and such action could materially adversely affect TerrAscend’s business. While some states in the United States have authorized the use and sale of cannabis in some form, it remains illegal under US federal law. On January 4, 2018, then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum to U.S. Attorneys which rescinded previous guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice specific to cannabis enforcement in the United States, including the Cole Memorandum, which stated that the U.S. Department of Justice would not prioritize the prosecution of cannabis-related violations of U.S. federal law in jurisdictions that had enacted laws legalizing medical cannabis in some form and had implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems. With the Cole Memorandum rescinded, U.S. federal prosecutors have greater discretion in determining whether to prosecute medical cannabis-related violations of U.S. federal law; there was never such a policy statement in relation to U.S. state and territories with adult use cannabis programs. Because TerrAscend engages in cannabis-related activities in the United States, an increase in federal enforcement efforts with respect to current U.S. federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause financial damage to TerrAscend. In addition, TerrAscend is at risk of being prosecuted under U.S. federal law and having its assets seized. TerrAscendʼs exposure to U.S. cannabis related activities are as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Current assets 98,704 82,328 Non-current assets 577,659 407,675 Current liabilities 124,777 61,255 Non-current liabilities 215,605 164,977 For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Revenue, net 246,571 190,847 125,207 Gross profit (loss) 100,941 110,783 85,520 Income (loss) from operations (4,994 ) 26,503 38,702 Net loss attributable to controlling interest (322,461 ) (2,506 ) (5,582 ) Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the U.S. federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities, civil forfeiture or 28 divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for TerrAscend to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. Unlike in Canada which has federal legislation uniformly governing the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act, investors are cautioned that in the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a controlled substance under the CSA in the United States and as such, is in violation of federal law in the United States. Further, there can be no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. It is also important to note that local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the distribution of cannabis in a manner that will make it extremely difficult or impossible to transact business in the cannabis industry. As stated above, Congress has passed appropriations bills each of the last several years, since 2014, to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. Most recently, on September 30, 2021 and December 3, 2021, President Biden signed short-term continuing resolutions to extend current appropriations, most recently through February 18, 2022. The continuing resolution contains, among other things, the RBA, which prevents the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state medical cannabis laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has construed these appropriations bills to prevent the federal government from prosecuting individuals when those individuals comply with state medical cannabis laws, and has vacated numerous convictions and sent the cases back to the trial courts for further determination. However, because this conduct continues to violate federal law, American courts have observed that should Congress at any time choose to appropriate funds to fully prosecute the CSA, any individual or business—even those that have fully complied with state law—could be prosecuted for violations of federal law. If Congress restores funding, for example by declining to include the RBA in a budget resolution, or by failing to pass necessary budget legislation and causing another government shutdown, the government will have the authority to prosecute individuals for violations of the law before it lacked funding under the five-year statute of limitations applicable to non-capital CSA violations. Additionally, it is important to note that the appropriations protections only apply to medical cannabis operations and provide no protection against businesses operating in compliance with a state’s recreational cannabis laws. The Department of Justice or a federal prosecutor could allege that TerrAscend and TerrAscend’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”) and, potentially its shareholders, “aided and abetted” violations of federal law by providing finances and services to its operating subsidiaries. Under these circumstances, it is possible that a federal prosecutor would seek to seize the assets of TerrAscend and to recover the “illicit profits” previously distributed to shareholders resulting from any of the foregoing financing or services. In these circumstances, TerrAscend’s operations could cease, TerrAscend securityholders may lose their entire investment and directors, officers and/or TerrAscend shareholders may be left to defend any criminal charges against them at their own expense and, if convicted, be sent to federal prison. Violations of any federal laws could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its holding (directly or indirectly) of cannabis licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on any securities exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its listed securities. An investor’s contribution to and involvement in TerrAscend’s activities may result in federal civil and/or criminal prosecution, including forfeiture of his, her or its entire investment. Although the 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, generally removes hemp from the controlled substances list under the CSA, it does not legalize CBD generally. In particular, the 2018 Farm Bill preserves the FDAʼs authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. Pursuant to a statement released December 20, 2018, Frequently Asked Questions on the FDAʼs website, and numerous public statements, the FDA has taken the position that all CBD is a drug ingredient and therefore illegal to add to food or health products without its approval or further action by the FDA. The FDA considers products containing CBD or other cannabis-derived compounds the same as any other FDA-regulated products and takes the position that they are subject to the same authorities and requirements as similarly regulated products, including but not limited to required approvals for food ingredients and dietary supplements based on safety standards. Importantly, the FDA has taken the position that it is unlawful under the FDCA to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, 29 or to market CBD products as, or in, food or dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp derived. The FDA has however indicated that it will work towards providing ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market CBD products. Further, many state criminal laws and food and drug laws prohibit or restrict the production and/or sale of hemp-derived CBD products. TerrAscendʼs U.S. hemp operations will be subject to FDA oversight. There is no guarantee that TerrAscend will be able to obtain necessary approval from regulatory authorities for its products in the United States. TerrAscendʼs activities and operations in the United States are, and will continue to be, subject to evolving regulation by governmental authorities. The approach to the enforcement of cannabis laws may be subject to change or may not proceed as previously outlined. The USDA will promulgate additional rules governing the production of hemp in the United States, with many states in the process of amending state laws to regulate hemp production and the sale of hemp-derived products within their borders. In addition, the FDA is expected to make determinations as to how CBD products will be regulated and is expected to issue a substantial change in its regulation of dietary supplements generally. Accordingly, there are significant changes in both federal and state law that may materially impact TerrAscendʼs operations. TerrAscend’s business is subject to applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations and have restricted access to capital markets, banking and other financial services, which may adversely affect TerrAscend’s business. Since the use of cannabis is currently illegal under U.S. federal law, and in light of considerations related to money laundering and other cannabis related criminality in the U.S. banking industry, U.S. banks have been reluctant to accept or deposit funds from businesses involved with the cannabis industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding banks willing to accept its business. Likewise, cannabis businesses have limited access, if any, to credit card processing services. As a result, cannabis businesses in the United States are largely cash-based. This complicates the implementation of financial controls and increases security issues. While TerrAscend is not able to obtain financing in the United States from traditional banks or other U.S. federally regulated entities, TerrAscend has been able to access equity financing through private markets in both the United States and Canada. Commercial banks, private equity firms, and venture capital firms have approached the cannabis industry cautiously to date. However, there are increasing numbers of high-net-worth individuals and family offices that have made meaningful investments in companies and businesses similar to TerrAscend. There is neither a broad nor deep pool of institutional capital that is available to cannabis license holders and license applicants. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if raised privately, will be available to TerrAscend when needed or on terms which are acceptable to TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs inability to raise financing to fund its operations, capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit its growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. Under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act, financial transactions in the United States involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution. The FinCEN division of the U.S. Department of Treasury has provided guidance for how financial institutions can provide services to the cannabis-related businesses consistent with the obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Previously, DOJ directed its federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memorandum when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon cannabis-related activity. In January 2018, the DOJ revoked the Cole Memorandum and related memorandum. While the impact remains unclear, the revocation has created uncertainty. For instance, federal prosecutors may increase enforcement activities against institutions or individuals who are engaged in financial transactions related to cannabis activities, or there may be a negative impact to the continuation of financial services in the United States with regard to cannabis-related activities. Consequently, businesses involved in the regulated cannabis industry may experience difficulties establishing banking relationships, and such difficulties may increase over time. If TerrAscend were to experience any inability to access financial services in the United States, including its current bank accounts, this would have a direct impact on the ability for TerrAscend to operate its businesses. This impact would increase TerrAscendʼs operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical, and security challenges that could impede its inability to implement its business plans. The U.S. federal prohibitions on the sale of cannabis may result in TerrAscend and its partners being restricted from accessing the U.S. banking system and they may be unable to deposit funds in federally insured and licensed banking institutions. Banking restrictions could be imposed due to TerrAscendʼs banking institutions not accepting payments and deposits. TerrAscend is at risk that any bank accounts it has could be closed at any time. Such risks increase costs to TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs activities in the United States, and any proceeds thereof, may be considered proceeds of crime due to the fact that cannabis remains federally illegal in the United States. This may restrict the ability of TerrAscend to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or subsequently repatriate such funds back to Canada. Furthermore, while TerrAscend has no current intention to declare or pay dividends on its Common Shares in the foreseeable future, TerrAscend may decide or be required to suspend declaring or paying dividends without advance notice and for an indefinite period of time. The guidance provided in the FinCEN 30 Memorandum as described above may change depended on the position of the U.S. government administration at any given time and is subject to revision or retraction in the future, which may restrict TerrAscendʼs access to banking services. TerrAscend operates in a highly regulated sector and may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where TerrAscend carries on business, which could negatively affect TerrAscend’s business. Given the complexity of the U.S. regulation of the cannabis industry, certain requirements may prove to be excessively onerous or otherwise impractical for TerrAscend to comply with. This may result in the exclusion of certain business opportunities from the list of possible transactions that TerrAscend would otherwise consider. Further, U.S. laws and regulations at the local, state, and federal levels which apply to the cannabis industry are continually changing, and it is difficult to determine if future changes could detrimentally affect the operations of TerrAscend. Given the broad scope of cannabis laws and regulations, these are subject to evolving interpretations. This continued evolution could require TerrAscend to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt TerrAscendʼs businesses and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. TerrAscendʼs continued compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by government authorities and obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the sale of its products, including maintain and renewing all applicable licenses, is crucial to the successful execution of TerrAscendʼs strategies. The commercial cannabis industry is an emerging industry in the United States, and TerrAscend cannot forecast the impact of the compliance regime to which they will be subject. Similarly, TerrAscend cannot predict its ability to secure all appropriate regulatory approvals for any of its products, or the extent of testing or related documentation that may be required by governmental authorities. Delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and operating results of TerrAscend. Without limiting the foregoing, TerrAscendʼs failure to comply with the requirements of any underlying licenses or any failure to maintain any underlying licenses would have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, and operating results. It is uncertain whether any required licenses for the operation of TerrAscendʼs business will be extended or renewed in a timely manner, if at all, or that if they are extended or renewed, that the licenses will be extended or renewed on the same or similar terms. Furthermore, Internet websites are visible by people everywhere, not just in jurisdiction where the activities described therein are considered legal. As a result, to the extent that TerrAscend sells services or products via web-based links targeting only jurisdictions in which such sales or services are compliant with state law, TerrAscend may face legal action in other jurisdictions which are not the intended object of any of TerrAscend's marketing efforts for engaging in any web-based activity that results in sales into such jurisdictions deemed illegal under applicable laws. Regulatory restrictions on ownership outside of the control of TerrAscend may have a material adverse impact on TerrAscend's operations in certain markets TerrAscend's business is subject to oversight by regulators in each market that TerrAscend operates in. Regulators may limit the type or number of licenses that a single company may own. As a result, TerrAscend may be restricted from participating in certain cannabis businesses in specific markets as a result of ownership or control of other cannabis licenses. As an example, certain markets may limit the size of a company's cultivation space, limit the number of dispensaries a single-company may own, or may obligate a company to offer certain products, like medical cannabis, to consumers. TerrAscend faces further risk associated with restrictions on licenses as a result of TerrAscend's inability to control public company shareholder ownership, and therefore TerrAscend may inadvertently have certain restrictions placed on its ability to operate as a result of third-party ownership. Restrictions placed on TerrAscend's ability to own specific licenses or assets in specific markets, or complexities arising from third-party ownership thresholds may materially adversely impact TerrAscend's ability to compete in a specific market or may cause other regulatory delays in receiving regulatory approval for certain activities. Failure to comply with privacy or medical practice laws and regulations may result in impacts to operations, monetary fines or litigation TerrAscend maintains an array of sensitive information, including confidential business and personal information in connection with our operations, and are subject to laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of such information. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we may be affected by or subject to new, amended or existing laws and regulations in the future, including as our operations continue to expand and we operate in additional markets. Each market 31 may be subject to differing laws or legal interpretations, which adds to the complexity of collecting, using, disclosing and processing personal data, and emerging cannabis markets may make changes to their legal frameworks. In the United States, there are numerous federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information, including federal and state health information privacy laws, federal and state security breach notification laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations and constantly evolving. While the United States lacks a nationwide privacy law of general applicability, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) imposes privacy and security requirements and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the US Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. In addition, provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act require confidential treatment of employee medical records. In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act (Canada) (“PIPEDA”) and comparable legislation at the provincial level, governs the treatment of private information held by a corporation. Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has stated that it considers the personal information of cannabis users is to be considered sensitive. Canadian privacy jurisprudence regarding the obligations that private sector organizations have to individual data subjects is constantly evolving. Privacy laws in Canada are also changing at the legislative level. On November 17, 2020, the Canadian Federal Government introduced Bill C-11, An Act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, for consideration in the House of Commons. Should Bill C-11 come into force, all private organizations that collect, use, and disclose personal information will become subject to new obligations and restrictions, including, without limitation, in connection with obtaining consent, access and control over personal information, deletion of personal information, data portability, de-identification of personal information, and transparency requirements. The penalties and enforcement measures available to Canadian regulators for non-compliance that are contemplated under Bill C-11 and Bill-64 are more significant than those that are available under current privacy and data protection legislation in Canada. In addition, with respect to consumer health information, there are a number of federal, state and provincial laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. For example, the privacy rules under PIPEDA and other applicable privacy laws protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure of health information to the minimum level reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose and may apply to our operations globally. In Canada, we may also be required to retain certain customer personal information for prescribed periods of time pursuant to the Cannabis Act. Overall, failure to maintain adequate compliance or safeguards regarding stakeholder privacy could materially adversely impact TerrAscend’s business and result in fines, litigation or certain government mandated actions, and could be detrimental to TerrAscend’s ability to operate its business. TerrAscend’s products may be subject to product recalls or returns, which may result in expense, legal proceedings, regulatory action, loss of sales and reputation, and management attention. TerrAscendʼs products may be subject to recall or return for a variety of reasons, including product defects such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of TerrAscendʼs products are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, TerrAscend could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection therewith. TerrAscend may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Although TerrAscend has detailed procedures in place for testing its products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of the products produced by TerrAscend were subject to recall, the image of that product and TerrAscend could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for TerrAscendʼs products and could have a material adverse 32 effect on the results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of TerrAscendʼs operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses. TerrAscend faces an inherent risk of product liability claims and other consumer protection claims as a manufacturer, processor and producer of products that are meant to be ingested by people, and dealing with such claims could cause TerrAscend to incur substantial expenses and have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business. As a manufacturer of products designed to be ingested by humans, TerrAscend faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if its products are alleged to have caused loss or injury. In addition, the manufacturing and sale of cannabis and other products involve the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination, or unauthorized sale of counterfeit products. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of cannabis products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur. TerrAscend may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that the products produced by TerrAscend caused injury or illness, include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against TerrAscend could result in increased costs, could adversely affect TerrAscendʼs reputation with its clients and consumers generally, and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs products may be considered misbranded or adulterated, or otherwise unlawful under federal and state food and drug laws and could subject TerrAscend to local, federal, or state enforcement or private litigation. Some states permit advertising, labeling laws, false and deceptive trade practices, and other consumer-protection laws to be enforced by state attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by TerrAscend. Private litigation may also seek relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by TerrAscend in any of the markets in which it operates. Any actions against TerrAscend by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may be subject to constraints on and differences in marketing its products under varying regulatory restrictions. The development of TerrAscendʼs business and results of operations may be hindered by applicable regulatory restrictions on sales and marketing activities. For example, the regulatory environment in Canada limits TerrAscendʼs ability to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries. If TerrAscend is unable to effectively market its products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for TerrAscendʼs products, TerrAscendʼs sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. TerrAscend may be subject to heightened scrutiny by Canadian regulatory authorities, which could negatively affect its business. TerrAscendʼs future investments, joint ventures and operations in the United States may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, TerrAscend may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not in turn lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on TerrAscendʼs ability to invest in the United States or any other jurisdiction, in addition to those described herein. Although a memorandum of understanding signed by the Canadian Depository for Securities (“CDS”) and the Canadian recognized exchanges (Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., the CSE, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange) dated February 8, 2018, confirms that CDS relies on the exchanges to review the conduct of listed issuers, and therefore there is currently no CDS ban on the clearing of securities of issuers with cannabis-related activities in the United States, there can be no guarantee that this approach to regulation will continue in the future. If such a ban were to be implemented, it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of Common Shares to make and settle trades. In particular, Common Shares would become highly illiquid as and until an alternative was implemented, investors would have no ability to affect a trade of Common Shares through the facilities of a stock exchange. TerrAscend’s investors and directors, officers and employees who are not U.S. citizens may be denied entry into the United States, which may negatively affect TerrAscend’s business. Because cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, those employed at or investing in legal and licensed Canadian cannabis companies could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with U.S. cannabis businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of the US Customs and Border Protection officers on duty, and these 33 officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a foreign national. The Government of Canada has started warning travelers on its website that previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the legal cannabis industry in Canada or in the United States could also be reason enough for U.S. border guards to deny entry . Because TerrAscend’s contracts involve cannabis and related activities, which are not legal under U.S. federal law, TerrAscend may face difficulties in enforcing its contracts. It is a fundamental principle of law that a contract will not be enforced if it involves a violation of law or public policy. Because cannabis remains illegal at a federal level, judges may refuse to enforce contracts in connection with activities that violate U.S. federal law, even if there is no violation of state law. There remains doubt and uncertainty that TerrAscend will be able to legally enforce contracts it enters into if necessary. TerrAscend cannot be assured that it will have a remedy for breach of contract, the lack of which may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, revenues, operating results, financial condition or prospects. TerrAscend may encounter increasingly strict environmental health and safety regulations in connection with its operations, which may harm TerrAscend’s business. TerrAscendʼs operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions and discharges to water, air and land, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, and employee health and safety. Changes in environmental, employee health and safety or other laws, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to TerrAscendʼs operations or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. Transition to becoming a U.S. reporting company poses added risks as a result of required compliance changes. TerrAscend has determined that it no longer meets the definition of a foreign private issuer (“FPI”) as at the applicable reference date. As a public issuer, TerrAscend is currently subject to the reporting requirements and rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, in addition to Canadian securities laws, where applicable, and rules of any stock exchange on which TerrAscend’s securities may be listed from time to time. Additional or new regulatory requirements may be adopted in the future. The loss of FPI status and subsequent transition to becoming a US filer may have adverse consequences on TerrAscend’s ability to issue its securities to acquire companies and its ability to raise capital in private placements or prospectus offerings. In addition, the requirements of existing and potential future rules and regulations will increase TerrAscend’s legal, audit, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on the Company’s personnel, systems and resources. TerrAscend's transition of financial reporting from IFRS to U.S. GAAP could adversely affect TerrAscend’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Risks Related to TerrAscend’s Business, Operations and Industry TerrAscend’s indebtedness may adversely affect TerrAscend’s business, results of operations and financial condition. TerrAscend’s failure to comply with applicable covenants could trigger events that may materially adversely affect TerrAscend’s business, results of operations and financial condition. TerrAscend’s indebtedness may adversely affect TerrAscend’s business, results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2022, TerrAscend had approximately $205 million of total debt principal amounts outstanding. See the section titled ""Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources"" of this Annual Report for more information regarding TerrAscend's indebtedness. As a result of its indebtedness, a portion of TerrAscend's cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on its outstanding loans. TerrAscend's indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could 34 TerrAscend expects to use cash flow from operations and outside financings to meet its current and future financial obligations, including funding its operations, debt service and capital expenditures. TerrAscend’s ability to make these payments depends on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which TerrAscend cannot control. TerrAscend’s business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in TerrAscend being unable to repay indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If TerrAscend does not generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be forced to reduce or delay its business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity. TerrAscend cannot make any assurances that it will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to it, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future indebtedness may limit TerrAscend’s ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Furthermore, the instruments governing TerrAscend’s indebtedness include obligations and covenants that limit TerrAscend’s discretion with respect to certain business matters and require TerrAscend to satisfy certain financial requirements. TerrAscend can make no assurances that it will be able to comply with such obligations and covenants and any failure to comply could result in a default, which, if not amended, cured or waived, could permit acceleration of the relevant indebtedness and the exercise of other remedies available to the lenders. In such event, there can be no assurance that TerrAscend would be able to obtain any amendment, cure, waiver or other relief on terms acceptable to TerrAscend. If TerrAscend is unable to obtain relief from an event of the relevant indebtedness may be accelerated and the related collateral may be foreclosed upon, in addition such circumstances may result in the cross-default or cross-acceleration of other debt, any of which would materially adversely affect TerrAscend's business, results of operations, and financial condition. TerrAscend may require substantial additional financing to operate its business and it may face difficulties acquiring additional financing on terms acceptable to TerrAscend, or at all. The building and operation of TerrAscendʼs business, including its facilities, are capital intensive. In order to execute the anticipated growth strategy, TerrAscend may require additional equity and/or debt financing to support on-going operations, to undertake capital expenditures or to undertake acquisitions or other business combination transactions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to TerrAscend when needed or on terms which are acceptable. TerrAscendʼs inability to raise financing to support on-going operations or to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit TerrAscendʼs growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. TerrAscend may require additional financing to fund its operations to the point where it is generating positive cash flows. Any debt financing secured in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for TerrAscend to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Raising additional funds by issuing equity securities will cause dilution to existing stockholders. Raising additional funds through debt financings may involve restrictive covenants and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. We may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. TerrAscend expects that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue its planned operations. TerrAscend expects to finance its cash needs through revenue from ongoing operations and a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and other strategies. TerrAscend cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to TerrAscend, if at all. If TerrAscend raises additional equity financing, its shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of a common shareholder, and the per-share value of TerrAscend’s common shares could decline. If TerrAscend engages in debt financing, it may be required to accept terms that restrict or limit TerrAscend’s ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional indebtedness, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and other restrictive covenants that could adversely impact TerrAscend’s ability to conduct its business. In addition, weakness and volatility in the capital markets and the economy in general could limit our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. 35 An adverse change in market conditions, including a sustained decline in TerrAscend’s share price, negative changes to TerrAscend’s position in the market, or lack of growth in demand for its products and services could be considered to be an impairment triggering event. Such changes could impact valuation assumptions relating to the recoverability of assets and have resulted in, and may in the future result in, impairment charges to TerrAscend’s goodwill or long-lived asset balances, which would negatively impact TerrAscend’s operating results and harm its business. There are inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill, intangible, and other long-lived assets. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a deterioration in the U.S., Canadian and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows and could potentially result in an impairment charge. From time to time, TerrAscend may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of TerrAscend’s goodwill or intangible and other long-lived assets is determined, which might have a materially adverse impact on TerrAscend’s business operations and its financial position or results of operations. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2022, it was determined that it was more likely than not that the Michigan reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying value, and a one-step goodwill quantitative impairment test was performed. As a result of the quantitative test, TerrAscend recorded impairment of goodwill of $170,357 at its Michigan reporting unit. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend performed an impairment analysis over its indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition as the changes in the market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were determined to be indicators of impairment. TerrAscend determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of its definite lived retail and cultivation and processing licenses was greater than its fair value, and therefore, recorded impairment of $79,462 and $42,065 for the retail license and the cultivation and processing licenses, respectively. TerrAscend faces intense competition as a relatively new entrant in the cannabis industry, and its business could be adversely affected by other businesses in a better competitive position. The introduction of an adult-use model for cannabis production and distribution may impact the growth in the existing medical cannabis market. The impact of this potential development may be negative for TerrAscend and could result in increased levels of competition in its existing medical market and/or the entry of new competitors in the overall cannabis market in which TerrAscend operates. There is potential that TerrAscend will face intense competition from other companies, particularly larger multi-state operators, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than TerrAscend. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend and result in lower than anticipated growth in both the existing medical cannabis market and the adult-use market. If the number of users of medical cannabis in North America increases, the demand for products will increase and TerrAscend expects that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. To remain competitive, TerrAscend will require a continued high level of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. TerrAscend may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. Consolidation in the cannabis industry and other changes to the competitive environment can impact TerrAscend's margins and profitability. The markets for cannabis in the US and Canada are becoming increasingly competitive and are evolving rapidly. TerrAscend may face intense and increasing competition from existing operators and new entrants in each of the markets that TerrAscend operates in. Some of these competitors may have longer operating histories or offer competitive products. There is also the potential that the cannabis industry will undergo further consolidation that may pose a risk to TerrAscend’s ability to compete. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to maintain our operations or develop them as currently intended. Increased competition by larger, better-financed competitors with geographic advantages could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to achieve our business objectives, such failure could materially adversely affect our business. As the emerging cannabis industry continues to rapidly evolve, we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our success will depend on our ability to respond to, among other things, changes in consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, and general competitive pressures. Should TerrAscend be unable to adequately respond to 36 such changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance. In each market we operate in, the number of licenses granted, and the number of license holders ultimately authorized by the regulator, or previously authorized licenses becoming more commercially active, could have an impact on our business. If the number of users of medical and/or recreational cannabis increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. To remain competitive, we will require a continued high level of investment in R&D, sales and customer support. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain R&D, sales and customer support efforts on a competitive basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. TerrAscend may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which would reduce earnings. TerrAscend periodically calculates the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, market and economic conditions, impact on operations due to changing consumer preferences, successful execution of product launches and overall competitive activity within the market. Certain events can also trigger an immediate review of goodwill and intangible assets. If the carrying value of our reporting unit and other intangible assets exceed their fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the goodwill and other intangible assets are considered impaired, which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We may be required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in future periods for TerrAscend, to the extent TerrAscend experiences declines in the price of its common shares. The cannabis industry and market are relatively new, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as expected. TerrAscend is operating its business in a relatively new industry and market. Competitive conditions, consumer preferences, patient requirements and spending patterns in this new industry and market are relatively unknown and may have unique circumstances that differ from existing industries and markets. Accordingly, there are no assurances that this industry and market will continue to exist or grow as currently estimated or anticipated, or function and evolve in a manner consistent with management’s expectations and assumptions. Any event or circumstance that affects the medical cannabis industry and market could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscendʼs success in North America is dependent on the market building out direct to consumer channels including but not limited to retail outlets. There are many factors which could impact TerrAscendʼs ability to gain market share and distribute its products, including but not limited to the continued growth and expansion of retail outlets in the North American market which may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, operating results and financial condition. TerrAscendʼs ability to continue to grow, process, store and sell medical cannabis and participate in the adult-use cannabis markets is dependent on the maintenance and validity of TerrAscendʼs licenses from regulatory authorities. The cannabis industry and markets are relatively new in North America and in other jurisdictions, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as anticipated or TerrAscend may ultimately be unable to succeed in this industry and market. TerrAscend's profitability may be impacted by declining wholesale or retail cannabis prices in certain markets and shifting market conditions. TerrAscend’s gross profits may decline as a result of reduction in wholesale or retail cannabis prices. TerrAscend’s profitability is sensitive to fluctuations in wholesale and retail prices caused by crop seasonality, disruptions to supply chains, increased competition, government taxes or levies, and other market conditions, all of which are factors beyond TerrAscend’s control. There is currently not an established market price for cannabis and the price of may change rapidly. Any price decline may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. If a significant number of new licenses are granted by a regulator in a market in which TerrAscend operates, TerrAscend may experience increased competition for market share and may experience downward price pressure on our products as new entrants increase production. We may also face competition from illegal cannabis dispensaries that are selling cannabis to individuals despite not having a valid license. The continued declining wholesale and retail price will impact the Company’s overall business. 37 TerrAscend has historically had negative cash flow from operating activities, and continued losses could have a material negative effect on TerrAscend's business and prospects and impact TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern. TerrAscend started sales in April 2018 and historically has had negative cash flow from operating activities. As of December 31, 2022, TerrAscend has an accumulated deficit of approximately $618 million. TerrAscend incurred losses in fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2022. TerrAscend may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and may continue to incur significant losses in the future. TerrAscend's cash flow and net losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 are indicators that raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. In addition, debt service requirements will have an adverse impact on liquidity. Because the cannabis industry and market are relatively new and rapidly evolving, it is difficult for TerrAscend to predict its future operating results. As a result, it may incur future losses that may be larger than anticipated. In addition, TerrAscend expects to continue to increase operating expenses as it implements initiatives to continue to grow its business. TerrAscend's ability to execute on its growth strategy requires significant additional financing. TerrAscend will need to raise additional funds in order to operate its business and meet obligations as they become due. However, financing may not be available to TerrAscend in the necessary time frame, in amounts that TerrAscend requires, on terms that are acceptable to TerrAscend, or at all. If TerrAscend is unable to raise the necessary funds when needed, it may materially and adversely impact TerrAscend's ability to execute on its operating plans. If TerrAscend becomes unable to continue as a going concern, TerrAscend may have to dispose of assets and might realize significantly less than the values at which are carried on its consolidated financial statements. These actions may cause TerrAscend's stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in TerrAscend's common stock. If TerrAscendʼs sales do not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, TerrAscend will not be profitable. Furthermore, if TerrAscend's future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, or if it has future negative cash flow or losses resulting from its investment in product development or marketing, its financial condition and share price could be materially adversely affected. TerrAscend may be affected by currency fluctuations. TerrAscend may face exposure to currency fluctuations because of its present operations in the U.S. Recent events in the global financial markets have been coupled with increased volatility in the currency markets. All or substantially all of TerrAscend’s revenue is earned in U.S. dollars, but its shares, employee options and some of its warrants issued to holders of TerrAscend’s notes are denominated in Canadian dollars which can provide variability for results of operations. TerrAscend does not have currency hedging arrangements in place and there is no expectation that it will put any currency hedging arrangements in place in the future. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business, financial position or results of operations. Demand for TerrAscend’s products is difficult to forecast due to limited and unreliable market data. As a result of recent and ongoing regulatory and policy changes in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry, the market data available is limited and unreliable. Federal and state laws prevent widespread participation and hinder market research. Therefore, TerrAscend must rely largely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts are not generally obtainable from other sources at this early stage of the industry. Market research and projections by TerrAscend of estimated total retail sales, demographics, demand, and similar consumer research are based on assumptions from limited and unreliable market data, and generally represent the personal opinions of TerrAscendʼs management team as of the date of this Form 10-K. A failure in the demand for its products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of TerrAscend. TerrAscend’s inability to attract and retain key personnel could materially adversely affect its business. The success of TerrAscend is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith of its senior management, which are key personnel. Moreover, TerrAscendʼs future success depends on its continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and TerrAscend may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. TerrAscend does not maintain ""key man"" insurance policies on the lives of its key personnel, or the lives of any of its other employees. In order to induce valuable employees to continue their employment with the company, TerrAscend has provided stock options and restricted stock units that vest over time. The value to employees of such equity grants that vest over time is significantly affected by movements in TerrAscend's share price that are beyond TerrAscend's control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. In addition, if TerrAscend's share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, TerrAscend's ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel could be weakened, which could harm its business. The loss of the services of key personnel, or an inability to attract other suitably qualified persons when needed, could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs ability to execute on its business plan and strategy, and TerrAscend may be unable to find adequate replacements 38 on a timely basis, or at all. While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of such key personnel these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees. There is no assurance that any of TerrAscendʼs existing personnel who presently or may in the future require a security clearance will be able to obtain or renew such clearances or that new personnel who require a security clearance will be able to obtain one. A failure by such key personnel to maintain or renew their security clearance would result in a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any key personnel leave TerrAscend, and TerrAscend is unable to find a suitable replacement that has a security clearance in a timely manner, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and other key employees in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel in its industry. Many of the other cannabis companies that it competes against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than TerrAscend does. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what TerrAscend has to offer. If TerrAscend is unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which it can develop and market its products will be limited. TerrAscend may face unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, efficacy and quality of its cannabis products. TerrAscend believes the cannabis industry is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the cannabis distributed to such consumers. Consumer perception of TerrAscendʼs products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of medical cannabis products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the medical cannabis market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for TerrAscendʼs products and the business, results of operations, financial condition of TerrAscend. In particular, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of medical cannabis in general, or TerrAscendʼs products specifically, or associating the consumption of medical cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could have such a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers’ failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed. For instance, the vape crisis that began in the summer of 2019 was ultimately linked to cutting agents almost exclusively found in the illicit market. Regardless, several states moved to ban the sale of vape products in legal markets, severely impacting entire revenue streams. Although TerrAscend believes that it takes care in protecting its image and reputation, TerrAscend does not ultimately have direct control over how it is perceived by others. Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and an impediment to TerrAscendʼs overall ability to advance its business, thereby having a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. TerrAscend faces reputational risks, which may negatively impact its business. Damage to TerrAscendʼs reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, and could include any negative publicity, whether true or not. The increased usage of social media and other web-based tools used to generate, publish, and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share opinions and views in regards to TerrAscend and its activities, whether true or not. Although TerrAscend believes that it operates in a manner that is respectful to all shareholders and that it takes care in protecting its image and reputation, TerrAscend does not ultimately have direct control over how it is perceived by others. Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations, and an impediment to TerrAscendʼs overall ability to advance its projects, thereby having a material adverse impact on financial performance, financial condition, cash flows, and growth prospects. Further, the parties with which TerrAscend does business may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result of TerrAscendʼs cannabis business activities. Failure to establish or maintain business relationships could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. TerrAscend is dependent on suppliers and key inputs for the cultivation, extraction and production of cannabis products. 39 The ability of TerrAscend to compete and grow will be dependent on it having access, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, to equipment, parts and components. No assurances can be given that TerrAscend will be successful in maintaining its required supply of equipment, parts and components. Global supply challenges have added further uncertainties around availability and price of equipment, parts and components. It is also possible that the final costs of the major equipment contemplated by TerrAscendʼs capital expenditure plans may be significantly greater than anticipated by TerrAscendʼs management and may be greater than funds available to TerrAscend, in which circumstance TerrAscend may curtail, or extend the timeframes for completing, its capital expenditure plans. This could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. The cannabis business is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other local utilities. Any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs could materially impact the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. In addition, any restrictions on the ability to secure required supplies or utility services or to do so on commercially acceptable terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business, financial condition and operating results. Some of these inputs may only be available from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. If a sole source supplier was to go out of business, TerrAscend might be unable to find a replacement for such source in a timely manner or at all. If a sole source supplier were to be acquired by a competitor, that competitor may elect not to sell to TerrAscend in the future. Any inability to secure required supplies and services or to do so on appropriate terms and/or agreeable terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs business is subject to the risks inherent in agricultural operations. TerrAscendʼs business involves the cultivation of the cannabis plant. The cultivation of this plant is subject to agricultural risks related to insects, plant diseases, unstable growing conditions, water and electricity availability and cost, and force majeure events. Although TerrAscend cultivates its cannabis plants in indoor or greenhouse, climate controlled rooms staffed by trained personnel, there can be no assurance that agricultural risks will not have a material adverse effect on the cultivation of its cannabis. TerrAscend may in the future cultivate cannabis plants outdoors, which would also subject it to related agricultural risks. TerrAscend may be adversely impacted by rising or volatile energy costs. TerrAscendʼs cannabis growing and manufacturing operations consume considerable energy, which make TerrAscend vulnerable to rising energy costs. Accordingly, rising or volatile energy costs have adversely impacted the business of TerrAscend and its profitability. TerrAscendʼs intellectual property may be difficult to protect, and failure to do so may negatively impact its business. The ownership and protection of trademarks, patents, trade secrets and intellectual property rights are significant aspects of TerrAscendʼs future success. TerrAscend has no patented technology or trademarked business methods at this time, nor has it registered any patents. TerrAscend has filed trademark applications in the United States and Canada. TerrAscend will continue to seek trademark protection in the United States and Canada. TerrAscend’s ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada, including the United States, where registered federal trademark protection is currently unavailable for trademarks covering marijuana-related products and services that are illegal under the CSA. Accordingly, TerrAscend’s ability to obtain intellectual property rights or enforce intellectual property rights against third party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain countries. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released a policy on May 2, 2019 that clarifies that applications for trademarks for products that meet the definition of hemp could be accepted for registration, with certain exceptions. Even if TerrAscend moves to protect its technology with trademarks, patents, copyrights or by other means, TerrAscend is not assured that competitors will not develop similar technology, business methods or that TerrAscend will be able to exercise its legal rights. Other countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same standards as does the United States or Canada. Actions taken to protect or preserve intellectual property rights may require significant financial and other resources which may have a significant impact on TerrAscendʼs ability to successfully grow the business. In addition, other parties may claim that TerrAscendʼs products infringe on their proprietary and perhaps patent protected rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in TerrAscendʼs expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, legal fees, result in injunctions, temporary restraining orders and/or require the payment of damages. 40 TerrAscend and investors may have difficulty enforcing their legal rights. In the event of a dispute arising from TerrAscendʼs U.S. operations, TerrAscend may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdictions of courts in Canada. Similarly, to the extent that TerrAscendʼs assets are located outside of Canada, investors may have difficulty collecting from TerrAscend any judgments obtained in the Canadian courts and predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities provisions. TerrAscend may also be hindered or prevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a governmental entity or instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. TerrAscend (and the third parties upon which it relies) faces physical security risks, as well as risks related to its information technology systems, potential cyber-attacks, and security breaches. In the ordinary course of its business, TerrAscend collects, receives, stores, processes, generates, uses, transfers, discloses, makes accessible, protects, secures, disposes of, transmits, and shares (collectively, processes) personal data about its patients, adult-use customers and guests and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party data, business plans, transactions, and financial information (collectively, sensitive data). TerrAscend is responsible for protecting sensitive data from security breaches. If there was a breach in security systems and TerrAscend became victim to a robbery or theft or if there was a failure of information technology systems or a component of information technology systems, or if TerrAscend's sensitive data were compromised, it could, depending on the nature of any such breach, failure or compromise, adversely impact TerrAscendʼs reputation, business continuity and results of operations. Any such security breach, failure or compromise could expose TerrAscend to additional liability and to potentially costly litigation, government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, indemnification obligations, negative publicity, increase expenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of these breaches and may deter potential customers from choosing TerrAscendʼs products. Given the nature of TerrAscendʼs products and its lack of legal availability outside of channels approved by the government of the US, as well as the concentration of inventory in its facilities, there remains a risk of shrinkage as well as theft. A security breach may occur through procedural or process failure, information technology malfunction, or deliberate unauthorized intrusions. Cyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of TerrAscend’s sensitive data and information technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which it relies. Such threats are prevalent and continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, TerrAscend and the third parties upon which it relies may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyber-attacks, that could materially disrupt its systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute its services. TerrAscend and the third parties upon which it relies are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, power loss, vandalism, theft, and other similar threats. In particular, severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in TerrAscend’s operations, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but TerrAscend may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. Remote work has become more common and has increased risks to TerrAscend’s information technology systems and data, as more of its employees utilize network connections, computers, and devices outside its premises or network, including working at home, while in transit and in public locations. Additionally, future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose TerrAscend to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as its systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, TerrAscend may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into TerrAscend’s information technology environment and security program 41 In addition, TerrAscend's reliance on third-party service providers could introduce new cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other threats to its business operations. TerrAscend has entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology (or “IT”) services in connection with its operations. TerrAscend’s ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If its third-party service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, TerrAscend could experience adverse consequences. While TerrAscend may be entitled to damages if its third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to TerrAscend, any award may be insufficient to cover TerrAscend’s damages, or TerrAscend may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and TerrAscend cannot guarantee that third parties’ infrastructure in its supply chain or its third-party partners’ supply chains have not been compromised. TerrAscendʼs operations depend, in part, on how well it and its suppliers protect networks, equipment, IT systems and software against damage from of the aforementioned or similar threats. TerrAscendʼs operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other events could TerrAscend’s ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If its third-party service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, TerrAscend could experience adverse consequences. While TerrAscend may be entitled to damages if its third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to TerrAscend, any award may be insufficient to cover TerrAscend’s damages, or TerrAscend may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and TerrAscend cannot guarantee that third parties’ infrastructure in its supply chain or its third-party partners’ supply chains have not been compromised. TerrAscend may expend significant resources or modify its business activities to try to protect against security breaches. Additionally, certain data privacy and security obligations may require TerrAscend to implement and maintain specific security measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect its information technology systems and sensitive data. While TerrAscend has implemented security measures designed to protect against security breaches, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. TerrAscend takes steps to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, but it may not be able to detect and remediate all vulnerabilities because the threats and techniques used to exploit the vulnerability change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature. Therefore, such vulnerabilities could be exploited but may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. These vulnerabilities pose material risks to TerrAscend’s business. Further, TerrAscend may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require TerrAscend to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. TerrAscend’s contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in its contracts are sufficient to protect it from liabilities, damages, or claims related to its data privacy and security obligations. TerrAscend cannot be sure that its insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect it from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of its privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. In addition to experiencing a security breach, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive data about it from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about TerrAscend and could be used to undermine its competitive advantage or market position. TerrAscend is or may become subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Its actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; and other adverse business consequences. TerrAscend’s data processing activities may subject it to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements, and other obligations relating to data privacy and security. In the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade 42 Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, there are a number of federal, state, and local laws protecting the confidentiality of certain health-related information of TerrAscend’s patients and customers, including their health-related records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that information. As another example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) (collectively, “CCPA”) applies to personal data of consumers, business representatives, and employees who are California residents, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of such individuals to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for administrative fines of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA expanded the CCPA’s requirements, including by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal data and establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. Other states, such as Virginia and Colorado, have also passed comprehensive privacy laws, and similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. These developments may further complicate compliance efforts, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for TerrAscend and the third parties upon whom it relies. Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards may govern data privacy and security. For example, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) imposes strict requirements for processing personal data. In addition to data privacy and security laws, TerrAscend is bound by other contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and its efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. TerrAscend publishes privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statement. If found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of its practices, TerrAscend may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences. Obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and creating regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires TerrAscend to devote significant resources and may necessitate changes to its services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on its behalf. TerrAscend may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in its efforts to comply with its data privacy and security obligations. Moreover, despite its efforts, TerrAscend’s personnel or third parties on whom it relies may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact its business operations. If TerrAscend or the third parties on which it relies fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, it could face significant consequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-action claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans on processing personal data; and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers; inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize its products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or substantial changes to its business model or operations. TerrAscend faces exposure to fraudulent or illegal activity by employees, contractors and consultants, which may subject TerrAscend to investigations or other actions. TerrAscend is exposed to the risk that its employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to TerrAscend that violates: (i) government regulations; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal, state and provincial healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It may not always be possible for TerrAscend to identify and deter misconduct by its employees and other third parties, and the precautions taken by TerrAscend to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting TerrAscend from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against TerrAscend, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on TerrAscendʼs business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of TerrAscendʼs operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 43 Directors and officers of TerrAscend have faced, and may in the future face, conflicts of interests regarding the business strategy of TerrAscend. Certain of the directors and officers of TerrAscend are also directors and officers of other companies or are engaged and will continue to be engaged in activities that may put them in conflict with the business strategy of TerrAscend. Consequently, there exists the possibility for such directors and officers to be in a position of conflict. In particular, TerrAscend may also become involved in other transactions which conflict with the interests of its directors and officers, who may from time to time deal with persons, firms, institutions or companies with which TerrAscend may be dealing, or which may be seeking investments similar to those desired by it. All decisions to be made by directors and officers of TerrAscend are required to be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of TerrAscend. In addition, the directors and officers are required to declare their interests in, and such directors are required to refrain from voting on, any matter in which they may have a material conflict of interest. TerrAscend’s internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and the TerrAscend’s independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business. TerrAscend is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the ""Sarbanes-Oxley Act""). Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, TerrAscend is required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of its internal control over financial reporting to allow Company management to report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, if at such time, TerrAscend no longer qualifies as a ""emerging growth company,"" its independent registered public accounting firm will be required to issue an annual report that attests the effectiveness of TerrAscend's internal control over financial reporting. TerrAscend incurs expenses and, to a lesser extent, diversion of Company management’s time in its efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for TerrAscend to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause TerrAscend to fail to meet its reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by TerrAscend conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by TerrAscend’s independent registered public accounting firm when required, may reveal deficiencies in TerrAscend’s internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retrospective changes to TerrAscend’s consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Moreover, TerrAscend's internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objective will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If TerrAscend is unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in TerrAscend's reported financial information, the trading price of TerrAscend's Common Shares could decline and TerrAscend could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. TerrAscend’s business could be adversely affected by economic downturns, inflation, increases in interest rates, natural disasters, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, political crises, geopolitical events, such as the crisis in Ukraine, or other macroeconomic conditions, which have in the past and may in the future negatively impact TerrAscend’s business and financial performance. The global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including, among other things, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, supply chain shortages, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread unemployment, economic slowdown and extreme volatility in the capital markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve recently raised interest rates multiple times in response to concerns about inflation and it may raise them again. Higher interest rates, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets may increase economic uncertainty and affect consumer spending. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, such as the crisis in Ukraine, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Increased inflation rates can adversely affect TerrAscend by increasing TerrAscend’s costs, including labor and employee benefit costs. 44 The development of TerrAscend’s products is complex and requires significant investment. Failure to develop new technologies and products could adversely affect TerrAscend’s business. The introduction of new products embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes, and the emergence of new industry standards may render TerrAscendʼs products obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The process of developing TerrAscendʼs products is complex and requires significant continuing costs, development efforts and third-party commitments. TerrAscendʼs failure to develop new technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of TerrAscend. TerrAscend may be unable to anticipate changes in its potential customer requirements that could make TerrAscendʼs existing technology obsolete. The development of TerrAscendʼs proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. TerrAscend may not be successful in using its new technologies or exploiting its niche markets effectively or adapting its businesses to evolving customer or medical requirements or preferences or emerging industry standards. TerrAscend needs to attract and retain customers and patients in order to succeed, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business. TerrAscendʼs success depends on its ability to attract and retain customers and patients. There are many factors which could impact TerrAscendʼs ability to attract and retain customers and patients, including but not limited to TerrAscendʼs ability to continually produce desirable and effective products and, the successful implementation of a customer and patient-acquisition plan. TerrAscendʼs failure to acquire and retain customers and patients would have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, operating results and financial condition. TerrAscend has a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects and predict future operating results. TerrAscend has a limited operating history and, accordingly, potential investors will have a limited basis on which to evaluate its ability to achieve its business objectives. The future success of TerrAscend is dependent on management’s ability to implement its strategy, there is no certainty that anticipated outcomes and sustainable revenue streams will be achieved and there is no certainty that TerrAscend will successfully produce commercial medical cannabis, establish a market for and sell its product, maintain its licenses or obtain other necessary licenses and/or approvals. TerrAscend faces risks frequently encountered by early-stage companies. In particular, its future growth and prospects will depend on its ability to expand its operation and gain additional revenue streams while at the same time maintaining effective cost controls. Any failure to expand is likely to have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results. As such, there is no assurance that TerrAscend will be successful in achieving a return on TerrAscend shareholders’ investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the early stage of operations. TerrAscend may be subject to growth-related risks, which could negatively affect its business. TerrAscend may be subject to growth-related risks including capacity constraints and pressure on its internal systems and controls. The ability of TerrAscend to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand, train and manage its employee base. The inability of TerrAscend to deal with this growth may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Risks Related to TerrAscend’s Investment and Acquisition Business Strategies The success of TerrAscendʼs business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses and to retain key employees of acquired businesses. If TerrAscend is unsuccessful in doing so, it may negatively affect TerrAscendʼs business. TerrAscend may not be able to successfully integrate and combine the operations, personnel and technology infrastructure of any such acquired company with its existing operations. If integration is not managed successfully by TerrAscendʼs management, TerrAscend may experience interruptions to its business activities, deterioration in its employee and customer relationships, increased costs of integration and harm to its reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may experience difficulties in combining corporate cultures, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees. The integration of any such acquired companies may also impose substantial demands on management. There is no assurance that these acquisitions will be successfully integrated in a timely manner. 45 There can be no assurance that TerrAscend’s current and future strategic alliances will have a beneficial impact on TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend currently has, and may in the future, enter into strategic alliances with third parties that it believes will complement or augment its existing business. TerrAscendʼs ability to complete strategic alliances is dependent upon, and may be limited by, the availability of suitable candidates and capital. In addition, strategic alliances could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs, may not enhance TerrAscendʼs business, and may involve risks that could adversely affect TerrAscend, including significant amounts of management time that may be diverted from operations in order to pursue and complete such transactions or maintain such strategic alliances. Future strategic alliances could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities, and there can be no assurance that future strategic alliances will achieve, or that TerrAscendʼs existing strategic alliances will continue to achieve, the expected benefits to TerrAscendʼs business or that TerrAscend will be able to consummate future strategic alliances on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend’s use of joint ventures may expose TerrAscend to risks associated with jointly owned investments. TerrAscend currently operates parts of its business through joint ventures with other companies, and it may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Joint venture investments and partnerships may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by TerrAscend, including: (i) TerrAscend may not control the joint ventures; (ii) TerrAscend’s joint venture partners may not agree to distributions that it believe are appropriate; (iii) where TerrAscend does not have substantial decision-making authority, it may experience impasses or disputes with TerrAscend’s joint venture partners on certain decisions, which could require it to expend additional resources to resolve such impasses or disputes, including litigation or arbitration; (iv) TerrAscend’s joint venture partners may become insolvent or bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfil their obligations as a joint venture partner; (v) the arrangements governing TerrAscend’s joint ventures may contain certain conditions or milestone events that may never be satisfied or achieved; (vi) TerrAscend’s joint venture partners may have business or economic interests that are inconsistent with TerrAscend’s and may take actions contrary to TerrAscend’s interests; (vii) TerrAscend may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by TerrAscend’s joint venture partners with respect to TerrAscend’s joint venture investments; and (viii) it may be difficult for TerrAscend to exit a joint venture if an impasse arises or if TerrAscend desires to sell its interest for any reason. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, TerrAscend may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of its joint venture partners. TerrAscend may not realize the benefits of its growth strategy, which could have an adverse effect on TerrAscend's business. In March 2022, TerrAscend acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Gage, a cultivator and processor in Michigan (such transaction, the “Gage Acquisition”). TerrAscend believes that the completion of the Gage Acquisition will allow it to accelerate its strategic efforts to capitalize on significant growth opportunities by gaining exposure to the Michigan market. As part of its growth strategy, TerrAscend will continue in its existing efforts and initiate new efforts to expand its footprint, and brand and marketing capabilities. Such expansion is dependent on availability of capital funding, achieving satisfactory returns on the acquisition of Gage, continuing to enter into successful business arrangements and certain assumptions about being able to achieve Gage’s projected growth strategy. The failure to successfully implement either its own strategic initiatives, or those with respect to Gage, could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business and results of operations. Risks Related to TerrAscend’s Common Shares TerrAscend’s voting control is concentrated. Mr. Jason Wild, TerrAscendʼs Executive Chairman and Chairman of TerrAscend’s Board, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over shares representing approximately 28.52% of the voting capital stock of TerrAscend as of March 14, 2023. As a result, he exerts significant control over matters that may be put forth for the consideration of all TerrAscend shareholders, including for example, the approval of a potential business combination or consolidation, a liquidation or sale of all or substantially all of TerrAscendʼs assets, electing members to TerrAscend’s Board, and adopting amendments to TerrAscendʼs constating documents, including its articles of incorporation, as amended (the “Articles”) and by-laws. TerrAscend’s Preferred Shares have a liquidation preference over the Common Shares, which could limit TerrAscend’s ability to make distributions to the holders of Common Shares. 46 In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of TerrAscend, whether voluntary or involuntary, or upon any other return of capital or distribution of the assets of TerrAscend among its shareholders, in each case for the purposes of winding up its affairs, TerrAscend’s preferred shares (the “Preferred Shares”) are entitled to receive any distribution available to be paid out of the assets of TerrAscend before the Proportionate Voting Shares, Common Shares and exchangeable shares of TerrAscend (the “Exchangeable Shares”). Accordingly, should TerrAscend be liquidated, dissolved or wound-up, TerrAscend may be unable to make any distribution to the holders of the Common Shares. An investor may face liquidity risks with an investment in the Common Shares. TerrAscendʼs Common Shares are listed on the CSE and also trade over the counter in the United States on the OTCQX® Best Market, however, there can be no assurance that an active and/or liquid market for Common Shares will develop or be maintained and an investor may find it difficult to resell any securities of TerrAscend. For example, given the heightened risk profile associated with cannabis in the United States, capital markets participants may be unwilling to assist with the settlement of trades for U.S. resident securityholders of companies with operations in the U.S. cannabis industry, which may prohibit or significantly impair the ability of securityholders in the United States to trade TerrAscend's securities. In the event residents of the United States are unable to settle trades of TerrAscend's securities, this may affect the pricing of such securities in the secondary market, the transparency and availability of trading prices and the liquidity of these securities. The price of TerrAscend’s Common Shares may be volatile, and may be adversely affected by the price of cannabis. The market price of Common Shares may be subject to wide price fluctuations, and the price of TerrAscendʼs shares and its financial results may be significantly and adversely affected by a decline in the price of cannabis. There is currently no established market price for cannabis and the price of cannabis is affected by several factors beyond TerrAscendʼs control. For example, price fluctuations may be in response to many factors, including variations in the operating results of TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, divergence in financial results from analysts’ expectations, changes in earnings estimates by stock market analysts, changes in the business prospects for TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, general economic conditions, legislative changes, community support for the cannabis industry and other events and factors outside of TerrAscendʼs control. In addition, stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which, as well as general economic and political conditions, could adversely affect the market price for TerrAscend’s Common Shares. Additional issuances of TerrAscend’s securities may result in dilution. TerrAscend may issue additional securities in the future, which may dilute a TerrAscend shareholder’s holdings in TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs Articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of Proportionate Voting Shares, Exchangeable Shares, Preferred Shares and Common Shares, and TerrAscend shareholders will have no pre-emptive rights in connection with such further issuance. For example, in connection with the recently completed Transaction with Gage, TerrAscend issued approximately 51.3 million Common Shares to Gage shareholders and reserved approximately an additional 25.8 million Common Shares pursuant to the convertible securities of Gage which will be exchanged for convertible securities of TerrAscend. The directors of TerrAscend have discretion to determine the price and the terms of issue of further issuances, and such terms could include rights, preferences and privileges superior to those existing holders. Moreover, additional Common Shares will be issued by TerrAscend on the exercise of options under TerrAscendʼs stock option plan and upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and upon the conversion of Proportionate Voting Shares, Exchangeable Shares and Preferred Shares. To the extent holders of TerrAscend’s stock options or other convertible securities convert or exercise their securities and sell Common Shares they receive, the trading price of the Common Shares may decrease due to the additional amount of Common Shares available in the market. TerrAscend cannot predict the size or nature of future issuances or the effect that future issuances and sales of Common Shares will have on the market price of the Common Shares. Issuances of a substantial number of additional Common Shares, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Shares. With any additional issuance of Common Shares, investors will suffer dilution to their voting power and economic interest in TerrAscend. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Common Shares. Sales of a substantial number of Common Shares in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of Common Shares intend to sell Common Shares, could reduce the market price of Common Shares. 47 TerrAscend’s management will continue to have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds TerrAscend receives in its public offerings, private placements, warrant exercises and loans, as applicable, and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. TerrAscend’s management will continue to have broad discretion to use the net proceeds from its public offerings, private placements warrant exercises and loans, as applicable, and you will be relying on the judgment of TerrAscend’s management regarding the application of these proceeds. TerrAscend’s management might not apply TerrAscend’s net proceeds in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine its use of the remaining net proceeds from TerrAscend’s public offerings and other financing transactions, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. If TerrAscend does not invest or apply the net proceeds from its public offerings, private placements, warrant exercises and loans in ways that enhance shareholder value, it may fail to achieve the expected financial results, which could cause its share price to decline. Risks related to potential disqualification of equity holders by regulatory authorities. An individual with an ownership interest in TerrAscend could become disqualified from having such ownership interest in TerrAscend under a U.S. state cannabis agency’s interpretation of the relevant state laws and regulations if such owner is convicted of a certain type of felony or fails to meet the residency requirements, if any, for owning equity in a company like TerrAscend. The loss of such equity holder could potentially have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. TerrAscend does not intend to pay dividends on its Common Shares for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of TerrAscend’s Common Shares. TerrAscendʼs policy is to retain earnings to finance the development and enhancement of its products and to otherwise reinvest in TerrAscendʼs businesses. Therefore, TerrAscend does not anticipate paying cash dividends on Common Shares in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of TerrAscend’s Board and will depend on, among other things, financial results, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that TerrAscend’s Board may deem relevant. As a result, investors may not receive any return on investment in Common Shares unless they sell them for a share price that is greater than that at which such investors purchased them. “Penny stock” rules may make buying or selling TerrAscend’s securities difficult which may make its securities less liquid and make it harder for investors to buy and sell such securities. Trading in TerrAscend’s securities is subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules and it is anticipated that trading in TerrAscend’s securities will continue to be subject to the penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends TerrAscend’s securities to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements may discourage broker-dealers from recommending transactions in TerrAscend’s securities, which could severely limit the liquidity of such securities and consequently adversely affect the market price for such securities. General Risk Factors TerrAscend may not be able to obtain necessary permits and authorizations. TerrAscend may be required to obtain and maintain certain permits, licenses and approvals in the jurisdictions where its products are manufactured and/or sold. There can be no assurance that TerrAscend will be able to obtain or maintain any necessary licenses, permits or approvals. Any material delay or inability to receive these items is likely to delay and/or inhibit TerrAscendʼs ability to conduct its business, and would have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 48 Due to the uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and other legislation related to COVID-19, and their application to businesses substantially similar to TerrAscend there is a risk that failure to comply with the legislation may negatively impact TerrAscend and businesses substantially similar to TerrAscend. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Securities Act (""CARES Act"") was signed into law, aimed at providing emergency assistance and health care for individuals, families, and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and generally supporting the U.S. economy. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, and modifications to the net interest deduction limitations. In December 2022, TerrAscend filed for an Employee Retention Tax Credit (“ERC”) distribution in the amount of approximately $14,903. ERC distributions are refundable tax credits for 50% of qualified wages paid to employees during the pandemic. A company is eligible for the ERC if it has not received a Paycheck Protection Program loan under the Cares Act and (1) its operations have been fully or partially suspended because of COVID-19 or (2) its gross receipts in a calendar quarter in 2020 declined by more than 50% from the same period in 2019. No formal determination regarding the claim for the ERC has been received. Due to the potential uncertainty regarding the implementation of the CARES Act and other stimulus legislation, and due to the nature of our business, there is a risk that failure to comply with the legislation may negatively impact TerrAscend and businesses substantially similar to TerrAscend. TerrAscend may be subject to litigation, which could divert the attention of management and cause TerrAscend to expend significant resources. TerrAscend may become party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business which could adversely affect its business. Should any litigation in which TerrAscend becomes involved be determined against TerrAscend, such a decision could adversely affect TerrAscendʼs ability to continue operating and the market price for Common Shares. Even if TerrAscend is involved in litigation and wins, litigation can redirect significant resources. TerrAscend faces risks and hazards that may not be covered by insurance. TerrAscendʼs business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally, including adverse environmental conditions, accidents, disputes and changes in the regulatory environment. Such occurrences could result in damage to assets, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in operations, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although TerrAscend maintains insurance to protect against certain risks in such amounts as it considers to be reasonable, its insurance does not cover all the potential risks associated with its operations. TerrAscend may also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability. Moreover, insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards encountered in the operations of TerrAscend is not generally available on acceptable terms. Losses from these events may cause TerrAscend to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon its financial performance and results of operations. TerrAscend has incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company in Canada and the United States, and its management will continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. TerrAscend’s Common Shares are listed on the CSE under the trading symbol “TER.” The Common Shares also trade over the counter in the United States on OTCQX under the trading symbol “TRSSF.” As a public company, TerrAscend incurs substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that it did not incur as a private company. For example, TerrAscend is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Exchange Act and Securities Act (Ontario) require, among other things, that TerrAscend file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to its business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increase TerrAscend’s legal and financial compliance costs and increase demand on its systems, particularly after TerrAscend is no longer an emerging growth company. In addition, as a public company, TerrAscend may be subject to shareholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management and impact the manner in which TerrAscend operates its business in ways it cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, TerrAscend’s business and financial condition are more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. TerrAscend is currently an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to the extent TerrAscend has taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements 49 available to emerging growth companies, this could make its securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare the company’s performance with other public companies. TerrAscend is an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and TerrAscend may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in TerrAscend’s periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, TerrAscend’s shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. TerrAscend could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause TerrAscend to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of its Common Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30, in which case TerrAscend would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. TerrAscend cannot predict whether investors will find its securities less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find TerrAscend’s securities less attractive as a result of its reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of its securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for the securities and the trading prices of its securities may be more volatile. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. TerrAscend has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, TerrAscend, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of TerrAscend’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 50 Item 2. Properties TerrAscend's corporate headquarters is located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and it has various other offices, manufacturing, cultivation and/or processing facilities and dispensaries across the United States. TerrAscend believes that its current offices and facilities are suitable and adequate to meet its current needs. TerrAscend intends to add new facilities or expand existing facilities as it adds employees, and it believes that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any such expansion of TerrAscend's operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of TerrAscend's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with TerrAscend's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to TerrAscend's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth under ""Risk Factors"", its actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the following discussion and analysis. Unless otherwise noted, dollar amounts in this Item 2 are in thousands of U.S. dollars. Overview TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated licensed operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Maryland and California, and is a cannabis retailer in Ontario, Canada with a minority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent and high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use markets. Notwithstanding the fact that various states in the U.S. have implemented medical marijuana laws or that have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. TerrAscend operates under one operating segment, which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend owns a portfolio of operating businesses and several synergistic brands including: TerrAscend’s head office and registered office is located at 3610 Mavis Road, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, L5C 1W2. TerrAscend’s telephone number is 1.855.837.7295 and its website is www.terrascend.com . Information contained on or accessible through TerrAscend’s website is not a part of this Annual Report, and the inclusion of TerrAscend’s website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is an inactive textual reference only. 59 Recent Developments Subsequent Transactions Components of Results of Operations The following discussion sets forth certain components of our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss as well as factors that impact those items. Revenue TerrAscend generates revenue from the sale of cannabis products, brands, and services to the United States and Canadian markets. Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales in the medical and legal adult use market across Canada and in several U.S. states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or adult use. Cost of sales Cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to providing cannabis products and services to TerrAscend's customers, including personnel-related expenses, the depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other overhead costs. General and administrative General and administrative (""G&A"") consists primarily of personnel costs related to finance, human resources, legal, and other administrative functions. Additionally G&A expense includes professional fees to third parties, as well as marketing expenses. 60 In addition, G&A expense includes share-based compensation on options, restricted stock units and warrants. TerrAscend expects that G&A expense will increase in absolute dollars as the business grows. Amortization and depreciation Amortization and depreciation includes the amortization of intangible assets. Amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over the following terms: Brand intangibles- indefinite lives Indefinite useful lives or 3 years Brand intangibles- definite lives 3 years Software 5 years Licenses 5-30 years Customer relationships 5 years Non-compete agreements 3 years Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms: Buildings and improvements Lesser of useful life or 30 years Land Not depreciated Machinery & equipment 5-15 years Office furniture & production equipment 3-5 years Right of use assets Lease term Assets in process Not depreciated Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. TerrAscend first performs a qualitative assessment. If based on the results of a qualitative assessment it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment test is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, TerrAscend performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration As a result of some of its acquisitions, TerrAscend recognizes a contingent consideration payable, which is an obligation to transfer additional assets to the seller if future events occur. The liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period to determine its fair value. A gain or loss is recognized as a result of the revaluation. (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement by issuing 18,679 convertible preferred stock units, each unit consisting of one non-voting, non-participating preferred share and one preferred share warrant 61 (""Preferred Warrant""). The Preferred Warrants were recorded as a warrant liability and are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting unit using the Black Scholes model. A gain or loss is recognized as a result of the revaluation. Finance and other expenses Finance and other expenses consists primarily of interest expense on TerrAscend's outstanding debt obligations. Transaction and restructuring costs Transaction costs include costs incurred in connection with TerrAscend's acquisitions, such as expenses related to professional fees, consulting, legal and accounting. Restructuring costs are those costs associated with severance and restructuring of business units. Impairment of property and equipment TerrAscend evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When TerrAscend determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss represents the loss recognized on the remeasurement of USD denominated cash and other assets recorded in the Canadian dollars functional currency at TerrAscend's Canadian operations. Unrealized and realized gain on investments TerrAscend accounts for its investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a valuation technique which maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs, with subsequent holding changes in fair value recognized in unrealized gain or loss on investments in the consolidated statement of loss. Provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which TerrAscend conducts business. Results from Operations - Years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 The following tables represent TerrAscend’s results from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020: Revenue, net For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Revenue $ 249,258 $ 201,076 $ 139,118 Excise and cultivation taxes (1,429 ) $ (6,866 ) (6,966 ) Revenue, net $ 247,829 $ 194,210 $ 132,152 $ change $ 53,619 $ 62,058 % change 28 % 47 % The increase in net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was due to an increase of $96,900 in retail sales from $87,119 at December 31, 2021 to $184,019 at December 31, 2022. The increase in revenue was mainly due to adult use sales in New Jersey, which commenced during 2022, as well as the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition. Retail dispensaries increased from thirteen at December 31, 2021 to thirty-one at December 31, 2022. The increase was partially offset by the decrease of $43,281 in wholesale revenue from $107,091 at December 31, 2021 to $63,810 at December 31, 2022, which was mainly related to challenging market dynamics in Pennsylvania. 62 The increase in net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was due to an increase of $42,410 in retail sales from $44,709 at December 31, 2020 to $87,119 at December 31, 2021, and an increase of $19,648 in wholesale sales from $87,443 at December 31, 2020 to $107,091 at December 31, 2021. The increase in retail sales was primarily a result of the increase in retail dispensaries across Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey, which increased from nine at December 31, 2020 to thirteen at December 31, 2021. The increase in wholesale sales was primarily a result of the initial ramp up in New Jersey, expansion in Pennsylvania, as well as the acquisition of HMS. Cost of Sales For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Cost of sales $ 137,243 $ 79,465 $ 46,461 Impairment and write downs of inventory 9,082 2,243 - Total cost of sales $ 146,325 $ 81,708 $ 46,461 $ change $ 64,617 $ 35,247 % change 79 % 76 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 59 % 41 % 42 % The increase in cost of sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was driven mainly by the Gage Acquisition, as well as an increase in New Jersey due to the increase in adult use sales which commenced during 2022. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was due to lower volumes in Pennsylvania leading to under-absorption, primarily related to lower wholesale flower sales, operational challenges at TerrAscend's cultivation facility in Frederick, Maryland as TerrAscend transitioned to its Hagerstown location, and higher costs of sales as a percentage of revenue as a result of the acquisition of Gage in Michigan. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend wrote down its inventory by $9,082 mainly due to write downs of inventory to lower of cost or market which was related to TerrAscend's operational reconfiguration of its cultivation facility in Pennsylvania and write downs of inventory related to the vape recall in Pennsylvania. During the year ended December 31, 2021, TerrAscend recorded impairment of $2,243 mainly related to inventory at its Pennsylvania operations that did not meet quality standards. The increase in cost of sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was a result of the increased volume of sales. General and Administrative Expense (G&A) For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 General and administrative expense $ 115,588 $ 75,107 $ 60,763 $ change $ 40,481 $ 14,344 % change 54 % 24 % G&A excluding share-based compensation $ 103,426 $ 60,165 $ 50,688 G&A excluding share-based compensation as a % of revenue 42 % 30 % 36 % The increase in G&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to increased office and general expense of $15,909, increased salary and wages of $14,558, and increased sales and marketing of $8,460 mainly as a result of the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition. The increase in G&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of increased salaries and wages of $11,464, mainly as a result of the increase in U.S. operations. Additionally, TerrAscend recognized an increase in share-based compensation expense of $4,867, primarily due to the greater number of options granted to new employees during the latter half of 2020, resulting in higher expenses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as well as expense related to the acceleration of options related to severance. In addition, TerrAscend paid $1,590 in one-time legal settlements during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in G&A expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was partially reduced by a decrease in professional fees from the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of payments due of $7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the 63 granting of certain licenses. Excluding this payment, professional fees increased $5,928 primarily due to legal fees and fees for U.S. filer preparation. Amortization and Depreciation Expense For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Amortization and depreciation $ 9,658 $ 5,533 $ 3,886 $ change $ 4,125 $ 1,647 % change 75 % 42 % The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the Gage and Pinnacle Acquisitions. TerrAscend acquired cultivation and processing, as well as retail licenses which are amortized over a 15-year period. The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily related to additions of property and equipment due to TerrAscend’s cultivation expansions and increase in dispensaries in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California. Impairment of intangible assets For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Impairment of intangible assets $ 140,727 $ 3,633 $ 343 $ change $ 137,094 $ 3,290 % change 3774 % 959 % During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend performed an impairment analysis over its indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition as the changes in the market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were determined to be indicators of impairment. TerrAscend determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of its definite lived retail and cultivation and processing licenses was greater than its fair value, and therefore recorded impairment of $79,462 and $42,065 for the retail license and the cultivation and processing licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to $nil at December 31, 2022. Additionally, TerrAscend recorded impairment of its indefinite lived brand intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition of $19,200, reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to $57,985 at December 31, 2022. The impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 relates to the write-off of intellectual property at TerrAscend’s Arise business. During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend recorded impairment of $343 related to its customer relationships at Arise as a result of its termination of an agreement with one of its wholesale distributors. Impairment of goodwill For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Impairment of goodwill $ 170,357 $ 5,007 $ - $ change $ 165,350 $ 5,007 % change 3302 % During the year ended December 31, 2022, as it was determined that it was more likely than not that the Michigan reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying value, a one-step goodwill quantitative impairment test was performed. As a result of the quantitative test, TerrAscend recorded impairment of goodwill of $170,357 at its Michigan reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and Pinnacle Acquisition, which make up the Michigan reporting unit, to $nil. The impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 relates to TerrAscend’s Florida reporting unit as TerrAscend determined that the estimated cash flows of its Arise business did not support the carrying value of the intangible 64 assets and goodwill. As a result, TerrAscend recorded impairment to reduce the balance of goodwill at its Florida reporting unit to $nil. (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration $ (1,061 ) $ 3,584 $ 18,709 $ change $ (4,645 ) $ (15,125 ) % change -130 % -81 % TerrAscend recognized a gain on revaluation of contingent consideration of $1,061 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a loss of $3,584 during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the KCR Acquisition was reduced to $nil, as it was determined that it was more likely than not that the earnout criteria would not be met. The decrease in the revaluation of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is a result of a reduction in the liability as compared to December 31, 2020 due to payments for the earnout of Ilera of $29,668 made subsequent to December 31, 2020, reducing the amount outstanding. This decrease is partially offset by the accretion of contingent consideration payable, which was recorded at the present value of future payments upon initial recognition. Gain on extinguishment of debt For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Gain on extinguishment of debt $ (4,153 ) $ - $ - $ change $ (4,153 ) $ - % change 100 % 0 % Pursuant to the Canopy Debt Settlement Arrangement, on December 9, 2022, TerrAscend and certain of its subsidiaries extinguished certain debt obligations with the Canopy USA Entities, including all the principal and interest on the amounts outstanding thereunder, in exchange for 24,601,467 Exchangeable Shares of TerrAscend at a notional price of $3.74 (C$5.10) per Exchangeable Share. Additionally, in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging , the 22,474,130 original warrants to acquire Common Shares of TerrAscend were modified at a weighted average exercise price of $4.45 (C$6.07) per Common Share. The Exchangeable Shares and Modified Canopy Warrants were considered in the calculation for extinguishment of the debt obligations, including all principal and interest on the amounts outstanding thereafter (refer to Note 9 included in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). As a result of these transactions, TerrAscend recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $4,153 for the year ended December 31, 2022. (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset $ (58,523 ) $ (57,904 ) $ 110,518 $ change $ (619 ) $ (168,422 ) % change 1 % -152 % The warrant liability has been remeasured to fair value at December 31, 2022 using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model (""Black Scholes Model""). TerrAscend recognized a gain during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the reduction of TerrAscend's share price from December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2022, as well as from warrants exercised during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $59,341 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the purchase option derivative asset was remeasured to fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model resulting in a loss of $818. 65 The warrant liability has been remeasured to fair value at December 31, 2021 using the Black Scholes Model. TerrAscend recognized a gain during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the reduction of TerrAscend’s share price from December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2021, as well as from warrants exercised during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $58,158 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the purchase option derivative asset was remeasured to fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model resulting in a loss of $254.

This increase in finance and other expense was offset by other income of $9,440 related to employee retention credits (""ERC"") received as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Securities Act (""CARES Act"") which provides for a refundable tax credit for businesses that continued to pay employees while shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic or had significant declines in gross receipts from March 13, 2020 to December 31, 2021. The increase in finance and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily due to a full year of interest expense of $18,213 related to the Ilera term loan and Canopy Growth Arise loan issued in December 2020, as compared to $674 during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, TerrAscend recorded a reduction to the indemnification asset related to the Apothecarium’s tax audit settlement and statute expirations for tax years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2015 in the amount of $4,504 included in finance and other expenses, with an offset recorded to reduce TerrAscend’s income tax provision (refer to “Provision for income taxes” below).

The increase in transaction and restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily due to higher legal costs related to the acquisitions of KCR and HMS and the pending acquisition of Gage. The transaction and restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 are related to acquisition costs for State Flower and Preferred Share issuance costs.

The increase in unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is a result of the remeasurement of U.S. denominated cash and other assets recorded in Canadian dollar functional currency at TerrAscend’s Canadian operations. Unrealized and realized gain on investments For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Unrealized and realized gain on investments $ (43 ) $ (6,192 ) $ (533 ) $ change $ 6,149 $ (5,659 ) % change -99 % 1062 % The gain on investment during the year ended December 31, 2022 was related to the revaluation of the investments acquired through the Gage Acquisition.

The unrealized gain for the year ended December 31, 2020 relates to the equity income pick-up from TerrAscend’s 10% investment in KCR. Provision for income taxes For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Provision for income taxes $ (10,783 ) $ 28,877 $ 10,769 $ change $ (39,660 ) $ 18,108 % change -137 % 168 % The decrease in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is primarily related to the pre-tax book loss due to the impairment of goodwill taken during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company's effective tax rate was 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 64.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily driven by the impairment of goodwill and the increase in the valuation allowance. TerrAscend's effective tax rate can vary each reporting period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of TerrAscend's earnings, changes to the valuation allowance, and permanently non-deductible expenses. Certain of these 67 and other factors, including TerrAscend's history and projections of pre-tax earnings, are considered in assessing TerrAscend's ability to realize any deferred tax assets including net operating losses. The increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is related to operational scale up. Liquidity and Capital Resources December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 $ $ Cash and cash equivalents 26,158 79,642 Current assets 121,993 172,489 Non-current assets 579,594 409,446 Current liabilities 137,905 66,187 Non-current liabilities 242,511 286,794 Working capital (15,912 ) 106,302 Total shareholders' equity 321,171 228,954 The calculation of working capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. TerrAscend defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP. Liquidity and going concern At December 31, 2022, TerrAscend had an accumulated deficit of $618.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $299.4 million, which primarily related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in its Michigan business of $311.1 million and generated negative cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 of $26.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $26.2 million at December 31, 2022. TerrAscend expects that it will need additional capital to continue to fund its operations. TerrAscend's cash flow and net losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 are indicators that raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. TerrAscend believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including (i) identifying access to future capital, (ii) continued sales growth from TerrAscend's consolidated operations, and (iii) various actions that were implemented during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 leading to general and administrative expense reductions and other cost and efficiency improvements. Since its inception, TerrAscend's primary sources of capital have been through the issuance of equity securities or debt facilities, and TerrAscend has received aggregate net proceeds from such transactions totaling $608,315 as of December 31, 2022. TerrAscend expects to fund any additional future requirements through the following sources of capital: Capital requirements TerrAscend has $205,320 in principal amounts of loans payable at December 31, 2022. Of this amount, $54,232 are due in the next twelve months. TerrAscend has entered into leases for certain premises and offices for which it owes monthly lease payments. TerrAscend has $75,812 in lease obligations. Of this amount, $6,139 are due in the next twelve months. Additionally, TerrAscend makes 68 monthly payments on financing obligations on six of its real estate properties with $15,632 payable, $1,915 of which is due in the next twelve months. Through the acquisition of AMMD, TerrAscend has capital commitments at December 31, 2022 of $10,000 to purchase all the outstanding equity, which is due in the next twelve months. In addition, TerrAscend's undiscounted contingent consideration payable is $5,184 at December 31, 2022. The contingent consideration payable relates to TerrAscend's business acquisitions of the Apothecarium, State Flower and Pinnacle and is due in the next twelve months. Contingent Consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the agreement. The contingent consideration is revalued at the end of each reporting period. During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend expensed $7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses. The final payment of $3,750 is due on or before March 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $44,286 and corporate income taxes payable of $23,077. TerrAscend does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on TerrAscend's results of operations or financial condition, including and without limitation, such consideration as liquidity and capital resources. TerrAscend intends to meet its capital commitments through any or all of the sources of capital noted above. TerrAscend's objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance future obligations. Debt facilities Canopy USA loans Canopy Growth (formerly RIV Capital loan) On February 5, 2020, TerrAscend and RIV Capital Inc. (“RIV Capital”), formerly Canopy Rivers Inc., agreed to amend the terms of their previously issued convertible debentures with a face value of $10,000. Pursuant to the amended terms, the first tranche of the convertible debentures was converted into a $10,000 loan payable bearing interest at a rate of 6% per annum, payable annually, with a balance due date of October 2, 2024. The effective interest rate on the loan is 15.99%. TerrAscend also issued RIV Capital 2,225,714 common share purchase warrants, exercisable at $4.48 (C$5.95) upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The warrants were issued such that they can be exercised upon maturity of the loan payable in a cashless exercise by offsetting the principal value of the loan payable. The amendment was treated as a modification of the convertible debenture and as a result, no gains or losses were recorded for the transaction. The fair value of the debt was calculated using the effective interest rate method and allocated the proceeds of the issuance to the debenture and the warrants based on their relative fair values as determined at issuance. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Canopy Growth acquired the common share purchase warrants previously issued to RIV Capital as well as the loan payable outstanding balance. On December 9, 2022, the Company entered into a debt settlement agreement (the ""Canopy Debt Settlement Agreement"") with Canopy USA, LLC, Canopy USA I Limited Partnership and Canopy USA III Limited Partnership (collectively, the ""Canopy USA Entities""), pursuant to which agreement certain obligations under all of the outstanding loans, plus accrued interest, with the Canopy USA Entities were extinguished in exchange for 24,601,467 exchangeable shares of the Company (""Exchangeable Shares"") at a notional price of $3.74 (C$5.10) per Exchangeable Share. Additionally, in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging , the 22,474,130 original warrants to acquire common shares of the Company (the ""Common Shares"") were modified (the ""Modified Canopy Warrants"") at a weighted average exercise price of $4.45 (C$6.07). The Exchangeable Shares and Modified Canopy Warrants were considered in the calculation for extinguishment of the debt obligations, including all principal and interest on the amounts outstanding thereunder. The Exchangeable Shares and Modified Canopy Warrants can be converted to Common Shares at Canopy USA's option, subject to the federal legalization of marijuana in the United States and compliance with applicable exchange listing rules. Canopy 2020 Debenture 69 On March 10, 2020, TerrAscend Canada Inc. entered into a secured debenture with Canopy USA III Limited Partnership (""Canopy USA III LP""), as successor to Canopy Growth Corporation, whereby it promised to pay to Canopy USA III LP in the amount of $58,645 (""Canopy 2020 Debenture"").

On November 11, 2022, TerrAscend Canada Inc. and Canopy USA III LP entered into an agreement, whereby Canopy USA III Limited Partnership agreed to a waiver of TerrAscend Canada Inc.'s obligation to maintain the minimum current assets set forth in the Canopy 2020 Debenture for the period commencing August 31, 2022 to (and including) November 30, 2022, subject to certain conditions. As stated above, on December 9, 2022, TerrAscend entered into an arrangement with Canopy USA, LLC in which the outstanding loan balance of the Canopy 2020 Debenture was converted into Exchangeable Shares and Modified Canopy Warrants. Canopy Arise Debenture On December 10, 2020, TerrAscend, through a wholly owned subsidiary Arise Bioscience Inc. (“Arise”) entered into a loan financing agreement with Canopy Growth in the amount of $20,000 pursuant to a secured debenture (""Canopy Arise Debenture""). In connection with the funding of the loan, TerrAscend has issued 2,105,718 common share purchase warrants to Canopy Growth. The secured debenture bears interest at a rate of 6.10% per annum commencing four years from the effective date, with an effective interest rate of 15.61%, and matures on December 9, 2030.

The fair value of the debt was calculated using the effective interest rate method and allocated the proceeds of the issuance to the debenture and the warrants based on their relative fair values as determined at issuance. As stated above, on December 9, 2022, TerrAscend entered into an arrangement with Canopy USA, LLC in which the outstanding loan balance of the Canopy Arise Debenture was converted into Exchangeable Shares and Modified Canopy Warrants. Other Loans Manufacturing facility loan On June 19, 2020, TerrAscend completed a $5,336 loan financing secured by its manufacturing facility in Mississauga, bearing interest of 8.25% and a balance due date of June 30, 2023. The mortgage payable was recorded at its fair value at inception and subsequently carried at amortized cost. This loan was included in current liabilities from discontinued operations on TerrAscend's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as this loan is secured by assets held for sale as a result of discontinued operations in TerrAscend Canada (refer to Note 6 included in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). Ilera Term Loan On December 18, 2020, WDB Holding PA, a subsidiary of TerrAscend, entered into a senior secured term loan with a syndicate of lenders in the amount of $120,000 (""Ilera Term Loan""). The term loan bears interest at 12.875% per annum and matures on 70 December 17, 2024. TerrAscend has the ability to increase the facility by up to $30,000. WDB Holding PA's obligation under the Ilera Term Loan and related transaction documents are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of WDB Holding PA, and secured by TerrAscend USA Inc.'s equity interest in WDB Holding PA and substantially all of the assets of WDB Holding PA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto. The loan can be refinanced at the option of the borrower after 18 months from the closing date subject to a premium payment due. Of the total proceeds received, $105,767 was used to satisfy the remaining Ilera earn-out payments. On April 28, 2022, the Ilera Term Loan was amended to provide WDB Holding PA with greater flexibility by resetting the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio levels that must be satisfied at the end of each measurement period and extending the date in which WDB Holding PA is required to deliver its budget for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. In addition, the no-call period was extended from 18 months to 30 months, subject to a premium payment. This modification was not considered extinguishments of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On November 11, 2022, WDB Holding PA, TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors party to the Ilera Term Loan and the PA Agent (on behalf of the required lenders) entered into an amendment to the PA Credit Agreement, pursuant to which PA Agent and the required lenders agreed that WDB Holding PA's obligation to maintain the consolidated interest coverage ratio as set forth in the PA Credit Agreement for the period ended September 30, 2022, shall not apply, subject to certain conditions, including (but not limited to) an obligation to enter into a subsequent amendment agreement on or before December 15, 2022, documenting certain enhancements and amendments to the PA Credit Agreement to be agreed.

TerrAscend agreed to make a $35,000 payment at the original prepayment price of 103.22% to par, and agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to add certain collateral to Ilera Term Loan, collectively by March 15, 2023. The amendment further provided that should WDB Holding PA not maintain the prescribed interest coverage ratio, the Company shall be required to deposit funds, as outlined in the amendment, into a restricted account, and no event of default shall occur. This amendment was not considered extinguishments of debt under ASC 470 Debt . There is $115,000 of principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022. On March 15, 2023, WDB Holding PA, in exchange for a fee in the amount of 1% of the then outstanding principal loan balance, agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the obligation date to prepay TerrAscend's debt from March 15, 2023 to June 30, 2023 in which WDB Holding PA must use commercially reasonable efforts to add additional collateral to the Ilera Term Loan, (ii) increase the amount of debt to be reduced by up to $37,000, subject to certain reductions in amount based on meeting certain time based milestones, at a prepayment price of 103.22% to par, and (iii) extend the next test date in respect of the interest coverage ratio until June 30, 2023. HMS loan The acquisition of HMS included a $2,500 note payable which bears a 5.0% annual interest, due October 2022. The note was recorded at its fair value at inception of $2,089 and subsequently carried at amortized cost. TerrAscend made payments of principal and interest of $2,351, reducing the balance to $nil at December 31, 2022 and the note is no longer outstanding. KCR Loan The acquisition of KCR included a $6,750 note payable which bears interest at 10.00% per annum and matures on April 30, 2022. The note was recorded at its fair value at inception and subsequently carried at amortized cost. TerrAscend made payments of principal and interest of $2,324 and $4,878 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the note is no longer outstanding. Gage Loans The Gage Acquisition included a senior secured term loan (the ""Original Gage Term Loan"") with an acquisition date fair value of $53,857. The credit agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate plus 7% or (ii) 10.25%. The term loan is payable monthly and matures on November 30, 2022. The term loan is secured by a first lien on all Gage assets. On August 10, 2022, the Original Gage Term Loan was amended as a result of the corporate restructure in conjunction with the Gage Acquisition. The amendment to the Original Gage Term Loan includes the addition of a borrower and guarantor under 71 the term loan and a right of first offer in favor of the administrative agent for a refinancing of the term loan. This amendment was not considered extinguishments of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On November 29, 2022, TerrAscend repaid $30,000 outstanding principal amount on the Original Gage Term Loan. On November 30, 2022, the remaining loan principal amount of $25,000 on the Original Gage Term Loan was amended (the ""Amended Gage Term Loan""). The Amended Gage Term Loan bears interest on $25,000 at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the U.S. ""prime rate"" plus 6.00%, and (ii) 13.0% and matures on November 1, 2024. Commencing on May 31, 2023, TerrAscend will make monthly principal repayments of 0.40% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Additionally, the unpaid principal amount of the loan shall bear paid in kind interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum. No prepayment fees are owed if TerrAscend voluntarily prepays the loan after 18 months. If such prepayment occurs prior to 18 months, a prepayment fee equal to all of the interest on the loans that would be due after the date of such prepayment, is owed. Under the Amended Gage Term Loan, TerrAscend has the ability to borrow incremental term loans of $30,000 at the option of TerrAscend and subject to consents from the required lenders. The additional $30,000 incremental term loans available under the amendment have not been drawn as of December 31, 2022. This loan represents a loan syndication, and therefore TerrAscend assessed each of the lenders separately under ASC 470 Debt to determine if this represents a modification, or an extinguishment of debt. For three of the four remaining lenders, it was determined that this was a modification. For the remaining lender, it was determined that this represented an extinguishment of debt and therefore the fees paid to the lenders on modification were expensed. As a result of this transaction, TerrAscend expensed $1,907 of fees paid to the lenders and third parties as they did not meet the criteria for capitalization under ASC 470 Debt . Additionally, the Gage Acquisition included a loan payable to a former owner of a licensed entity with an acquisition date fair value of $2,683, and a promissory note with an acquisition date fair value of $4,065. The loan payable to the former owner bears interest at a rate of 0.2%. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 6%. There is $5,152 of principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022 on the loan payable and promissory note. Pinnacle Loans The Pinnacle Acquisition purchase price included two promissory notes in an aggregate amount of $10,000 to pay down all Pinnacle liabilities and encumbrances. The promissory note matures on June 30, 2023 and bears interest rates of 6%. There is $9,333 of principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022 on the two promissory notes. Pelorus Term Loan On October 11, 2022, subsidiaries of TerrAscend, among others, entered into a loan agreement with Pelorus Fund REIT, LLC (""Pelorus"") for a single-draw senior secured term loan (""Pelorus Term Loan"") in an aggregate principal amount of $45,478. The Pelorus Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate tied to the one month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), subject to a base rate, plus 9.5%, with interest-only payments for the first 36 months. The base rate is defined as, on any day, the greatest of (i) 2.5%, (b) the effective federal funds rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%, and (c) one month SOFR in effect on such day. The obligations of the borrowers under the Pelorus Term Loan are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and certain other subsidiaries of TerrAscend and secured by substantially all of the assets of TerrAscend's Maryland and New Jersey businesses, including certain real estate in Maryland and New Jersey. The Pelorus Term Loan matures on October 11, 2027. There is $45,478 of principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022. Cash Flows Cash flows used in operating activities For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Net cash used in operating activities $ (26,123 ) $ (31,815 ) $ (36,971 ) The decrease in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to a decrease in income taxes paid from $37,060 during the year ended December 31, 2021 to $9,917 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as a decrease in contingent consideration payments made related to TerrAscend's acquisitions in excess of the fair value of the liability recognized at the date of acquisition from $11,394 during the year ended December 31, 2021 to $410 during the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding these amounts, TerrAscend had net cash 72 used in operating activities of $15,795 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $16,639 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is due to an increase in loss from operations, excluding non-cash impairment on intangible assets and goodwill, of $56,381 from a profit of $31,550 in the prior year period to a loss of $24,831 in the current year. The decrease in cash used in operating activities is offset by an increase in interest payments made on loans from $21,171 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $26,840 for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the loans acquired through the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition. The decrease in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, is primarily due to payments made in excess of the amount of fair value of the contingent consideration payable at the date of the Ilera acquisition on September 16, 2019 of $11,394 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to payments of $56,527 during the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding these amounts, TerrAscend had net cash used in operating activities of $20,421 and cash provided by operating activities of $19,556 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase in cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 is mainly the result of income tax payments of $37,060 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $11,204 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and interest payments of $21,171 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1,955 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest payments is primarily due to the Ilera term loan in which TerrAscend received proceeds during December 2020. Excluding these payments, TerrAscend saw an increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, which is primarily due to increased sales. Cash flows used in investing activities For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Net cash used in investing activities $ (27,579 ) $ (132,421 ) $ (45,890 ) The net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily relates to investment in property and equipment of $39,631, primarily related to the buildout of a cultivation site in Maryland, continuing renovations at TerrAscend's Pennsylvania cultivation site, cash expenditures at its grow, production and packaging facilities in Michigan, and the continued buildout of TerrAscend's Lodi alternative treatment center in New Jersey. Additionally, TerrAscend had investments in intangible assets of $2,261, primarily related to adult use licenses in New Jersey, as well as the acquisition of a retail license in Michigan. The cash used in investing activities is offset by cash inflows of $24,716 related to cash and restricted cash acquired through the Gage Acquisition, offset by net cash paid for consideration for the Pinnacle Acquisition of $8,489. The net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relates to cash consideration paid for the acquisitions of KCR and HMS totaling $42,736.

Additionally, TerrAscend had investments in property and equipment of $37,858 primarily related to the buildout of the New Jersey operations and expansions in Pennsylvania cultivation and $1,977 related to deposits paid for the expansion of the cultivation premises in Pennsylvania. In comparison, the net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to investments in property and equipment of $43,784 primarily relating to the buildout of the New Jersey operations and expansions in Pennsylvania and California cultivation. Cash flows from financing activities For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 3,719 $ 182,201 $ 133,251 Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to loan proceeds in the amount of $43,419 and proceeds from exercises of Common Share warrants and stock options of $24,342.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, was mainly a result of the private placement on January 28, 2021, in which TerrAscend issued 18,115,656 Common Shares at a price of $9.64 (C$12.35) per 73 Common Share for total proceeds of $173,477, net of share issuance costs of $1,643. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 8,755,339 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of $21,735 and 1,376,496 stock options were exercised at $0.67-$6.93 (C$0.85-$8.52) per unit for total gross proceeds of $5,462. In addition, 1,968 Preferred Share warrants were exercised at $3,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of $3,588. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Ilera of $18,274 and by payments of loan principal of $4,500 related to the KCR loan. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to loan proceeds in the amount of $196,348 and proceeds from private placements net of share issuance costs of $71,023. Additionally, 829,050 Common Share warrants were exercised for total gross proceeds of $2,075 and 1,816,496 stock options were exercised at $0.43-$6.52 per unit for total gross proceeds of $4,462. In addition, 625 Preferred Share warrants were exercised at $3,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of $750. The cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by payments of contingent consideration of $90,657 to the sellers of Ilera, as well as payments of principal on TerrAscend’s outstanding loans of $48,893 to pay off the remaining balance of the JW Asset Management credit facility, a financing loan in Canada, and the loans from management of Ilera. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, TerrAscend reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. TerrAscend believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company’s ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and TerrAscend calculates (i) Adjusted gross profit as gross profit adjusted for certain material non-cash items, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments which management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. TerrAscend believes Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful performance measure to assess the performance of TerrAscend as it provides more meaningful ongoing operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of TerrAscend’s underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. The table below reconciles net loss to EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 74 For the years ended Notes December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Net (loss) income $ (325,351 ) $ 6,135 $ (142,256 ) Add (deduct) the impact of: Loss (income) from discontinued operations 25,949 9,518 14,635 Provision for income taxes (10,783 ) 28,877 10,769 Finance expenses 39,059 24,121 8,006 Amortization and depreciation 22,624 12,789 8,337 EBITDA from continuing operations (a) (248,502 ) 81,440 (100,509 ) Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) 2,770 3,465 (230 ) Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) 5,894 449 — Vape recall (d) 2,965 — — Share-based compensation (e) 12,162 14,941 10,475 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (f) 311,084 8,640 343 Impairment of property and equipment and loss on disposal of fixed assets (g) 1,089 312 6 Loss on lease termination and derecognition of ROU asset (h) 1,162 3,278 — (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration (i) (1,061 ) 3,584 18,709 Restructuring costs and executive severance (j) 472 816 556 Legal settlements (k) 623 1,590 — Fees for services related to NJ licenses (l) — — 7,500 Other one-time items (m) 5,207 6,070 584 Bad debt expense write offs in Michigan (n) 9,941 — — Loan modification fees (o) 2,507 — — Employee Retention Credits (p) (9,440 ) — — Gain on extinguishment of debt (q) (4,153 ) — — Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset (r) (58,523 ) (57,904 ) 110,518 Indemnification asset release (s) 3,973 4,504 — Unrealized and realized gain on investments (t) (43 ) (6,192 ) (533 ) Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss (u) 712 4,654 159 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations $ 38,839 $ 69,647 $ 47,578 TerrAscend calculates adjusted gross profit by adjusting gross profit for the one-time relief of fair value of inventory upon acquisition, non-cash write downs of inventory, vape recall, and other one time adjustments to gross profit as TerrAscend does not believe that these impacts are reflective of ongoing operations. The table below reconciles gross profit to adjusted gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: For the years ended Notes December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Gross profit $ 101,504 $ 112,502 $ 85,691 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) 2,770 3,465 (230 ) Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) 5,894 449 - Vape recall (d) 2,965 — — Other one time adjustments to gross profit (v) 798 — — Adjusted gross profit from continuing operations $ 113,931 $ 116,416 $ 85,461 75 76 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to lower volume and resulting gross margin compression mainly related to challenging market dynamics in Pennsylvania. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily due to operational scale up, as well as TerrAscend’s acquisitions of KCR and HMS. TerrAscend continued to expand in the United States organically through an increase in production and wholesale capacity in Pennsylvania, store expansions in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, and operations in New Jersey and Maryland. Changes in or Adoption of Accounting Principles New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted: TerrAscend adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during the year ended December 31, 2022. Information regarding TerrAscend’s adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of TerrAscend’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. While TerrAscend’s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K, the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that TerrAscend considers to be the most critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgement involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the financial condition. A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is available to reasonably estimate the impact and provides material information to investors. Inventory The net realizable value of inventory represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. TerrAscend estimates the net realizable value of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment, including consideration of factors such as shrinkage, the aging of and future demand for inventory, expected future selling price TerrAscend expects to realize by selling the inventory, and the contractual arrangements with customers. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based upon quantities on hand, projected volumes from demand forecasts and net realizable value. The future realization of these inventories may be affected by market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. A change to these assumptions could impact TerrAscend’s inventory valuation and gross profit. Revenue recognition Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales, which are recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the purchaser and the collectability is reasonably assured. From time to time, TerrAscend partakes in sales agreements with suppliers in which it also purchases inventory. As part of the five-step revenue model, TerrAscend assesses whether instances of bulk sales made to suppliers of goods have commercial substance and should be recognized as revenue under ASC 606 Revenue Recognition , or whether the transaction should be assessed under ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions. The determination of whether the sale has commercial substance requires management’s judgment. 77 Share-based compensation In calculating share-based compensation, key estimates are used such as, the rate of forfeiture of options granted, the expected life of the option, the volatility of TerrAscend’s stock price, the vesting period of the option and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. While assumptions used to calculate and account for share-based compensation awards represent management’s best estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if revisions are made to the underlying assumptions and estimates, share based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period. TerrAscend recognized share-based compensation expense of $12,162, $14,942, and $10,475 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Warrant Liability TerrAscend uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of the warrants issued, which includes various unobservable inputs such as the volatility of TerrAscend’s stock price and the risk-free interest rate. TerrAscend uses judgment to select methods used and in performing the fair value calculations at the initial measurement at issuance, as well as for subsequent measurement on a recurring basis. The assumptions could have a material impact on the valuation of the warrant liability. The warrant liability was remeasured to fair value at $711 and $54,986 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. An increase of 50 basis points to the discount rate and volatility would not have a material impact. Income taxes The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized is based on an assessment of the probability of TerrAscend generating future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized. In addition, significant judgment is required in classifying transactions and assessing probable outcomes of tax positions taken, and in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties in various tax jurisdictions. Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. TerrAscend reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. It is possible, however, that at some future date, an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. If the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Impairment of long-lived assets TerrAscend evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right of use (""ROU"") assets, and definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When TerrAscend determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Management judgement is required in the determination of indicators of impairment, as well as the estimation of future undiscounted cash flows, and as necessary, the fair value of those assets or asset groups in which indicators of impairment have been identified. During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend determined that changes in market expectations of cash flows in its Michigan business, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were indicators that an impairment test was appropriate for the Michigan reporting unit. TerrAscend determines the fair value of the asset group and allocates the impairment to the assets, being the (i) cultivation and processing licenses, and (ii) retail licenses, acquired through the Gage Acquisition. TerrAscend compared the carrying value of the assets to its fair value and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for both the retail and the cultivation and processing licenses. As such, TerrAscend recorded impairment charges of $79,462 and $42,065 for the cultivation and processing licenses and retail licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to $nil. TerrAscend recorded impairment of $423 of intellectual property in Canada during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to packaging designs that were written down to its recoverable value. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend recorded impairment of $342 related to its customer relationships at Arise as a result of its termination of an agreement with one of its wholesale distributors. 78 TerrAscend recorded impairment of property and equipment of $1,089, $312, and $6 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. TerrAscend uses an income-based approach as necessary to assess the fair values of intangible assets and its reporting units for goodwill testing purposes. Under the income approach, fair value is based on the present value of estimated cash flows. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the most recent information available. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Determining the value in use requires TerrAscend to estimate expected future cash flows associated with the assets and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts, and market data are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and intangible assets. TerrAscend’s impairment loss calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgement to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting projected financial information and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. If actual results are not consistent with TerrAscend’s estimates and assumptions, TerrAscend may be exposed to non-cash impairment losses that could be material. 2022 During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend determined that the existence of impairment on certain long-lived assets, together with changes in market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state since TerrAscend acquired the indefinite lived assets, indicate that the fair value of the Gage brand intangible assets are more likely than not lower than the carrying value. As such, TerrAscend performed an impairment analysis and determined the fair value of its brand intangible assets using the relief of royalty method. As a result of the quantitative analysis performed, TerrAscend recognized impairment of $19,200, reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to $57,985. Based on the indicators of impairment noted previously, TerrAscend determined that there were indicators that the fair value of its reporting units are more likely than not lower than its carrying value. As such, a quantitative impairment test was performed over its Michigan reporting unit, which includes goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition, its Pennsylvania reporting unit, and its California wholesale reporting unit. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over its Michigan reporting unit, TerrAscend recorded impairment of goodwill of $170,357 during the year ended December 31, 2022, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and Pinnacle Acquisition to $nil. TerrAscend determined that the challenging market dynamics in Pennsylvania, including increased competition, were indicators of impairment for the Pennsylvania reporting unit and therefore TerrAscend performed a quantitative impairment analysis. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over the Pennsylvania reporting unit, TerrAscend determined that the fair value of the Pennsylvania reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Pennsylvania reporting unit was $76,761 at December 31, 2022. TerrAscend determined that increased competition and a reduction in forecasted sales, were indicators of impairment for the California wholesale reporting unit and therefore TerrAscend performed a quantitative impairment analysis. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over TerrAscend's California wholesale reporting unit, it was determined that the fair value of the California reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the California wholesale reporting unit was $4,689 at December 31, 2022. 2021 During the year ended December 31, 2021, TerrAscend made a decision to undertake a strategic review process to explore, review, and evaluate potential alternatives for its Arise business. TerrAscend also determined that the estimated future cash 79 flows for the business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill, and therefore, the intangible assets and goodwill were written down to $nil. TerrAscend recorded impairment of intangible assets of $3,633 and impairment of goodwill of $5,007. During the fourth quarter of 2021, TerrAscend performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for each of its reporting units. TerrAscend determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California and Maryland reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative impairment analysis was performed. TerrAscend performed a quantitative analysis over its Pennsylvania reporting unit and determined that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. An increase of the discount rate of 100 basis points would not cause an impairment. There is no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets at TerrAscend’s Canada reporting unit. 2020 During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for each of its reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California and Pennsylvania reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative analyses was performed. TerrAscend performed a quantitative analysis over its Florida reporting unit and determined that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. An increase in the discount rate of 100 basis points would not cause an impairment. Business combinations Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or an asset acquisition depends on whether the asset acquire constitutes a business, which can be a complex judgement. TerrAscend has determined that its acquisitions in Note 4 are business combinations under ASC 805 Business Combinations . In a business combination, substantially all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. One of the most significant areas of judgment and estimation relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities, including the fair value of contingent consideration, if applicable. If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, TerrAscend may utilize an independent external valuation expert to develop the fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, which are generally based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. These valuations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in the discount rate applied. The estimates are based upon assumptions that TerrAscend believes are reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. Contingent Consideration Contingent consideration payable as the result of a business combination is recorded at the date of acquisition at fair value. The fair value of contingent consideration is subject to significant judgement and estimates, such as projected future revenue. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are measured at each reporting date, with changes recognized through profit or loss. Refer to Note 21 included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the sensitivity analysis performed over the contingent consideration liability. ERC The CARES Act provides for an employee retention credit (""ERC"") which is a refundable tax credit for businesses that continued to pay employees while shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or had significant declines in gross receipts from March 13, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Eligible employers can claim the ERC on an original or adjusted employment tax return for a period within those dates. TerrAscend has elected to account for the credit as a government grant. There is limited grant accounting guidance within U.S. GAAP that is applicable to for-profit entities, therefore, TerrAscend has elected to follow the grant accounting model in International Accounting Standard (""IAS"") 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Accordingly, TerrAscend recognizes government grants for which there is a reasonable assurance of compliance with grant conditions and receipt of credits and has therefore recognized a receivable for the total credit amount on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. The determination of the collectability of the ERC requires significant judgement, including assessment of TerrAscend's eligibility based on the facts and circumstances. While TerrAscend believes that collection of the ERC is probable, there is some uncertainty around collection due to the nature of TerrAscend's industry. 80 During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend has an ERC for qualified wages of $14,903 which was included in accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022. TerrAscend recognized other income of $9,440 as a result of this transaction which was recorded as other income and included in finance and other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, TerrAscend recorded accounts receivable in its opening balance sheet related to the acquisition of Gage of $5,463 related to ERC. Incremental borrowing rates Lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available. If that rate cannot be easily determined, the lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that TerrAscend estimates it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. TerrAscend calculates its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate TerrAscend would pay to borrow funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value over similar terms taking into consideration the economic factors and the credit risk rating at the commencement date of the lease. In addition, TerrAscend utilizes a discount rate to determine the appropriate fair value of convertible debentures and loans issued with warrants attached. The discount rate applied reflects the interest rate that TerrAscend would have to pay to borrow a similar amount at a similar term and with a similar security. Control, joint control or level of influence When determining the appropriate basis of accounting for TerrAscend’s interests in affiliates, TerrAscend makes judgments about the degree of influence that it exerts directly or through an arrangement over the investees’ relevant activities. Emerging Growth Company Status TerrAscend is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. TerrAscend has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that TerrAscend (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, TerrAscend’s consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. TerrAscend will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) (a) December 31, 2027, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which TerrAscend has total annual gross revenue of $1.235 billion or more, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which TerrAscend is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of TerrAscend’s voting and non-voting common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th; and (ii) the date on which TerrAscend has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact TerrAscend’s financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. TerrAscend’s market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation and interest rates. TerrAscend does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. Financial Instruments and Risk Management Financial instruments recorded at fair value are estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities Level 2- inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) from observable market data Level 3- inputs for assets and liabilities not based upon observable market data Risk Management 81 TerrAscend’s risk exposure and the impact on TerrAscend’s financial instruments are summarized below: (a) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to TerrAscend if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject TerrAscend to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and notes receivable. TerrAscend assesses the credit risk of trade receivables by evaluating the aging of trade receivables based on the invoice date. The carrying amounts of trade receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When a trade receivable balance is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for expected credit losses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. TerrAscend regularly monitors credit risk exposure and takes steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in actual loss. TerrAscend has no customers whose balance is greater than 10% of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022. (b) Liquidity risk TerrAscend is exposed to liquidity risk, or the risk that TerrAscend will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. TerrAscend manages liquidity risk through ongoing review of its capital requirements. TerrAscend’s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations. (c) Market Risk The significant market risk exposures to which TerrAscend is exposed are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. i) Foreign currency risk: Foreign currency risk is the risk that a variation in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies will affect TerrAscend’s operations and financial results. TerrAscend and its subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents and other assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency. TerrAscend does not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. Consequently, fluctuations in foreign currencies could have a negative impact on the profitability of TerrAscend's operations. A 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar would result in a change of $2,389 to the unrealized foreign exchange loss (gain). ii) Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. In respect of financial assets, TerrAscend’s policy is to invest excess cash at floating rates of interest in cash equivalents, in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the value of cash equivalents. TerrAscend’s investments in guaranteed investment certificates bear a fixed rate and are cashable at any time prior to maturity date. TerrAscend does not have significant cash equivalents at year. The Amended Gage Term Loan and the Pelorus Term Loan have variable interest rates that are tied to the U.S. ""prime rate"" and SOFR. At December 31, 2022, a 10% change to each of the interest rates would result in a change to interest expense of $1,295. The remainder of TerrAscend’s loans payable have fixed interest rates from 6% to 12.875% per annum. All other financial liabilities are non-interest-bearing instruments. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data All information required by this item may be found on pages F-1 through F-59 of this Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. 82 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, TerrAscend’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by TerrAscend’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. TerrAscend’s management, with the participation of its President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of TerrAscend's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer, determined that TerrAscend’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. Management has excluded Michigan from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because Gage and Pinnacle were acquired by the Company on March 10, 2022 and August 23, 2022, respectively. Michigan's total assets and total revenues represent 15% and 25%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating TerrAscend’s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting TerrAscend’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. TerrAscend’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of its President and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of TerrAscend’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on the results of its assessment, TerrAscend’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of TerrAscend’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting due to its exemption as an emerging growth company. Management’s report was not subject to audit by TerrAscend’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit TerrAscend to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes to TerrAscend’s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d‑15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, TerrAscend's internal controls over financial reporting.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TerrAscend Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered losses from operations, reoccurring net cash used in operating activities and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ MNP LLP Chartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants Toronto, Canada March 16, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.

F- 8 TERRASCEND CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) TerrAscend Corp. (“TerrAscend” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act on March 7, 2017 . TerrAscend provides cannabis products, brands, and services to the United States (“U.S.”) and Canadian cannabinoid markets where cannabis production or consumption has been legalized for therapeutic or adult use. TerrAscend operates a number of synergistic businesses, including Gage Growth (""Gage""), a cultivator, processor and retailer in Michigan; KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings LLC (collectively ""Pinnacle""); The Apothecarium (“The Apothecarium”), a cannabis dispensary with several retail locations in California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; TerrAscend NJ, LLC (""TerrAscend NJ""), a cultivator, processor and retailer with operations in New Jersey; Ilera Healthcare (“Ilera”), Pennsylvania’s medical cannabis cultivator, processor and dispenser; HMS Health, LLC and HMS Processing, LLC (collectively “HMS”), a medical cannabis cultivator and processor based in Maryland; Valhalla Confections, a manufacturer of cannabis-infused edibles; State Flower, a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Francisco; and Arise Bioscience Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of hemp-derived products. Notwithstanding various states in the U.S. which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. The Company has been listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (""CSE"") since May 3, 2017, having the ticker symbol ""TER"" and effective October 22, 2018, the Company began trading on OTCQX under the ticker symbol ""TRSSF"". The Company’s registered office is located at 3610 Mavis Road, Mississauga, Ontario, L5C 1W2. 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (a) Basis of presentation and measurement and going concern These consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) of the Company and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value as described herein. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 618,260 and cash and cash equivalents of $ 26,158 . During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $ 299,402 , which primarily related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in its Michigan business of $ 311,084 (refer to Note 8) and generated negative cash flow from operations of $ 26,123 . The Company's cash flow and net losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 are indicators that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to address its liquidity needs by taking steps to improve its operations and cash position, including (i) identifying access to future capital, (ii) continued sales growth from the Company's consolidated operations, and (iii) various actions that were implemented during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 leading to general and administrative expense reductions and other cost and efficiency improvements. (b) Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of the Company and its Canadian subsidiaries is Canadian dollars (“C$”). The functional currency of the Company’s US subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar (“USD”). The Company’s presentation currency is in USD. All amounts are presented in USD unless otherwise specified. References to C$ are to Canadian dollars. (c) Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company consolidates legal entities in which it holds a controlling financial interest. The Company has a two-tier consolidation model: one focused on voting rights (the voting interest model) and the second focused on a qualitative analysis of power over significant activities and exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits (the variable interest model). All entities are first evaluated to determine whether they are variable interest entities (“VIE”). If an entity is determined not to be a VIE, it is F- 9 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) assessed on the basis of voting and other decision-making rights under the voting interest model. The accounts of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances and transactions were eliminated on consolidation. (d) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand at retail locations, demand deposits with financial institutions and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash held in money market investments are carried at fair value, cash held in financial institution and cash held at retail locations have carrying values that approximate fair value. (e) Inventory Inventories of harvested and purchased finished goods and packaging materials are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is determined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The direct and indirect costs of inventory include materials, labor and depreciation expense on equipment involved in packaging, labeling and inspection. Amortization of acquired cannabis production licenses are also considered to be indirect costs of inventory. All direct and indirect costs related to inventory are capitalized as they are incurred and they are subsequently recorded within cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations at the time cannabis is sold. Products for resale and supplies and consumables are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews inventory for obsolete, redundant, and slow-moving goods, and any such inventories are written down to net realizable value. (f) Property and equipment and long-lived assets held for sale Property and equipment is measured at cost, including capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms: Buildings and improvements Lesser of useful life or 30 years Land Not depreciated Machinery & equipment 5 - 15 years Office furniture & production equipment 3 - 5 years Right of use assets Lease term Assets in process Not depreciated Assets in process are transferred to the appropriate asset type when available for use and depreciation of the assets commences at that point. The Company classified assets and liabilities (the ""disposal group"") as held for sale in the period when all of the relevant criteria to be classified as held for sale are met. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at their estimated fair value less costs to sell. Any loss resulting from the measurement is recognized in the period the held for sale criteria is met. The Company discontinues depreciation on these assets. An asset’s residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that the current estimate or depreciation method are no longer applicable. Changes are adjusted prospectively if appropriate. Gains and losses on disposal of an asset are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the items and are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are recognized when the assets are reclassified as assets held for sale or when impaired as part of an asset group’s impairment. The Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment and long-lived assets held for sale, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. See – Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its property and equipment. F- 10 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) The Company capitalizes interest and borrowing costs on significant qualifying capital construction projects. Upon the asset becoming available for use, capitalization of borrowing costs ceases, and depreciation commences on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset. (g) Leases Leases are classified as operating or finance leases based on the terms of the lease agreement and certain characteristics of the identified assets. The majority of the Company’s leases are operating leases used primarily for corporate offices, retail dispensaries, and cultivation and manufacturing facilities. The operating lease periods range from 1 to 28 years . Additionally, the Company h as three finance leases at December 31, 2022 and one finance lease at December 31, 2021. The lease periods for finance leases range from 18 months to 10 yea rs . The Company’s leases include fixed payments, as well as in some cases, scheduled base rent increases over the term of the lease. Certain leases require variable payments of common area maintenance, operating expenses, and real estate taxes applicable to the property. Variable payments are excluded from the measurements of lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Any tenant improvement allowances received from the lessor are recorded as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. None of the Company’s lease agreements contained residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the contract. Lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term for those arrangements where there is an identified asset and the contract conveys the right to control its use. The right-of-use (“ROU”) asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, and initial direct costs. For operating leases, right-of-use assets are reduced over the lease term by the straight-line expense recognized, less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest rate method. Finance leases are included in property and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales and general and administrative expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Finance lease cost includes amortization, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method and is included in finance and other expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company applies a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. The majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate that can be easily determined, and therefore uses its incremental borrowing rate and the information available at the commencement date (refer to Note 10). Certain leases include one or more options to renew or terminate the lease at the Company’s discretion. The Company regularly evaluates lease renewal and termination options and, when they are reasonably certain of exercise, includes the renewal or termination option in the lease term. The Company evaluates its ROU assets for impairment consistent with its impairment of long-lived assets. See – Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its right-of-use assets. In some instances, the Company subleases excess office space to third party tenants. The Company, as sublessor, continues to account for the head lease. If the lease cost for the term of the sublease exceeds the Company’s anticipated sublease income for the same period, this indicates that the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease should be assessed for impairment under the long-lived asset impairment provisions. Sublease income is included in Finance (expense) income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company accounts for non-lease and lease components to which they relate as a single lease component. Additionally, the Company recognized lease payments under short-term leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, as well as low value assets, as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term without recognizing the lease liability and ROU asset. (h) Goodwill F- 11 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Goodwill is recorded at the time of acquisition and represents the excess of the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. See – Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets. (i) Intangible assets Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives, which do not exceed the contractual period, if any. The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed annually and any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following terms: Brand intangibles- indefinite lives Indefinite useful lives or 3 years Brand intangibles- definite lives 3 years Software 5 years Licenses 5 - 30 years Customer relationships 5 years Non-compete agreements 3 years Licenses relating to cultivation and dispensaries are amortized using a useful life consistent with the property and equipment to which they relate. Intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives, which include brand names, are not subject to amortization but the carrying value is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. See – Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets. (j) Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill The Company operates as one operating segment. For the purposes of testing goodwill, the Company has identified seven reporting units. The Company analyzed its reporting units by first reviewing the operating statements based on geographic areas in which the Company conducts business (or each market). The Company’s reporting units to which goodwill has been assigned include Michigan, Pennsylvania, California- wholesale, California- retail, Florida, Maryland, and Canada. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangibles and reporting unit for goodwill to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. (k) Impairment of long-lived assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, ROU assets, and definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated F- 12 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. F- 13 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) (l) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized by the Company in accordance with ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard requires sales to be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer and at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring those goods or services. This is achieved by applying the following five steps: i) identify the contract with a customer; ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; iii) determine the transaction price; iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and v) recognize sales when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales, which are recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the purchaser and the collectability is reasonably assured. This is generally when goods have been delivered, which is also when the performance obligations have been fulfilled under the terms of the related sales contract. Revenue from retail sales of cannabis to customers for a fixed price is recognized when the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer at the point of sale and the customer has accepted and paid for the goods. Revenue for wholesale sales for a fixed price is recognized upon delivery to the customer. Sales are recorded net of returns and discounts and incentives, but inclusive of freight. Payment is typically due upon transferring the goods to the customer or within a specified time period permitted under the Company’s credit policy. All shipping and handling activities are performed before the customers obtain control of products and are accounted for as cost of sales. From time to time, the Company partakes in sales agreements with suppliers in which it also purchases inventory. As part of the five-step revenue model, the Company assesses whether instances of bulk sales made to suppliers of goods have commercial substance and should be recognized as revenue, or whether they should be assessed under ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions. Local authorities will often impose excise or cultivation taxes on the sale or production of cannabis products. Excise and cultivation taxes are effectively a production tax which become payable when a cannabis product is delivered to the customer and are not directly related to the value of sales. The excise is borne by the Company and is included in revenue. The subtotal “net revenue” on the statements of operations and consolidated loss represents the revenue as defined by ASC 606 Revenue Recognition , minus the excise or cultivation taxes. (m) Business combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is obtained by the Company (see Note 2(c)). The Company measures the consideration transferred, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed in a business combination at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition related costs are recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred, and the services are received, except for the costs to issue debt or equity securities which are recognized according to specific requirements. The excess of the consideration transferred to obtain control, over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration for a business combination is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Contingent consideration that is classified as a liability is measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. If the acquiree’s former owners contractually indemnify the Company for a particular uncertainty, an indemnification asset is recognized on a basis that matches the indemnified item, subject to the contractual provisions or any collectability considerations. (n) Investments The majority of the Company's investments are initially recorded at cost. Management assesses investments for impairment on an annual basis, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable. (o) Non-controlling interests F- 14 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Non-controlling interests (“NCI”) represents equity interests owned by outside parties. NCI may be initially measured at fair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The Company elected to measure acquired NCI at its fair value as of the acquisition date (refer to Note 2x(viii)). (p) Income taxes Income tax expense, consisting of current and deferred tax expense, is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at period-end, adjusted for amendments to tax payable with regard to previous years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related deferred income tax expense or recovery are recognized for deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realized, or the liability settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income (loss) in the period that substantive enactment occurs. A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized. To the extent that the Company does not consider it probable that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, the deferred tax asset is reduced. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. (q) Share capital Common shares Common shares are classified as equity. The proceeds from the exercise of stock options or warrants together with amounts previously recorded in reserves over the vesting periods are recorded as share capital. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. Equity units Proceeds received on the issuance of equity units comprised of common shares and warrants, such as convertible debentures and convertible preferred stock with detachable warrants, are allocated to common shares and warrants based on the relative fair value method. (r) Share based compensation The Company has a stock option plan in place. The Company measures equity settled share-based payments based on their fair value at the grant date and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In estimating fair value, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates such as the expected life of units, volatility of the Company’s future share price, risk free rates, expected forfeiture and future dividend yields at the initial grant date. Changes in assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in materially different results. Expected forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant, based on historical trends of actual option forfeitures, and subsequently adjusted if further information indicates actual forfeitures may vary from the original estimate. Any revisions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from management’s estimates, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period. Upon exercise of stock options and warrants that are classified as equity, any historical fair value in the warrants and share-based compensation reserve is allocated to additional paid in capital. Amounts recorded for expired unexercised stock options and warrants are transferred to deficit in the year of expiration. The fair value of restricted share units is based on the closing price of the Company’s stock as of the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, by amortizing the grant date fair value over the vesting period. (s) Convertible instruments F- 15 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging Activities . Companies are required to bifurcate conversion options from their host instrument and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has been determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) as follows: the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption. The Company issued convertible debentures with detachable share purchase warrants at various times to raise capital to expand its business and support general corporate needs. The convertible instruments also included embedded derivatives in the form of conversion features and put options. Management evaluated the convertible debentures to determine the proper accounting and whether the embedded derivatives required bifurcation from the host instrument and whether the conversion feature was a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). It was concluded that the embedded derivative did not require bifurcation from the host instrument and that the conversion feature was not a BCF. The Company accounted for the convertible debentures and embedded derivatives as a single unit of account and classified them entirely as non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets in accordance with Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 470-20). The Company engaged a third-party to determine the fair value of each of the instruments issued and allocated the proceeds received from the issuance and the transaction costs related to the issuance of the convertible debentures and warrants based on their relative fair values as determined at issuance. (t) Convertible preferred stock and detachable warrants The Company evaluates convertible preferred stock in accordance with Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic ASC 470-20-35-7). All of the issued series preferred stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion ratio of one preferred share for 1,000 common shares. All series of convertible preferred stock are classified as shareholders’ equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the related preferred stock is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the day of issuance of the preferred stock. Included in the issuance were detachable warrants to purchase a convertible preferred share. The detachable purchase warrants were evaluated for equity or liability classification and were determined to meet liability classification. The warrants are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the convertible preferred shares. (u) Warrant liability The Company may issue common stock warrants with debt, equity or as a standalone financing instrument that is recorded as either liabilities or equity in accordance with the respective accounting guidance. Warrants recorded as equity are recorded at their relative fair value determined at the issuance date and remeasurement is not required. Warrants recorded as liabilities are recorded at their fair value, within warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets, and remeasured on each reporting date with changes recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. (v) Embedded derivative liabilities The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if those instruments or any embedded components of those instruments qualify as derivatives that need to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging . Embedded derivatives satisfying certain criteria are recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each F- 16 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) balance sheet date with the change in the fair value recorded as income or expense. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event that requires the derivative liability to be reclassified to equity, the derivative liability is revalued to fair value at that date. (w) (Loss) earnings per share The Company presents basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic (loss) earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method, by dividing the (loss) income attributable to common and proportionate shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common and proportionate voting shares outstanding during the period. Contingently issuable shares (including shares held in escrow) are not considered outstanding common shares and consequently are not included in the (loss) earnings per share calculations. The Company has the following categories of potentially dilutive common share equivalents: RSUs, stock options, warrants, convertible preferred shares, exchangeable shares and convertible debentures. In order to determine diluted (loss) earnings per share, it is assumed that any proceeds from the exercise of dilutive instruments would be used to repurchase common shares at the average market price during the period. The Company also considers all outstanding convertible securities, such as the convertible preferred shares, convertible debentures, and outstanding exchangeable shares as if the instruments were converted to the Company’s common stock. Diluted (loss) earnings per share is determined by adjusting the (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common and proportionate voting shares outstanding, adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential common and proportionate voting shares. Proportionate voting shares are converted to their common share equivalent of one thousand common shares for every one proportionate voting share for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share. In a period of losses, all of the potentially dilutive common share equivalents are excluded in the determination of dilutive net loss per share because their effect is antidilutive. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, no potentially dilutive common share equivalents were included in the computation of diluted loss per share because their impact would have been anti-dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 27,652,010 potentially dilutive common share equivalents were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share. (x) Discontinued operations The Company deems it appropriate to classify a part of the business as discontinued operations if the related disposal group meets all of the following criteria: (i) the disposal group is a component of the Company; (ii) the component meets the held-for-sale criteria; and (iii) the disposal of the component represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. A disposal group that represents a strategic shift to the Company is reflected as discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses as income from discontinued operations. TerrAscend Canada (“TerrAscend Canada” or “TCI”) is a cannabis retailer in Ontario, Canada with a minority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (""Cookies Canada""). TerrAscend Canada was previously a Licensed Producer (as such term is defined in the Cannabis Act) of cannabis until the Company commenced an optimization of its operations in Canada, whereby the Company reduced its manufacturing footprint in order to focus on its Cookies Canada retail business, as well as monetize its intellectual property portfolio in Canada. TerrAscend ceased operations at its manufacturing facility during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. Certain assets related to TerrAscend Canada have been classified as held for sale for all periods presented. Additionally, amounts previously presented as part of continuing operations have been reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented. (y) Use of significant estimates and judgments The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. F- 17 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Management has applied significant estimates and judgements related to the following: The net realizable value of inventory represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment, including consideration of factors such as shrinkage, the aging of and future demand for inventory, expected future selling price the Company expects to realize by selling the inventory, and the contractual arrangements with customers. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based upon quantities on hand, projected volumes from demand forecasts and net realizable value. The future realization of these inventories may be affected by market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. A change to these assumptions could impact the Company’s inventory valuation and gross profit. The impact of inventory reserves is reflected in cost of sales. From time to time, the Company partakes in sales agreements with suppliers in which it also purchases inventory. As part of the five-step revenue model, the Company assesses whether instances of bulk sales made to suppliers of goods have commercial substance and should be recognized as revenue, or whether they should be assessed under ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions , which requires management judgment to determine if the transaction has commercial substance . In calculating share-based compensation expense, key estimates are used such as, the rate of forfeiture of options granted, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the Company’s stock price, and the risk-free interest rate. In calculating the fair value of warrants issued, the Company includes key estimates such as the volatility of the Company’s stock price and the risk-free interest rate. The Company uses judgment to select methods used and in performing the fair value calculations at the initial measurement at issuance, as well as for subsequent measurement on a recurring basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized is based on an assessment of the probability of the Company generating future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized. In addition, significant judgment is required in classifying transactions and assessing probable outcomes of tax positions taken, and in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties in various tax jurisdictions. Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. It is possible, however, that at some future date, an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. If the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit are less than its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. F- 18 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) The Company uses an income-based approach as necessary to assess the fair values of intangible assets and its reporting units for goodwill testing purposes. Under the income approach, fair value is based on the present value of estimated cash flows. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the most recent information available. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Determining the value in use requires the Company to estimate expected future cash flows associated with the assets and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts, and market data are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and intangible assets. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, ROU assets, and definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or an asset acquisition depends on whether the asset acquired constitutes a business, which can be a complex judgement. The Company has determined that its acquisitions in Note 4 are business combinations under ASC 805 Business Combinations . In a business combination, substantially all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. One of the most significant areas of judgment and estimation relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities, including the fair value of contingent consideration, if applicable. If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, the Company may utilize an independent external valuation expert to develop the fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, which are generally based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. These valuations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in the discount rate applied. The Company elected to measure each NCI at its fair value as of the acquisition date based on an appraisal of the real estate acquired using the market approach, specifically the direct comparison approach of comparable properties. Contingent consideration payable as the result of a business combination is recorded at the date of acquisition at fair value. The fair value of contingent consideration is subject to significant judgement and estimates, such as projected future revenue. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are measured at each reporting date, with changes recognized through profit or loss. Lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available. If that rate cannot be easily determined, the lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company estimates it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The Company calculates its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate the Company would pay to borrow funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value over similar terms taking into consideration the economic factors and the credit risk rating at the commencement date of the lease. F- 19 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) In addition, the Company utilizes a discount rate to determine the appropriate fair value of convertible debentures and loans issued with warrants attached. The discount rate applied reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount at a similar term and with a similar security. When determining the appropriate basis of accounting for the Company’s interests in affiliates, the Company makes judgments about the degree of influence that it exerts directly or through an arrangement over the investees’ relevant activities. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Securities Act (""CARES Act"") provides for an employee retention credit (""ERC"") which is a refundable tax credit for businesses that continued to pay employees while shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or had significant declines in gross receipts from March 13, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Eligible employers can claim the ERC on an original or adjusted employment tax return for a period within those dates. The Company has elected to account for the credit as a government grant. There is limited grant accounting guidance within U.S. GAAP that is applicable to for-profit entities, therefore, the Company has elected to follow the grant accounting model in International Accounting Standard (""IAS"") 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Accordingly, the Company recognizes government grants for which there is a reasonable assurance of compliance with grant conditions and receipt of credits and has therefore recognized a receivable for the total credit amount on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 (refer to Note 3). The determination of the collectability of the ERC requires significant judgement, including assessment of the Company's eligibility based on the facts and circumstances. While the Company believes that collection of the ERC is probable, there is some uncertainty around collection due to the nature of the Company's industry.

The consideration paid reflected the synergies, economies of scale, and workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Costs related to this transaction were $ 117 , including legal, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses, and were included in transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). On a standalone basis, had the Company acquired the business on January 1, 2022, sales estimates would have been $ 19,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net loss estimates would have been $ 6,549 . Actual sales and net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 since the date of acquisition are $ 9,024 and $ 983 , respectively. Gage On March 10, 2022, in order to expand its footprint in key markets, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares (or equivalent) of Gage, a cultivator, processor, and retailer with operations in the Michigan market. Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement agreement, for each Gage subordinate voting shares and other equity instruments, including outstanding stock options and warrants, each holder received a 0.3001 equivalent replacement award of the Company's respective security at the time of closing based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the CSE on March 10, 2022.

Of these Common Shares and Exchangeable Share Units, 10,467,229 Common Shares were subject to a 6 month legal restriction in which the restriction is a characteristic of the security, and therefore considered in the fair value of share consideration. As such, a restriction discount has been placed over the shares subject to lock-up of $ 10,323 . The fair value of the replacement options and warrants was calculated using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model (""Black- Scholes model"") combined with the percentage of the vesting period that was completed prior to the acquisition.

KCR holds a permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Health which grants the right to operate three dispensaries in the state of Pennsylvania. The Company’s investment represented a 10 % equity share in KCR. The Company had significant influence over KCR as the Company’s Ilera business supplies a significant portion of inventory, and therefore, the investment in KCR was accounted for using the equity method and was included in investment in associate on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquisition was adjusted for earnings and cash distributions. On April 30, 2021, the investment had a carrying value of $ 1,223 . The fair value of the investment on April 30, 2021 was estimated to be $ 7,101 , which was implied based on the overall purchase price. An unrealized gain of $ 5,878 was recorded and included in the unrealized and realized gain on investments and notes receivable in the statement of operations.

F- 28 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Contingent consideration Contingent consideration recorded relates to the Company’s business acquisitions. Contingent consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the terms of the agreement.

See – Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its property and equipment. The impairment losses discussed below were included in (loss) income from discontinued operations on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain assets of TerrAscend Canada were determined to be held for sale as of December 31, 2022 as they met the criteria under ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment . TerrAscend Canada operated out of a 67,300 square foot facility located in Mississauga , Ontario. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. The Company determined the fair market value of the building based on the listing price and related commission and determined that the fair value was lower than its carrying value and therefore recorded impairment of $ 6,998 . The fair value less cost to sell was included in assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company recorded impairment of $ 1,105 related to machinery and equipment at TerrAscend Canada that could not be transferred or sold. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company determined that equipment purchased for the purpose of extracting CBD and THC oils to support the medical cannabis business in Canada needed to be assessed for impairment as the equipment was never put into use and the Company has since exited the medical cannabis business in Canada. The Company evaluated the recoverability of the asset to determine whether it would be recoverable, and it was determined that the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows and therefore, recorded an impairment loss of $ 470 . The Company determined that the assets meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and the remaining net book value of $ 343 was included in other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. F- 31 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made a strategic decision to cease the growing and cultivation of cannabis in Canada.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined that changes in market expectations of cash flows in its Michigan, Pennsylvania and California businesses, as well as increased competition and supply in the states, were indicators that an impairment test was appropriate for each of these reporting units. Long-lived assets The impairment test for long-lived assets is a two-step test, whereby management first determines the recoverable amount by calculating the undiscounted cash flows of each asset group. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the asset group, then impairment is indicated. For the Michigan reporting unit, the Company determined the fair value of the asset groups and allocates the impairment to the assets, being the (i) cultivation and processing licenses, and (ii) retail licenses, acquired through the Gage Acquisition. The Company compared the carrying value of the assets to its fair value and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for both the retail and the cultivation and processing licenses. As such, the Company recorded impairment charges of $ 79,462 and $ 42,065 for the cultivation and processing licenses and retail licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to $ nil . The fair value of each asset group was determined using cash flows expected to be generated by market participants, discounted at weighted average cost of capital. The fair value of the specific assets that were impaired was determined using the multi period excess earnings method based on the following key assumptions: During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment of $ 343 related to its customer relationships at Arise as a result of its termination of an agreement with one of its wholesale distributors. Indefinite lived assets Indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whether there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. The impairment indicators previously noted for Michigan indicate that the fair value of the Gage brand intangible assets are more likely than not lower than the carrying value. As such, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined the fair value of its brand intangible assets using the relief of royalty method. As a result of the quantitative analysis performed, the Company recognized impairment of $ 19,200 , reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to $ 57,985 . During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made the decision to undertake a strategic review process to explore, review, and evaluate potential alternatives for its Arise business. The Company also determined that the estimated future cash flows for the business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets, and therefore recorded impairment of intangible assets of $ 3,633 for the year ended December 31, 2021, reducing the carrying value to $nil. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value has been impaired. F- 34 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) During the year ended December 31, 2022, based on the indicators of impairment noted previously, the Company determined that there were indicators that the fair value of its reporting units are more likely than not lower than its carrying value at some of its reporting units. As such, a quantitative impairment test was performed over its Michigan reporting unit, which includes goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition, its Pennsylvania reporting unit, and its California reporting unit. The following significant assumptions were applied in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model: During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairment of goodwill of $ 170,357 at its Michigan reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and Pinnacle Acquisition to $nil. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over the Company's Pennsylvania reporting unit, the Company determined that the fair value of the Pennsylvania reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Pennsylvania reporting unit was $ 76,761 at December 31, 2022. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over the Company's California wholesale reporting unit, the Company determined that the fair value of the California wholesale reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the California wholesale reporting unit was $ 4,689 at December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a qualitative analysis over its Maryland reporting unit and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was performed. There is no goodwill at the Company's Canada, New Jersey, California retail and Florida reporting units. As a result of the Company’s decision to undertake a strategic review of its Florida business, Company recorded impairment of goodwill of $ 5,007 during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill for each of its reporting units. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California wholesale and Maryland reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was performed. The Company performed a quantitative analysis over its Pennsylvania reporting unit using the significant assumptions discussed previously to determine the fair value, and determined that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Pennsylvania reporting unit was $ 76,761 at December 31, 2021. There is no goodwill at the Company’s Canada, California retail and New Jersey reporting units. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill for each of its reporting units. It was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California wholesale and Pennsylvania reporting units exceed their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was performed. The Company performed a quantitative analysis over its Florida reporting unit and determined that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Florida reporting unit was $ 5,007 at December 31, 2020.

Canopy USA loans Canopy Growth (formerly RIV Capital loan) On February 5, 2020, the Company and RIV Capital Inc. (“RIV Capital”), formerly Canopy Rivers Inc., agreed to amend the terms of their previously issued convertible debentures with a face value of $ 10,000 . Pursuant to the amended terms, the first tranche of the convertible debentures was converted into a $ 10,000 loan payable bearing interest at a rate of 6 % per annum, payable annually, with a balance due date of October 2, 2024. The effective interest rate on the loan is 15.99 %. The Company also issued RIV Capital 2,225,714 common share purchase warrants (Note 11), exercisable at $ 4.48 (C$ 5.95 ) upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The warrants were issued such that they can be exercised upon maturity of the loan payable in a cashless exercise by offsetting the principal value of the loan payable. The amendment was treated as a modification of the convertible debenture and as a result, no gains or losses were recorded for the transaction. The fair value of the debt was calculated using the effective interest rate method and allocated the proceeds of the issuance to the debenture and the warrants based on their relative fair values as determined at issuance. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Canopy Growth acquired the common share purchase warrants previously issued to RIV Capital as well as the loan payable outstanding balance. On December 9, 2022, the Company entered into a debt settlement agreement (the ""Canopy Debt Settlement Agreement"") with Canopy USA, LLC, Canopy USA I Limited Partnership and Canopy USA III Limited Partnership (collectively, the ""Canopy USA Entities""), pursuant to which agreement certain obligations under all of the outstanding loans, plus accrued interest, with the Canopy USA Entities were extinguished in exchange for 24,601,467 exchangeable shares of the Company (""Exchangeable Shares"") at a notional price of $ 3.74 (C$ 5.10 ) per Exchangeable Share. Additionally, in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging , the 22,474,130 original warrants to acquire common shares of the Company (the ""Common Shares"") were modified (the ""Modified Canopy Warrants"") at a weighted average exercise price of $ 4.45 . The Exchangeable Shares and Modified Canopy Warrants were considered in the calculation for extinguishment of the debt obligations, including all principal and interest on the amounts outstanding thereunder (refer to Note 11 for further details regarding the Modified Canopy Warrants and Exchangeable Shares). As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $ 773 related to this loan. Canopy 2020 Debenture F- 36 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) On March 10, 2020, TerrAscend Canada Inc. entered into a secured debenture with Canopy USA III Limited Partnership, as successor to Canopy Growth Corporation, whereby it promised to pay to Canopy USA III Limited Partnership in the amount of $ 58,645 (""Canopy 2020 Debenture"").

The fair value of the debt was calculated using the effective interest rate method and allocated the proceeds of the issuance to the debenture and the warrants based on their relative fair values as determined at issuance. As stated above, on December 9, 2022, the Company entered into an arrangement with the Canopy USA Entities in which the outstanding loan balance of the Canopy Arise Debenture was converted into Exchangeable Shares and Modified Canopy Warrants. As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 807 . Other Loans Paycheck Protection Program loan On March 13, 2021, the Company’s Arise business was granted a loan from Bank of America in the aggregate amount of $ 766 , pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”), bearing interest at 1.00 % per annum. The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) provides for loans to qualifying businesses with the proceeds to be used for payroll costs, rent, utilities, and interest on other debt obligations. The loans and accrued interest F- 37 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) are forgivable after eight weeks as long as the funds are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the principal and interest on the PPP loan was partially forgiven in the amount of $ 648 . The remaining amount was repaid on December 17, 2021, reducing the total outstanding amount to $nil at December 31, 2021 .

The Company made payments of principal and interest of $ 2,351 , reducing the balance to $nil at December 31, 2022. Ilera Term Loan On December 18, 2020, WDB Holding PA, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a senior secured term loan with a syndicate of lenders in the amount of $ 120,000 (""Ilera Term Loan""). The term loan bears interest at 12.875 % per annum and matures on December 17, 2024 . The Company has the ability to increase the facility by up to $ 30,000 . WDB Holding PA's obligation under the Ilera Term Loan and related transaction documents are guaranteed by the Company, TerrAscend USA, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of WDB Holding PA, and secured by TerrAscend USA Inc.'s equity interest in WDB Holding PA and substantially all of the assets of WDB Holding PA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto. The loan can be refinanced at the option of the borrower after 18 months from the closing date subject to a premium payment due. Of the total proceeds received, $ 105,767 was used to satisfy the remaining Ilera earn-out payments. On April 28, 2022, the Ilera Term Loan was amended to provide WDB Holding PA with greater flexibility by resetting the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio levels that must be satisfied at the end of each measurement period and extending the date in which WDB Holding PA is required to deliver its budget for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. In addition, the no-call period was extended from 18 months to 30 months, subject to a premium payment. This amendment was not considered extinguishments of debt under ASC 470 Debt . As a result of the amendment, the Company paid a loan amendment fee of $ 1,200 which was capitalized. On November 11, 2022, WDB Holding PA, the Company, TerrAscend USA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors party to the Ilera Term Loan and the PA Agent (on behalf of the required lenders) entered into an amendment to the PA Credit Agreement, pursuant to which PA Agent and the required lenders agreed that WDB Holding PA's obligation to maintain the consolidated interest coverage ratio as set forth in the PA Credit Agreement for the period ended September 30, 2022, shall not apply, subject to certain conditions, including (but not limited to) an obligation to enter into a subsequent amendment agreement on or before December 15, 2022, documenting certain enhancements and amendments to the PA Credit Agreement to be agreed. In addition, WDB Holding PA offered a prepayment of $ 5,000 pro rata to all lenders holding outstanding loans thereunder at a price equal to 103.22 % of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On December 21, 2022, WDB Holding PA completed an amendment to reduce the Company's principal debt by $ 35,000 and annual interest expense by $ 5,000 . The Company agreed to make a $ 35,000 payment at the original prepayment price of 103.22 % to par, and agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to add certain collateral to Ilera Term Loan, collectively by March 15, 2023. The amendment further provided that should WDB Holding PA not maintain the prescribed interest coverage ratio, the Company shall be required to deposit funds, as outlined in the amendment, into a restricted account, and no event of default shall occur. This amendment was not considered extinguishments of debt under ASC 470 Debt . KCR Loan The acquisition of KCR included a $ 6,750 note payable which bears interest at 10.00 % per annum and matures on April 30, 2022 . The note was recorded at its fair value at inception and subsequently carried at amortized cost. The Company made principal payments on this loan of $ 4,500 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The remaining principal and interest of $ 2,234 were fully paid during the year ended December 31, 2022. Gage Loans The Gage Acquisition (refer to Note 4) included a senior secured term loan (the ""Original Gage Term Loan"") with an acquisition date fair value of $ 53,857 . The credit agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate plus 7 % or (ii) F- 38 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) 10.25 %. The term loan is payable monthly and matures on November 30, 2022 . The term loan is secured by a first lien on all Gage assets. On August 10, 2022, the Original Gage Term Loan was amended as a result of the corporate restructure in conjunction with the Gage Acquisition. The amendment to the Original Gage Term Loan includes the addition of a borrower and guarantor under the term loan and a right of first offer in favor of the administrative agent for a refinancing of the term loan. This amendment was not considered extinguishments of debt under ASC 470 Debt . As a result of the amendment, the Company paid a loan amendment fee of $ 1,109 which was capitalized. On November 29, 2022, the Company repaid $ 30,000 outstanding principal amount on the Original Gage Term Loan. On November 30, 2022, the remaining loan principal amount of $ 25,000 on the Original Gage Term Loan was amended (the ""Amended Gage Term Loan""). The Amended Gage Term Loan bears interest on $ 25,000 at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the U.S. ""prime rate"" plus 6.00 %, and (ii) 13.0 % and matures on November 1, 2024 . Commencing on May 31, 2023, the Company will make monthly principal repayments of 0.40 % of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Additionally, the unpaid principal amount of the loan shall bear paid in kind interest at a rate of 1.50 % per annum. No prepayment fees are owed if the Company voluntarily prepays the loan after 18 months . If such prepayment occurs prior to 18 months , a prepayment fee equal to all of the interest on the loans that would be due after the date of such prepayment, is owed. Under th e Amended Gage Term Loan, the Company has the ability to borrow incremental term loans of $ 30,000 at the option of the Company and subject to consents from the required lenders. The additional $ 30,000 incremental term loans available under the amendment have not been drawn as of December 31, 2022. This loan represents a loan syndication, and therefore the Company assessed each of the lenders separately under ASC 470 Debt to determine if this represents a modification, or an extinguishment of debt. For three of the four remaining lenders, it was determined that this was a modification. For the remaining lender, it was determined that this represented an extinguishment of debt and therefore the fees paid to the lenders on modification were expensed. As a result of this transaction, the Company expensed $ 1,907 of fees paid to the lenders and third parties as they did not meet the criteria for capitalization under ASC 470 Debt . Additionally, the Gage Acquisition included a loan payable to a former owner of a licensed entity with an acquisition date fair value of $ 2,683 , and a promissory note with an acquisition date fair value of $ 4,065 . The loan payable to the former owner bears interest at a rate of 0.2 %. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 6 %. Pinnacle Loans The Pinnacle Acquisition purchase price included two promissory notes in an aggregate amount of $ 10,000 to pay down all Pinnacle liabilities and encumbrances. The promissory notes mature on June 30, 2023 and bear interest rates of 6 %. Pelorus Term Loan On October 11, 2022, subsidiaries of the Company, among others, entered into a loan agreement with Pelorus Fund REIT, LLC (""Pelorus"") for a single-draw senior secured term loan (""Pelorus Term Loan"") in an aggregate principal amount of $ 45,478 . The Pelorus Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate tied to the one month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), subject to a base rate, plus 9.5 %, with interest-only payments for the first 36 months. The base rate is defined as, on any day, the greatest of (i) 2.5 %, (b) the effective federal funds rate in effect on such day plus 0.5 %, and (c) one month SOFR in effect on such day. The obligations of the borrowers under the Pelorus Term Loan are guaranteed by the Company, TerrAscend USA Inc. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company's Maryland and New Jersey businesses, including certain real estate in Maryland and New Jersey. The Pelorus Term Loan matures on October 11, 2027.

The lease termination fee was paid to the landlord on January 27, 2022.

The seller then becomes the lessee and the buyer becomes to the lessor. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 842, both parties must assess whether the buyer-lessor has obtained control of the asset and a sale has occurred. Through the Gage Acquisition (refer to Note 4), the Company entered into leaseback transactions on six properties of owned real estate. The Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify as a sale because control was not transferred to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company has classified the lease portion of the transaction as a finance lease and continues to depreciate the asset. The balance at December 31, 20 22 was $ 12,002 . Of this amount, $ 804 is included in other current liabilities and $ 11,198 is included in financing obligations in the Consolidate Balance Sheets. The financing obligations had a weighted average term and weighted average discount rate of 7.7 years and 9.53 %, respectively, at December 31, 2022.

Shareholders’ equity The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares, proportionate voting shares, exchangeable shares, and preferred shares. The Company’s board of directors have the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges, and liquidation preferences, of each class of the Company’s capital stock. Unlimited Number of Preferred Shares The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to issue an unlimited number of preferred shares in Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D convertible preferred shares (the “Convertible Preferred Shares”). The preferred shares of each series will, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, rank on parity with the preferred shares of every other series and be entitled to preference over the Proportionate Voting Shares, Common Shares and Exchange Shares. Voting Rights Holders of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive notice of, or to attend or to vote at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company. Dividends The holders of the Convertible Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive any dividends, except that if the Company issues a dividend when necessary to comply with contractual provisions in respect of an adjustment to the conversion ratio in connection with any dividend paid on the Common Shares. F- 42 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Conversion Rights Holders of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Shares are entitled to convert each outstanding share to 1,000 common shares of the Company (or the economic equivalent in proportionate voting shares for U.S. investors) at the option of the holder, subject to customary anti-dilution provisions. The Convertible Preferred Shares will be automatically converted into proportionate voting shares at the then-effective conversion ratio, instead of being redeemed for cash and other assets, in the event of a change in control. Redemption Rights The Company classified the Convertible Preferred Shares as permanent equity in the financial statements given that the terms do not obligate the Company to buy back the shares of preferred stock in exchange for cash or other assets, nor do the shares represent an obligation that must or may be settled with a variable number of shares, which are debt-like features. No other redemption provisions exist within the terms of the instrument. Liquidation Preference In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or upon any other return of capital or distribution of the assets of the Company among its shareholders, in each case for the purposes of winding up its affairs, each Convertible Preferred Share entitles the holder thereof to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution, before any distribution or payment may be made to a holder of any Common Shares, Proportionate Voting Shares, Exchangeable Shares or any other shares ranking junior in such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up to the Convertible Preferred Shares, an amount per Convertible Preferred Share equal to the fair market value of the consideration paid for such preferred share upon issuance. The Company’s Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D convertible preferred shares have a liquidation preference that is initially equal to $ 2,000 , $ 2,000 , $ 3,000 and $ 3,000 , respectively, per share; provided that if the Company makes a distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the respective series of Convertible Preferred Shares, or if the Company effects a share split or share consolidation of the respective series of Convertible Preferred Shares, then the liquidation preference will then be adjusted on the effective date of such event by a rate computed as (i) the number of respective series of Convertible Preferred Shares outstanding immediately before giving effect to such event divided by (ii) the number of respective series of Convertible Preferred Shares outstanding immediately after such event. After payment to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Shares of the full liquidation preference to which they are entitled in respect of outstanding Convertible Preferred Shares (which, for greater certainty), have not been converted prior to such payment), such Convertible Preferred Shares will have no further right or claim to any of the assets of the Company. The liquidation preference will be payable to holders of Convertible Preferred Shares in cash; provided, however, that to the extent the Company has, having exercised commercially reasonable efforts to make such payment, insufficient cash available to pay the liquidation preference in full in cash, the portion of the Liquidation Preference with respect to which the Company has insufficient cash may be paid in property or other assets of the Company. The value of any property or assets not consisting of cash that is distributed by the Company in satisfaction of any portion of the liquidation preference will equal the fair market value on the date of distribution. As of December 31, 2022, the Convertible Preferred Series A and B Shares have an aggregate liquidation value of $ 26,416 , or $ 2,000 per share. Unlimited Number of Proportionate Voting Shares Holders of Proportionate Voting Shares are entitled to receive, as and when declared by the Board, dividends in cash or property of the Company. No dividend may be declared on the Proportionate Voting Shares unless the Company simultaneously declares dividends on the Common Shares in an amount equal to the dividend declared per Proportionate Voting Shares divided by 1,000. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or in the event of any other distribution of assets of the Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, the holders of Proportionate Voting Shares are entitled to participate pari passu with the holders of Common Shares in an amount equal to the amount of such distribution per Common Share multiplied by 1,000. F- 43 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Holders of Proportionate Voting Shares are not entitled to a right of first refusal to subscribe for, purchase or receive any part of any issue of shares, or bonds, debentures or other securities of the Company. There may be no subdivision or consolidation of the Proportionate Voting Shares unless, simultaneously, the Common Shares and Exchangeable Shares are subdivided or consolidated using the same divisor or multiplier. Proportionate Voting Shares carry 1,000 votes per share , are entitled to participate in dividends and in the distribution of proceeds on a wind-up of the Company on a $ 1,000 -to-$1.00 basis relative to the Common Shares. Each Proportionate Voting Share is exchangeable into 1,000 Common Shares. Unlimited Number of Exchangeable Shares Voting Rights The holders of Exchangeable Shares will not be entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at meetings of the shareholders of the Company; provided that the holders of Exchangeable Shares will, however, be entitled to receive notice of meetings of shareholders called for the purpose of authorizing the dissolution of the Company or the sale of its assets, or a substantial part thereof, but holders of Exchangeable Shares will not be entitled to vote at such meeting of the shareholders of the Company. Dividends The holders of the Exchanges Shares will not be entitled to receive any dividends. Dissolution In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of assets of the Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up its affairs, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will not be entitled to receive any amount, property or assets of the Company. Exchange Rights Each issued and outstanding Exchangeable Share may at any time following the exchange start date applicable to the holder of such Exchangeable Share, at the option of the holder, be exchanged for on Common Share. Unlimited Number of Common Shares Voting Rights Holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive notice of, and to attend, all meetings of the shareholders of the Company and shall have one vote per each Common Share held at all meetings of the Company, except for meetings at which only holders of another specified class or series of shares of the Company are entitled to vote separately as a class or series. Dividend Rights The holders of the Common Shares are entitled to receive, subject to the rights of the holder of any other class of shares, any dividends declared by the Company. If, as and when dividends are declared by the directors, each Common Share will be entitled to 0.001 times the amount paid or distributed per Proportionate Voting Share (or, if a stock dividend is declared, each Common Share will be entitled to receive the same number of Common Shares per Common Share of Proportionate Voting Shares entitled to be received per Proportionate Voting Share). Dissolution In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of assets of the Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up its affairs, the holders of the Common Shares will, subject to the rights of any other class of shares, be entitled to receive the remaining property of the Company on the basis that each Common Share will be entitled to 0.001 times the amount distributed per Proportionate Voting Share, but otherwise there is no preference or distinction among or between the Proportionate Voting Shares and the Common Shares. F- 44 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Conversion Rights Each issued and outstanding Common Share may at any time, at the option of the holder, be converted into 0.001 of a Proportionate Voting Share.

Common shares issued for compensation On March 25, 2020, the Company issued 1,625,701 common shares to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of NJ, pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses in the state of New Jersey to NJ. Stock Options The Company’s Board of Directors approved the Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”) effective March 8, 2017. The Plan provides for the granting of stock options to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company. Stock options are granted for a term not to exceed ten years at an exercise price, which is the greater of the closing market price of the shares on the CSE on the trading day immediately preceding the date the options are granted and on the same day of the option grant. The options are not transferrable. The Plan is administered by the Board of Directors, which determines individual eligibility under the Plan, number of shares reserved for optioning to each individual (not to exceed 5 % of issued and outstanding shares to any one individual) and the vesting period. The maximum number of shares of the Company that are issuable pursuant to the Plan is limited to 10 % of the fully diluted shares of the Company at the date of the grant of options. The stock options outstanding noted below consist of service-based options granted to employees to purchase common stock, the majority of which vest over a one to three-year period and have a five to ten-year contractual term. These awards are subject to the risk of forfeiture until vested by virtue of continued employment or service to the Company.

The total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the market price of the Company’s common stock on the exercise date and the price paid by the options to exercise the option) related to stock options exercised is presented below: For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Exercised $ 1,355 $ 6,667 $ 10,123 The Gage Acquisition included consideration in the form of 4,940,364 replacement options that had been issued on the acquisition date to employees of Gage. The post-combination options vest over a 1- 3 year period. The fair value of the replacement options are estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: March 10, 2022 Volatility 55.0 %- 80.0 % Risk-free interest rate 1.22 %- 1.94 % Expected life (years) 1.00 - 5.00 Dividend yield 0 % F- 49 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) The fair value of the various stock options granted were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Volatility 77.55 % - 77.89 % 79.05 % - 81.51 % 82.29 % - 87.09 % Risk-free interest rate 1.63 % - 3.51 % 0.90 % - 1.72 % 0.35 % - 1.60 % Expected life (years) 9.62 - 10.01 4.57 - 10.05 4.76 - 4.95 Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % Forfeiture rate 26.11 % 23.21 %- 27.73 % 23.21 % Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. treasury bond issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was $ 8,352 , $ 14,840 , and $ 9,035 , respectively. Restricted Share Units Effective November 19, 2019, the Company adopted the Share Unit Plan, which allows for the granting of performance share units (PSUs) and restricted share units (RSUs) to directors, officers, employees, and consultants of the Company and provides them the opportunity to defer certain compensation and equity awards paid or grated for their service in the form of stock units (“Stock Units”). The Stock Units are used solely as a device for determining the amount of cash benefit to eventually be paid to the grantee. Each Stock Unit has the same value as one share of the Company’s common stock. The PSUs generally become vested upon attainment of established performance conditions, as well as service conditions. The RSUs generally become vested upon completion of continuous employment over the requisite service period. The following table summarizes the activities for the RSUs: Number of RSUs Number of RSUs vested Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) Outstanding, December 31, 2019 — — N/A Granted 280,099 Vested ( 157,788 ) Outstanding, December 31, 2020 122,311 33,733 N/A Granted 174,408 Vested ( 40,665 ) Forfeited ( 63,883 ) Outstanding, December 31, 2021 192,171 13,294 N/A Granted 1,176,397 Vested ( 669,478 ) Forfeited ( 283,450 ) Outstanding, December 31, 2022 415,640 13,050 N/A Of the RSU's granted during the year ended December 31, 2022, 106,840 vested on the grant date and the rest will vest over a 6 - month to 4-year term.

F- 52 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) The following table presents a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ 9,318 $ 12,008 Increases based on tax positions related to prior periods 2,872 4,884 Increase (decrease) based on tax positions related to prior periods 8,655 ( 4,546 ) Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 1,962 ) ( 3,028 ) Balance at end of year $ 18,883 $ 9,318 Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as components of the provision for income taxes. The Company had $ 2,170 and $ 1,071 of interest accrued at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company's unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of accruals for income tax related penalties and interest, include $ 13,223 and $ 9,318 of tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The unrecognized tax benefits are included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Also included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are $ 6,758 and $ nil , respectively, of tax benefits, that if recognized would result in adjustments to other tax accounts, primarily deferred taxes. The principal component of deferred taxes are as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Deferred tax assets Net operating losses $ 42,022 $ 26,321 Reserves 2,837 — Share issuance costs — 700 Property and equipment 4,689 2,038 Intangible assets 3,768 4,101 Other 8,700 1,696 Total deferred tax assets 62,016 34,856 Valuation allowance ( 61,274 ) ( 24,097 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 742 $ 10,759 Deferred tax liabilities Convertible debentures $ - $ ( 10,065 ) Intangible assets ( 31,442 ) ( 14,963 ) Other — — Total deferred tax liabilities $ ( 31,442 ) $ ( 25,028 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 30,700 ) $ ( 14,269 ) The Company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate if it is more likely than not to use certain jurisdiction-based deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryovers. On the basis of this assessment, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $ 125,953 of Canadian net operating loss carryovers that expire at different times, the earliest of which is 2034 for $ 547 . As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $ 18,295 of domestic federal net operating loss carryovers with no expiration date. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has various state net operating loss carryovers that expire at different times. The statute of limitations with respect to our federal returns remains open for tax years 2019 and forward. Certain acquired subsidiaries were under IRS audit for tax years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2015. This audit was closed during the tax year ended December 31, 2022 and the indemnification asset of $ 3,973 was released during the year. Over the next twelve months, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that various statutes of limitation will expire which would have the effect of reducing the balance of unrecognized tax benefits by $ 2,100 . As the Company operates in the cannabis industry, it is subject to the limitations of IRC Section 280E, under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. This results in permanent differences between F- 53 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-deductible under IRC Section 280E. Therefore, the effective tax rate can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income or loss. 16. General and administrative expenses The Company’s general and administrative expenses were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Office and general $ 26,000 $ 10,091 $ 10,810 Professional fees 12,942 12,041 13,613 Lease expense 5,302 4,523 3,721 Facility and maintenance 4,050 1,396 2,079 Salaries and wages 44,814 30,256 18,792 Share-based compensation 12,162 14,942 10,075 Sales and marketing 10,318 1,858 1,673 Total $ 115,588 $ 75,107 $ 60,763 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company expensed $ 7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses, which is included in professional fees in the table above. The first payment of $ 3,750 was due upon NJ being granted an alternative treatment center license in the state of New Jersey. On March 25, 2020, the first payment was settled in shares at a fair value determined on the date NJ received the license and issued 1,625,701 common shares. The second payment of $ 3,750 is due on the earlier of (i) March 31, 2023, and (ii) fifteen days after TerrAscend NJ shall have made distributions to one or more of its members totaling at least $ 15,000 in aggregate. 17 . Revenue, net The Company’s disaggregated revenue by source, primarily due to the Company’s contracts with its external customers were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Wholesale $ 63,810 $ 107,091 $ 87,443 Retail 184,019 87,119 44,709 Total $ 247,829 $ 194,210 $ 132,152 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 , the Company did no t have any single customer that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenue. As a result of the vape recall in Pennsylvania (refer to Note 5), the Company recorded sales returns of $ 1,040 during the year ended December 31, 2022. 18. Finance and other expense Finance and other expenses were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Interest and accretion $ 39,059 $ 24,989 $ 7,034 Indemnification asset release 3,973 4,504 — Forgiveness of principal and interest on loans — ( 1,414 ) — Employee retention credits ( 9,440 ) — — Debt modification fees 2,507 — — Other (income) expense ( 206 ) ( 230 ) 393 Total $ 35,893 $ 27,849 $ 7,427 F- 54 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) The indemnification asset release is the reduction of the indemnification asset related to the expiration of the escrow agreement related to the acquisition of The Apothecarium. The debt modification fees relate to amounts paid to modify the Gage Amended Term Loan which did not meet the criteria to capitalize under ASC 470 Debt . 19. Segment information Operating Segment The Company determines its operating segments according to how the business activities are managed and evaluated by the Company’s chief operating decision maker. The Company operates under one operating segment, which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. Geography The Company has subsidiaries located in Canada and the United States. The Company had the following net revenue by geography of: For the years ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 United States $ 247,829 $ 194,210 $ 132,152 Canada — — — Total $ 247,829 $ 194,210 $ 132,152 The Company had non-current assets by geography of: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 United States $ 577,750 $ 409,150 Canada 1,844 296 Total $ 579,594 $ 409,446 20. Capital management The Company’s objective in managing capital is to ensure a sufficient liquidity position to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order to achieve this objective, the Company prepares a capital budget to manage its capital structure. The Company defines capital as borrowings, equity comprised of issued share capital, share-based payments, accumulated deficit, as well as funds borrowed from related parties. Since inception, the Company has primarily financed its liquidity needs through the issuance of share capital and debt. The equity issuances are outlined in Note 11 and debt issuances are outlined in Note 9. The Company is subject to financial covenants as a result of its loans payable with various lenders. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2022. In the event that, in future periods, the Company’s financial results are below levels required to maintain compliance with any of its covenants, the Company will assess and undertake appropriate corrective initiatives with a view to allowing it to continue to comply with its covenants. Other than these items related to loans payable, the Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 21. Financial instruments and risk management Assets and liabilities measured at fair value Financial instruments recorded at fair value are estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is summarized as follows: F- 55 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Level 1- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities Level 2- inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) from observable market data Level 3- inputs for assets and liabilities not based upon observable market data Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. The following table summarizes the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value: At December 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 26,158 $ - — $ - $ 79,642 $ - — $ - Restricted cash 605 — — — — — Purchase option derivative asset — — 50 — — 868 Total Assets $ 26,763 $ - $ 50 $ 79,642 $ - $ 868 Liabilities Contingent consideration payable $ - $ - $ 5,184 $ - $ - $ 12,535 Warrant liability — 711 — — 54,986 — Total Liabilities $ - $ 711 $ 5,184 $ - $ 54,986 $ 12,535 There were no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. The valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are presented below. Level 1 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted stock represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. Level 2 Warrant liability The following table summarizes the changes in the warrant liability: Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 132,257 Included in loss on fair value of warrants ( 58,158 ) Exercises ( 19,113 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 54,986 Addition on acquisition 6,756 Included in gain on fair value of warrants ( 59,341 ) Exercises ( 1,690 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 711 The Company's warrant liability consists of its Series A, B, C, and D convertible preferred stock issued through its 2020 private placements (""private placement warrant liability""), as well as the warrant liability acquired through its Gage Acquisition (""Gage warrant liability"") (refer to Note 4). The warrant liability is remeasured each period using the Black Scholes model. The Company recognized a gain on fair value of warrants of $ 59,341 and $ 58,158 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively, and a loss of $ 110,518 for the year ended December 31, 2020. F- 56 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) The private placement warrant liability has been remeasured to fair value. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes model were as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 1.13 $ 6.11 Warrant exercise price $ 3,000 $ 3,000 Warrant conversion ratio $ 1,000 $ 1,000 Annual volatility 105.3 % 65.5 % Annual risk-free rate 4.6 % 0.6 % Expected term (in years) 0.4 1.4 The Gage warrant liability has been remeasured to fair value. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes model were as follows: December 31, 2022 March 10, 2022 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 1.13 $ 4.92 Warrant exercise price $ 8.66 $ 8.66 Annual volatility 97.1 %- 98.4 % 65.0 % Annual risk-free rate 4.8 % 1.7 % Expected term (in years) 1.0 2.0 Level 3 Purchase option derivative asset The following table summarizes the changes in the purchase option derivative asset: Balance at December 31, 2020 $ - Initial measurement of purchase option derivative asset 1,122 Revaluation of purchase option derivative asset ( 254 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 868 Revaluation of purchase option derivative asset ( 818 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 50 The purchase option derivative asset has been measured at fair value at the transaction date using the Monte Carlo simulation model that relies on assumptions around the Company’s EBITDA volatility and risk adjusted discount, among others. The Company recognized a loss on fair value of purchase option derivative asset of $ 818 and $ 254 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model are summarized below: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Term (in years) 0.5 1.3 Risk-free rate 2.5 % 0.4 % EBITDA discount rate 15.5 % 15.0 % EBITDA volatility 37.1 % 44.0 % Key inputs and assumptions used on the initial measurement date are summarized below: August 20, 2021 Term (in years) 1.7 Risk-free rate 0.3 % EBITDA discount rate 15.0 % EBITDA volatility 60.0 % F- 57 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Contingent Consideration Payable The fair value of contingent consideration was determined using a probability weighted model based on the likelihood of achieving certain revenue and EBITDA scenario outcomes. The contingent consideration for State Flower was calculated based on fiscal year 2021 revenue and the final earnout has been calculated as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the KCR was reduced to $nil, as it was determined it was more likely than not that the earnout criteria would not be met. The combined revaluations resulted in a gain on revaluation of contingent consideration of $ 1,061 for the year ended December 31, 2022. A discount rate of 12.2 % and 12.3 to 12.9 % for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, was utilized to determine the present value of the liabilities. As a result of the revaluation, the Company recognized a loss on revaluation of contingent consideration of $ 3,584 and $ 18,709 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Risk Management The Company’s risk exposure and the impact on the Company’s financial instruments are summarized below: (a) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and notes receivable. The Company assesses the credit risk of trade receivables by evaluating the aging of trade receivables based on the invoice date. The carrying amounts of trade receivables are reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When a trade receivable balance is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for expected credit losses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company regularly monitors credit risk exposure and takes steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in actual loss. The Company has no customers whose balance is greater than 10% of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022. (b) Liquidity risk The Company is exposed to liquidity risk, or the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages liquidity risk through ongoing review of its capital requirements. The Company’s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations. (c) Market Risk The significant market risk exposures to which the Company is exposed are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Foreign currency risk is the risk that a variation in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies will affect the Company’s operations and financial results. The Company and its subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents and other assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency. TerrAscend does not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. Consequently, fluctuations in foreign currencies could have a negative impact on the profitability of TerrAscend's operations. A 10 % change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar would result in a change of $ 2,389 to the unrealized foreign exchange loss (gain). F- 58 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. In respect of financial assets, the Company's policy is to invest excess cash at floating rates of interest in cash equivalents, in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the value of cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in guaranteed investment certificates bear a fixed rate and are cashable at any time prior to maturity date. TerrAscend does not have significant cash equivalents at year. The Amended Gage Term Loan and the Pelorus Term Loan have variable interest rates that are tied to the U.S. ""prime rate"" and SOFR. At December 31, 2022, a 10 % change to each of the interest rates would result in a change to interest expense of $ 1,295 . The remainder of TerrAscend’s loans payable have fixed interest rates from 6 % to 12.875 % per annum. All other financial liabilities are non-interest-bearing instruments. 22. Commitments and contingencies Legal proceedings In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, product liability, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. At December 31, 2022 , there were no pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company's consolidated financial statements. 23. Subsequent events During January 2023, the Company received $ 12,667 , pursuant to a financing agreement with a third-party lender. In exchange, the Company assigned to the lender its interests in the $ 14,903 ERC claim that was submitted during December 2022 (refer to Note 3). If the Company does not receive the ERC claim, in whole or in part, the Company is required to repay the related portion of the funds received plus interest of 10% accrued from the date of the financing agreement through the repayment date. The Company's obligation under the financing agreement will be satisfied upon receipt of the ERC claim or other full repayment. On January 19, 2023, the Company entered into a multi-year agreement with Wana Brands (""Wana""), the leading edible manufacturer in North America, to introduce Wana's products at The Apothecarium retail stores and additional third-party retailers in New Jersey. The agreement will also transfer to TerrAscend, the manufacturing and sales of Wana's existing portfolio of products in Maryland. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will serve as the exclusive sole manufacturer, supplier, and commercial partner for Wana's products in New Jersey. On January 27, 2023, the C ompany closed on its previously announced acquisition of AMMD. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired 100 % equity interest in AMMD for total consideration of $ 10,000 in cash, in addition to entering into a long-term lease with the option to purchase the real estate. The Company now operates vertically integrated licensed operations in Maryland. On January 30, 2023, the Company appointed Jeroen De Beijer as Chief People and Culture Officer. On February 9, 2023, the Company opted to return its TerrAscend Canada standard cultivation license, standard processing license and license for sale for medical purposes under the Cannabis Act. On February 13, 2023, the Company launched adult-use cannabis sales at its Cookies Detroit retail location. Effective March 1, 2023, TerrAscend sold substantially all of the assets, including all intellectual property and inventory, at its Arise business to a third party. On March 15, 2023, WDB Holding PA, in exchange for a fee in the amount of 1 % of the then outstanding principal loan balance, agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the obligation date to prepay the Company's debt from March 15, 2023 to June 30, 2023 in which WDB Holding PA must use commercially reasonable efforts to add additional collateral to the Ilera Term Loan, (ii) increase the amount of debt to be reduced by up to $ 37,000 , subject to certain reductions F- 59 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) in amount based on meeting certain time based milestones, at a prepayment price of 103.22 % to par, and (iii) extend the next test date in respect of the interest coverage ratio until June 30, 2023.

With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, the Company has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which the Company operates; (iii) the output from the Company’s operations; (iv) consumer interest in the Company’s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of the Company’s activities and products and in the areas of taxation and environmental protection; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) the Company’s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; (x) the Company’s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner; and (xi) the Company’s construction plans and timeframe for completion of such plans. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K. Such lists include, without limitation, those discussed under Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in this Form 10-K.

If any of these risks actually occur, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company’s Common Shares would likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Set forth below is a summary of some of the principal risks the Company faces: • There is a substantial risk of regulatory or political change with respect to cannabis, which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business. • Compliance with regulations regarding cannabis is difficult, because the regulation of cannabis is uncertain and frequently changes.

Failure to develop new technologies and products could adversely affect the Company’s business. • The success of TerrAscend’s business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses and to retain key employees of acquired businesses. If the Company is unsuccessful in doing so, it may negatively affect TerrAscend’s business. • There can be no assurance that the Company’s current and future strategic alliances will have a beneficial impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. • The Company’s use of joint ventures may expose the Company to risks associated with jointly owned investments. • The Company may not realize the benefits of its growth strategy, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. 4 • The Company and Gage may not integrate successfully, which may prevent the realization of the benefits of the Transaction and may have a material adverse effect on the Company. • Reliance on licenses and transfers. • The issuance of a significant number of Common Shares and the resulting “market overhang” could adversely affect the market price of Common Shares after completion of the Transaction. • TerrAscend and Gage may be the target of securities class actions and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs to TerrAscend and may divert the attention of TerrAscend’s management, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company. • The Company’s voting control is concentrated. • The Company’s Preferred Shares have a liquidation preference over the Common Shares, which could limit the Company’s ability to make distributions to the holders of Common Shares. • An investor may face liquidity risks with an investment in the Common Shares. • The price of the Company’s Common Shares may be volatile, and may be adversely affected by the price of cannabis. • Additional issuances of the Company’s securities may result in dilution. • Sales of substantial amounts of Common Shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Common Shares. • Risks related to potential disqualification of equity holders by regulatory authorities. • TerrAscend does not intend to pay dividends on its Common Shares for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of the Company’s Common Shares. • TerrAscend may not be able to obtain necessary permits and authorizations. • TerrAscend may be subject to litigation, which could divert the attention of management and cause the Company to expend significant resources. • The Company needs to attract and retain customers and patients in order to succeed, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. • TerrAscend has a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects and predict future operating results. • The Company may be subject to growth-related risks, which could negatively affect its business. • The Company faces risks and hazards that may not be covered by insurance. 5 PAR T I ITEM 1.

The Company’s telephone number is 1.855.837.7295 and its website is www.terrascend.com . Recent Developments The Acquisition of Gage Growth Corp. On March 10, 2022, the Company closed its previously announced acquisition of Gage Growth Corp. (“Gage”) pursuant to an arrangement agreement dated August 31, 2021 (as amended) (the “Gage Acquisition”). The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares (or equivalent) of Gage. At closing, Gage shareholders received 51,349,978 Common Shares and an additional 25,811,460 of Common Shares are reserved for issuance in connection with the exercise or exchange of former Gage convertible securities that will be settled with the Company’s Common Shares if and when exercised or exchanged. Total consideration was approximately $386 million based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the 6 Canadian Stock Exchange ( “ CSE ” ) on March 9 , 2022 , to be issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration available under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Business of Gage Overview Gage provides support services to licensed Gage-branded cannabis cultivators, processors, and provisioning centers, and Cookies-branded provisioning centers, in the State of Michigan. Additionally, Gage has built strategic partnerships, and will continue to build strategic partnerships with leading cannabis brands in the US. Gage is focused on continuing to build a diverse portfolio of branded cannabis assets and business arrangements through investments, strategic business relationships and the pursuit of licenses in attractive retail locations in Michigan. More specifically, Gage, through its subsidiaries, has entered into a series of agreements whereby Gage’s subsidiaries provide various management, business consulting, accounting, administrative, human resources/personnel services, intellectual property, licensing, equipment, technological, financial, construction and real estate-related support services to certain license holders in exchange for certain fees. The license holders with which Gage has entered into such agreements are licensed cannabis cultivators that are engaged in growing, harvesting, and packaging medical and adult-use cannabis pursuant to Michigan law. Provisioning Centers The retail products sold in the State of Michigan by the license holders in such Gage-branded provisioning centers, which are commonly referred to as dispensaries in other states, are comprised of premium cannabis flower and cannabis products, including concentrates, edibles and vaporizer products. The top products in such provisioning centers include a broad range of flower products brands including Cookies, Gage, and Lemonnade branded strains of flower. In addition, Gage, through the license holders, offers a wide variety of concentrate, edibles and vaporizer products. The license holders sell cannabis products for the medical and adult-use retail market through the existing Gage-branded provisioning centers and are currently seeking additional medical and adult-use licenses to expand the Gage-branded provisioning center footprint within the state of Michigan. As of December 31, 2021, Gage supported the operation of eleven provisioning centers, all of which held medical licenses and nine of which held adult-use licenses. Cultivation Gage provides support services to its license holders, which operate three cultivation facilities within the state of Michigan with approximately 70,000 square feet of cultivation assets. In addition, Gage has plans through these license holders to expand to over 150,000 square feet of cultivation assets by mid 2022. Also, in 2020, Gage entered into agreements with third-party run cultivation facilities to grow flower for these license holders, which began receiving product from these third-party facilities in early 2021. In total, these agreements are expected to allow Gage, through the license holders, to significantly expand flower growing capacity. As of December 31, 2021, Gage, through these license holders, has entered into eleven contract grow agreements (the “Grow Agreements”) with ten third-party Michigan cannabis license holders (“Contract Growers”) pursuant to which each Contract Grower will cultivate certain products, including “Gage” and “Cookies” branded products. According to the Grow Agreements, five license holders will provide certain cannabis genetics and advise on cannabis grow processes and quality control standards, and will be responsible for its own facility and cultivation processes. Additional production coming from each Contract Grower is expected to enable Gage to significantly increase the product availabilities across its provisioning centers as well as meeting consumer demand. Gage is currently preparing its processing facility located in Monitor Township, Michigan to become operational. The processing facility will primarily be used to produce Gage’s in-house concentrate products. Currently, Gage is purchasing the majority of the concentrate products from third parties, which results in compressed margins.

Arise’s whole-plant hemp extract products are made in the US and are available for sale in retail locations in the US. TerrAscend Canada TerrAscend Canada is a Licensed Producer (as such term is defined in the Cannabis Act) of cannabis in Canada, and its current principal business activities include the sale of recreational (“recreational” or “adult-use”) cannabis to provincial cannabis wholesalers and retailers. 8 TerrAscend Canada operates out of a 67,300 square foot facility located in Mississauga, Ontario and is licensed to cultivate, process and sell cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes. These licenses allow for sales of dried cannabis, cannabis oil and extracts, topicals, and edibles. TerrAscend Canada sells products nationally under the Haven Street and Legend brands in the dried flower, vapes, and edibles categories. A strategic decision was made to cease the growing and cultivation of cannabis in Canada in order to focus on more profitable distribution opportunities. The final harvest from its manufacturing facility occurred in September 2020. Reorganization Entry into the US Cannabis Market and Capital Reorganization On October 9, 2018, TerrAscend announced its intention to pursue growth opportunities in the US cannabis market, including potential acquisitions of operators in states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. Although TerrAscend at the time did not engage in the business of, or derive any revenue from, the cultivation, distribution or possession of cannabis in the US, TerrAscend announced that it had identified certain acquisition prospects with significant market share and strong brand recognition. To support its new strategy, TerrAscend entered into an agreement with Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy Growth”), RIV Capital Inc. (formerly Canopy Rivers Inc.) (“RIV Capital”), and entities controlled by Jason Wild, chairman of TerrAscend (JW Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd., JW Partners, LP, and Pharmaceutical Opportunities Fund, LP) to reorganize the capital of TerrAscend (the “TerrAscend Reorganization”) and obtain waivers of certain contractual covenants that at the time, restricted TerrAscend from operating in the US. The TerrAscend Reorganization was implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement on the terms set out in the Arrangement Agreement and was subject to court approval, the approval of TerrAscend’s shareholders, and other customary conditions. The TerrAscend Reorganization was completed on November 30, 2018. Acquisitions Acquisition of Grander Assets On December 24, 2018, TerrAscend announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Grander, a manufacturer and distributor of hemp-derived wellness products. The transaction closed on January 15, 2019. Substantially all of the operating assets of Grander were indirectly acquired by TerrAscend through a wholly owned subsidiary Arise. As consideration, TerrAscend paid $12.7 million, comprising $6.5 million in cash, 1,362,343 Common Shares, and $0.5 million in working capital adjustments. The fair value of the Common Shares was $5.1 million as at January 15, 2019. Subject to meeting certain earnings milestones, TerrAscend agreed to pay up to an additional $10 million in cash or share considerations. The total value of the potential purchase consideration payable by TerrAscend under the terms of the agreement was approximately $22.7 million, and the fair value of the contingent consideration was $0.6 million as at January 15, 2019. Based on performance of the Arise business during the measurement period, the milestones for the additional $10 million payment were not met and the total purchase consideration paid by TerrAscend remained $12.7 million. Acquisition of The Apothecarium Dispensaries in Northern California On June 6, 2019, TerrAscend closed a series of transactions to acquire controlling interests in three entities in California operating the retail dispensary brand known as “The Apothecarium.” The transactions also included the acquisition of entities that were seeking to operate two additional retail locations in Northern California, which were ultimately opened in Berkeley and Capitola, and Valhalla, a leading provider of premium edible products. TerrAscend acquired 49.9% of the outstanding equity interests of the entities operating the three San Francisco The Apothecarium Dispensary locations and TerrAscend has the right (or, in certain circumstances, obligation) to acquire the remaining equity interests of those entities post-closing, following receipt of certain regulatory approvals. As consideration, TerrAscend paid $71.8 million, comprising $36.8 million in cash, $1.1 million in the form of a working capital adjustment, contingent consideration of $3 million and 6,700 TerrAscend proportionate voting shares (“Proportionate Voting Shares”). The fair value of the share consideration at June 6, 2019 was $30.9 million. TerrAscend retains 100% of the economics of entities operating the three San Francisco locations and the Berkeley and Capitola locations of The Apothecarium Dispensaries through control of such entities. Acquisition of Ilera On September 16, 2019, TerrAscend acquired 100% of the equity of the entities comprising Ilera for total consideration of $225 million paid in a combination of cash and Common Shares. At closing, TerrAscend paid to the sellers $25 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, an additional $25 million worth of Proportionate Voting Shares in the equity of TerrAscend equivalent to approximately 5,059.102 Proportionate Voting Shares (which are each exchangeable for 1,000 9 Common Shares), and $601,000 in working capital adjustments. Additional cash consideration of $175 million in aggregate was paid to the sellers based on Ilera achieving certain specified sales and profitability targets, with staged payments made in 2020 and 2021. On June 30, 2021 the final earn-out had been calculated and remaining fair value amount of $29.7 million was paid on that date. Acquisition of State Flower On January 23, 2020, TerrAscend obtained control of ABI SF LLC, owner of State Flower, a premium California cannabis brand that is currently sold through dispensaries in California. As consideration, the Company converted its previously issued note receivable and accrued interest in the amount of $3 million into a 49.9% equity interest in State Flower. The Company also recorded contingent consideration payable of $6.6 million, representing the expected consideration payable to acquire the remaining 50.1% of State Flower, which comprises 100% of its preferred shares, subject to regulatory approval. TerrAscend retains 100% of the economics of State Flower through control of ABI SF LLC and has the right to acquire the remaining equity interests of ABI SF LLC, for no additional consideration, following receipt of certain regulatory approvals. On December 31, 2021, the final earn-out has been calculated. The Company made a payment of $6,954 in January 2022. The remaining amount will be paid to the sellers of State Flower upon the Company’s acquisition of the remaining 50.1% of State Flower. Acquisition of HMS On May 3, 2021, TerrAscend, through a wholly owned subsidiary, WDB MD, acquired HMS, a cultivator of cannabis flower for the wholesale medical cannabis market in Maryland. TerrAscend acquired 100% of the equity of HMS Health and the rights to acquire 100% of the equity of HMS Processing, a processor of cannabis flower, post-closing following receipt of certain regulatory approvals, for total consideration of $24.5 million comprised of $22.4 million in cash and a $2.1 million note, which bears 5.0% annual interest, due April 2022. TerrAscend retains 100% of the economics of HMS through full ownership of HMS Health and a master services agreement with HMS Processing. Acquisition of Keystone Canna Remedies On April 30, 2021, TerrAscend, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired KCR. The transaction added three retail dispensaries located in Bethlehem, Allentown and Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Prior to the acquisition, TerrAscend owned 10% of KCR. TerrAscend acquired the remaining 90% of the equity for total consideration of $69.8 million comprised of $34.4 million in Common Shares, $20.5 million in cash, $7.1 million related to the fair value in previously owned shares, and a $6.8 million note which bears 10% annual interest, due April 2022. New Jersey Partnership On August 20, 2021, the Company purchased an additional 12.5% (previously owned 75%), with an option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership, of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ from BWH NJ, LLC and Blue Marble Ventures, LLC for a total consideration of $50,000, which was paid during the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon closing of the agreement, the Company now owns 87.5% of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ. The Company has the option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership, for a total of 93.75%, at a predetermined valuation during the period commencing April 1, 2023 through June 15, 2023. Acquisition of Gage For more information regarding the Acquisition of Gage, please see Item 1 – “ Business ” – “ Recent Developments ” – “ The Acquisition of Gage Growth Corp .” Principal Products The Company offers a competitive product portfolio in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Depending on the jurisdiction, the Company offers a variety of products, including, flower, concentrates, edibles and/or accessories. In addition, the Company has continually been at the forefront of developing and introducing innovative products to serve patients’ and customers’ unique needs. For example, effective August 18, 2021, TerrAscend NJ signed an exclusive agreement to supply Cookies licensed product to the New Jersey market and to bring “Cookies Corners” to its three dispensaries in New Jersey. Principal Markets The Company’s operations are currently limited to the US and Canada. In the US, the Company sells cannabis products in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and California and with the recent consummation of the Gage Transaction, the Company now also sells cannabis products in Michigan. In Canada, the Company produces and sells products in all provinces and 10 territories. The Company ’ s Arise business also sells whole-plant hemp extract products in retail locations across the US where legally permitted. TerrAscend ’ s business is not generally cyclical or seasonal in nature. Distribution Methods The Company distributes its branded products across dispensaries in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and California and with the recent consummation of the Gage Transaction, the Company has begun managing distribution of cannabis products in Michigan. In Canada, the Company sells its products to provincial and territorial wholesalers and retailers. The Company’s Arise business also sells whole-plant hemp extract products in retail locations across the US where legally permitted. Production Facilities The Company currently operates seven cultivation, manufacturing and warehouse facilities in the US and Canada. See Item 2 – “ Properties .” Sources and Availability of Materials The Company grows or procures the primary component of its finished products, namely cannabis. The Company’s cultivation operations are dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to its growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other utilities. Specialized Knowledge and Skills All aspects of TerrAscend’s business requires specialized skills and knowledge. TerrAscend believes its team has developed and sourced business systems to effectively and efficiently operate its wholesale operations and retail cannabis operations across North America. The brand building, retail marketing and product development knowledge and skills of TerrAscend’s management team and employees will be essential to TerrAscend becoming a well-respected household name within the retail cannabis industry. Please see Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” – “ Risks Related to TerrAscend’s Business, Operations and Industry ” – “ The Company is dependent on suppliers and key inputs for the cultivation, extraction and production of cannabis products .” Competitive Conditions TerrAscend faces, and will continue to face, competition from new and existing licensed cannabis operators, competitors with existing retail operations, government owned retailers and the illicit market and other applicable participants in the cannabis wholesale and manufacturing industry. Some of the competitors of TerrAscend may have greater financial resources, market access and manufacturing and marketing experience than TerrAscend. Increased competition by numerous independent cannabis retail outlets and larger and better financed competitors (including new entrants) could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. TerrAscend’s competition can be grouped into the following categories: (a) Vertically Integrated Competitors: This class of competitors (which may include licensed producers of cannabis that are able to produce cannabis and cannabis products sold at retail stores of their affiliates) includes well-financed competitors with an established operating history in North America. (b) Existing Retailers: This class of competitors includes early-stage and semi-developed retail cannabis businesses, as well as established retail cannabis businesses, which may be well capitalized, and which may also have an established and longer retail operating history in North America. (c) Government Competition: This class of competitors includes government wholesalers that sell directly to consumers in the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. (d) Illicit Market: This class of competitors includes individuals and businesses operating in the illicit market within various jurisdictions across North America. These competitors may divert sizeable commercial opportunities from TerrAscend. (e) Existing Wholesalers: This class of competitors includes early-stage and semi-developed wholesalers, as well as established wholesalers, which may be well capitalized, and which may also have an established and longer retail operating history in North America. 11 Protection of Intellectual Property The ownership and protection of TerrAscend’s intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of TerrAscend’s future success. Currently the Company relies on trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information. The Company protects its intellectual property by seeking and obtaining registered protection where possible, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information and entering into restrictive agreements with parties that have access to the Company’s inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as TerrAscend’s partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership. The Company also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its inventions, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of the Company’s premises and physical and electronic security of its information technology systems. In addition, the Company has sought and will continue to seek trademark protection in the US and Canada. TerrAscend’s ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada, including the US, where registered federal trademark protection is currently unavailable for trademarks covering marijuana-related products and services that are illegal under the CSA. Accordingly, TerrAscend’s ability to obtain intellectual property rights or enforce intellectual property rights against third party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain countries. The US Patent and Trademark Office released a policy on May 2, 2019 that clarifies that applications for trademarks for products that meet the definition of hemp could be accepted for registration, with certain exceptions. Human Capital As of December 31, 2021, TerrAscend employed 821 employees, none of whom were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Of these employees, approximately 742 were full-time. The Company believes it has a good relationship with its employees. TerrAscend believes in building a diverse team, and it strives to make the Company a welcoming space where everyone can make an impact on the Company’s success. TerrAscend encourages talented people from all backgrounds to join the Company and strives to make it a place of inclusion. TerrAscend takes seriously the health and safety of the Company’s employees and customers and so, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented extended health and safety protocols in all of TerrAscend’s locations. These protocols require appropriate social distancing where work duties permit, allow individuals who are able to fulfill their work duties remotely to work from home, require masks and/or face coverings while individuals are in the workplace, institute regular cleaning and sanitization measures, and put in place appropriate reporting and communication procedures to ensure maintenance of required confidentiality while also providing sufficient information for employees to make educated decisions regarding their health. TerrAscend monitors and follows relevant guidance from the Center for Disease Control and other health and safety experts. The Company is committed to providing a safe and secure work environment in accordance with applicable labor, safety, health, anti-discrimination and other workplace laws. TerrAscend strives for all the Company’s employees to feel safe and empowered at work. To that end, the Company maintains a hotline that employees can call, with the option of remaining anonymous, to voice concerns.

Licenses and Regulatory Framework in US The Company and its subsidiaries, as applicable, currently hold all necessary state licenses and permits to carry on the activities it conducts. See Appendix A – “ List of Licenses and Permits of TerrAscend Corp. ” Summary of US Cannabis Regulatory Regime The cannabis industry is subject to various state and local laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale, storage and disposal of medical and recreational cannabis, as well as laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. The US regulatory scheme varies in its terminology and definitions, using “cannabis”, “marijuana” and “hemp” as distinct terms. The regulatory environment governing the medical and recreational marijuana industries in the US, where state law permits such activities, are, and will continue to be, subject to evolving regulation by governmental authorities. Accordingly, there are a number of risks associated with investing in businesses in an evolving regulatory environment, including, without limitation, increased industry competition, rapid consolidation of industry participants and potential insolvency of industry participants. 38 states plus the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and Guam that have authorized medical marijuana and approximately 18 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Northern Marina Islands who have authorized adult-use (i.e. recreational) marijuana. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of medical, and in some cases also recreational marijuana at the state level, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug under the CSA, making it illegal under US federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute, sell or possess marijuana in the US. Furthermore, financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the US may form the basis for prosecution under applicable US federal money laundering legislation. The US federal government’s approach to enforcement of marijuana laws has trended toward deference to state laws where a robust state regulatory framework exists. On August 29, 2013, the US Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) issued a memorandum known as the “Cole Memorandum” to all US Attorneys’ offices. The Cole Memorandum generally directed US Attorneys not 13 to prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws against individuals and businesses that comply with state medical marijuana programs. The Cole Memorandum, while not legally binding and only a policy statement, assisted in managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning all medical and adult-use state-regulated marijuana businesses. On January 4, 2018, the Cole Memorandum was rescinded by former Attorney General Sessions. While this did not create a change in federal law, the revocation added to the uncertainty of US federal enforcement of the CSA in states where marijuana use is regulated. Former Attorney General Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum” which confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained that the Cole Memorandum was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance as set forth in the US Attorney’s Manual. While the Sessions Memorandum does emphasize that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and states the statutory view that it is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise indicate that the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses is a heightened DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion. Such prosecutorial discretion remains in the hands of US Attorneys when deciding whether or not to prosecute marijuana-related offenses. On November 7, 2018, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned as US Attorney General. On February 14, 2019, William Barr was confirmed by the US Senate as the next Attorney General. During one of his Senate confirmation hearings, Mr. Barr stated that he did not support cannabis legalization but would not prosecute cannabis businesses that comply with state laws. Mr. Barr stated further that he would not upset settled expectations that have arisen as a result of the Cole Memorandum. On March 11, 2021, Merrick Garland was appointed US Attorney General. Mr. Garland indicated he would generally act in accordance with the Cole Memorandum, when, at his confirmation hearing, he said, “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.” He has not, however, reissued the Cole Memorandum or issued substitute guidance. While enforcement of federal laws against regulated state entities does not appear to be a US DOJ priority, the US DOJ may change its enforcement policies at any time, with or without advance notice. For the reasons set forth herein, the Company’s existing investments in the US, and any future investments, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, the Company may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to invest in the US or any other jurisdiction. Government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the marijuana industry in the US or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public’s perception of marijuana in the US or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, such a shift could cause state and local jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical or recreational marijuana, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which the Company could expand. Any inability to fully implement the Company’s expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, under US federal law, it may be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of marijuana or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the US, could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to marijuana businesses. It may also be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for “federal health care law violations,” which include violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Violations of any US federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities, civil forfeiture or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its marijuana licenses in the US, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for the Company to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s investments and operations in the US may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. The Company may also be subject to a variety of laws and regulations domestically and in the US that relate to money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), the Proceeds of 14 Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Criminal Code (Canada) and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the US and Canada. Further, under US federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a marijuana business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy. In February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on marijuana-related violations of the CSA and independently lists the federal government’s enforcement priorities as related to marijuana. Although the original FinCEN Memorandum is still in place, this supplementary Department of Justice guidance that accompanied the FinCEN Memorandum was rescinded when former Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. It is unclear whether the current administration will follow the guidelines of the FinCEN Memorandum, although immediately after the Sessions Memorandum, then-US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that the Treasury Department had no intention to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum but, instead, wanted to improve the availability of banking services in the state-regulated marijuana space. The position of current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is relatively unknown. In the foreseeable future, the Company expects any amounts payable by the Company from its subsidiaries to remain in the US to fund the further development of its businesses. The Company may also consider future debt or equity financings. H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, which would expand financial services in the US to marijuana-related legitimate businesses and service providers, was introduced in the US House of Representatives (the “House”) on March 7, 2019 with bipartisan support. On April 11, 2019, S. 1200, the US Senate (the “Senate”) version of the SAFE Banking Act, was filed. This bill also has bipartisan support and more than a fifth of the total Senate, 27 members, co-sponsored it. On September 25, 2019, H.R. 1595 passed in the House by a vote of 321 to 103, but it stalled in the US Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on May 15, 2020, when it was included in the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act. However, that measure also stalled in the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on April 19, 2021 as H.R. 1996, by a vote of 321 – 101. The bill was received by the Senate and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, where it remained. On September 23, 2021, the House approved the National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) that contained the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The SAFE Banking Act was subsequently removed from the NDAA by the House-Senate conference committee on December 7, 2021, and was not included in the final version of the NDAA. On February 4, 2022, the House passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022, which included the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The legislation is now before the Senate for its consideration. Other legislation that has been introduced in the US that would make cannabis transactions easier and more predictable, include the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the “MORE Act”) and the Cannabis Administration and Opportunities Act (the “CAOA”). The MORE Act was first introduced in July 2019 by Representative Jerrold Nadler in the House, and in the Senate by then-US Senator Kamala Harris. If it were to become law, the MORE Act would remove cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and make available US Small Business Administration funding for regulated cannabis operators. The MORE Act was reintroduced in the current US Congress (“Congress”) by Representative Nadler on May 28, 2021, with no corresponding bill introduced in the Senate. The CAOA was released as a discussion draft by US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, US Senator Ron Wyden, and US Senator Cory Booker in July 2021. If it were to become law it would, among other things, remove cannabis from the definition of a controlled substance under the CSA, allow states to set their own regulations for cannabis, and block states from prohibiting interstate commerce of regulated cannabis across their borders. Recently introduced into Congress is another bill, the States Reform Act (“SRA”), introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), which would repeal the federal prohibition of cannabis. It is unlikely that the MORE Act, the CAOA, or the SRA will pass both the House and the Senate and be signed into law this year. Based on the momentum seen last year, legislative efforts to legalize cannabis or cannabis banking at the national level are likely to continue this year. Depending on the political winds and the outcome of federal elections, it is possible but not certain that one or more of these bills could become law sometime in the coming years. Despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, one legislative safeguard for the medical marijuana industry remains in place. Congress has used a rider known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment in the fiscal year 2015, 2016 and 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Acts (the “RBA”) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. However, this measure does not protect adult-use marijuana businesses. As part of the $1.3 trillion federal spending bill enacted on March 23, 2018, Congress renewed the RBA through September 2018, and subsequently extended it further. The RBA is an appropriations rider that prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent states from implementing marijuana 15 laws. The US Ninth Circuit in United States v. McIntosh held that the prohibition under the RBA also prevents the DOJ from spending federal funds to prosecute individuals who are engaged in conduct that is permitted by, and in compliance with, state medical marijuana laws. In July 2020, the House introduced a base appropriations bill with the RBA included, and this amendment was renewed through stopgap funding bills on October 1, December 11, December 18, December 20, and December 22, 2020, until an amendment was renewed through the passage and Presidential signing of H.R. 133, which was effective through September 30, 2021. On September 30, 2021 , December 3, 2021, and February 18, 2022, President Biden signed short-term stopgap spending bills to extend current appropriations, most recently through March 11 , 2022. There is no assurance that Congress will approve inclusion of a similar prohibition on DOJ spending in the appropriation bills for future years. State-Level Overview The following section presents an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the marijuana industry in US states in which the Company has or is intending to have an operating presence and is presented as of the date of filing, unless otherwise indicated. California In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act, allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying medical conditions including chronic pain. The law established a not-for-profit patient/caregiver system but there was no state licensing authority to oversee the businesses that emerged as a result of the system. In September of 2015, the California legislature passed three bills, collectively known as the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act. In 2016, California voters passed The Adult Use of Marijuana Act, which legalized recreational use cannabis for adults 21 years of age and older and created a licensing system for commercial cannabis businesses. Note, California defines “cannabis” to mean “marijuana.” On June 27, 2017, then-Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 94 into law, which combined California’s medicinal and recreational use cannabis frameworks into one licensing structure under the Medicinal and Adult-Use of Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”). Pursuant to MAUCRSA: (i) CalCannabis, a division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was designated to issue licenses to cannabis cultivators: (ii) the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch (the “MCSB”), a division of the California Department of Public Health, was designated to issue licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (iii) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via its agency the Bureau of Cannabis Control (the “BCC”), was designated to issue licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers, and micro-businesses. These agencies were also charged with overseeing various aspects of implementing and maintaining California’s cannabis landscape, including the statewide track and trace system. All three agencies released their initial emergency rulemakings at the end of 2017 and updated them with minor revisions in June 2018. The three agencies adopted their permanent rulemakings on January 16, 2019. All three agencies began issuing temporary licenses in January 2018 and stopped doing so on December 31, 2018, pursuant to MAUCRSA. Local authorization is a prerequisite to obtaining a state license, and local governments are permitted to prohibit or otherwise regulate the types and number of cannabis businesses allowed in their locality. All three state regulatory agencies require confirmation from the applicable locality that the operator is operating in compliance with local requirements and was granted authorization to continue or commence commercial cannabis operations within the locality’s jurisdiction. Applicants are required to comply with all local zoning and land use requirements and provide written authorization from the property owner where the commercial cannabis operations are proposed to take place, which must dictate that the applicant has the property owner’s authorization to engage in the specific state-sanctioned commercial cannabis activities proposed to occur on the premises. The State has not set a limit on the number of state licenses an entity may hold, unlike other states that have restricted how many cannabis licenses an entity may hold in total or for various types of cannabis activity. Although vertical integration across multiple license types is allowed under MAUCRSA, testing laboratory licensees may not hold any other licenses aside from a laboratory license. There are also no residency requirements for ownership of a state license under MAUCRSA. California state licenses, and some local licenses, are renewed annually. Each year, licensees are required to submit a state renewal application to the relevant regulatory authority, and all applicable local renewal applications to the applicable local regulatory body (for local licenses) such as the Department of Cannabis Regulation in the City of Los Angeles. On July 12, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-141 into law, triggering the consolidation of CalCannabis, the MCSB, and the BCC into the newly created Department of Cannabis Control (the “DCC”). The DCC was created in an effort to centralize regulatory authority and facilitate a more easily navigable regulatory regime. All licenses obtained under the previous regulatory authorities automatically transferred to the DCC, which will be responsible for issuing and renewing all cannabis licenses moving forward. In September 2021 the DCC issued emergency regulations, which were approved and went into effect the same month. The emergency regulations, among other things, include revised definitions clarifying who are considered to 16 be owners or holders of a financial stake in cannabis businesses, and provisions allowing for the sale of branded products between businesses. California’s robust regulatory system is designed to ensure, monitor, and enforce compliance with all aspects of a cannabis operator’s licensed operations. California’s state license application process additionally requires comprehensive criminal, regulatory, financial and personal disclosures, coupled with stringent monitoring and continuous reporting requirements designed to ensure only good actors are granted licenses and that licensees continue to operate in compliance with the state regulatory program. Applicants must submit standard operating procedures describing how the operator will, among other requirements, secure the facility, manage inventory, comply with the state’s seed-to-sale tracking requirements, dispense cannabis, and handle waste, as applicable to the license sought. Once licensed, an operator must continue to abide by the processes described in its application and seek regulatory approval before any changes to such procedures can be made. Licensees are additionally required to train their employees on compliant operations and are only permitted to transact with other legal and licensed businesses. As a condition of state licensure, operators must consent to random and unannounced inspections of their commercial cannabis facility as well as all of the facility’s books and records, so as to monitor and enforce compliance with state law. Many localities have also enacted similar standards for inspections, and the state has already commenced site-visits and compliance inspections for operators who have received state temporary or annual licensure. New Jersey On January 18, 2010, the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act (the “CUMMA”) came into force allowing patients with a limited number of qualifying medial conditions to access the state’s medical marijuana program. The New Jersey Department of Health (the “NJDOH”) issued regulations shortly thereafter authorizing the NJDOH to accept applications for a minimum of six alternative treatment centers (the “ATCs”), with two each to operate in the north, central and south regions of New Jersey. CUMMA permits each ATC to operate as both a cultivator and dispensary under one permit. These activities can take place at up to two locations, as long as both locations are within the same region. The application process involves two stages. Those seeking an ATC permit must first submit an application seeking authority to apply for a permit to operate. Upon the granting of the application, the prospective ATC must then complete the application for actual permitting. Applications for authority to apply for a permit may only be submitted following solicitation from NJDOH for such applications. The first six permits for ATCs were awarded to nonprofit entities, with subsequent permits to be available to both nonprofit and for-profit entities. In 2013, CUMMA was amended to allow ATCs to cultivate an unlimited number of strains of marijuana and sell additional marijuana-infused products, and to restrict the same of marijuana-infused edible products to qualifying patients under the age of 18. With additional authorizations, ATCs may also house manufacturing facilities for marijuana-infused products such as syrups and lozenges. All marijuana is subject to a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) limit of 10%, though NJDOH is proposing to repeal the regulation that establishes this limit. Upon taking office on January 16, 2018, Governor Murphy expanded the medical program by issuing Executive Order No. 6, which ordered a 60-day review of all aspects of New Jersey’s current program, “with a focus on ways to expand access to marijuana for medical purposes.” In response to Executive Order No. 6, NJDOH released its EO 6 Report on March 23, 2018, which proposed significant changes to the existing medicinal program. In an effort to create greater patient access, the state immediately put into effect some of the recommended changes, including cutting registration and renewal fees, and expanding qualifying conditions. On July 16, 2018, the Murphy Administration announced that the licensing application process would be opened for up to six additional vertically integrated medicinal marijuana ATCs. The NJDOH released a Notice of Request for Applications outlining the reason for issuing the licenses, eligibility rules and information required for the applications. The application period opened on August 1, 2018 and closed on August 31, 2018. Winning applicants were supposed to be selected on or before November 1, 2018 but this deadline was subsequently pushed to December due to administrative constraints. On December 17, 2018, NJDOH revealed the additional six medical marijuana ATCs it picked to add to the program. New Jersey will now have 12 vertically-integrated ATCs across the state, if these additional six applicant ATCs become operational. These six applicant ATCs now must pass background checks, provide evidence of cultivation and dispensary locations with municipal approval for each location, and comply with all regulations promulgated by the NJDOH, including safety and security requirements. On March 25, 2019, a planned vote on legislative package including medical expansion and adult-use legalization was pulled due to a lack of votes necessary to pass the legislation through the state Senate. This setback came after significant momentum had helped to pass the bill through the appropriations and judiciary committees earlier in the month. After the package of cannabis reforms stalled, Governor Murphy announced he would be expanding the medical program through administrative action. This announcement has proved contentious as the Senate President claims any regulatory changes for medical cannabis 17 would make securing the votes necessary to pass adult-use legalization more difficult. On May 14, 2019, the Senate President announced he would no longer work to advance adult-use legalization through the legislature and instead would pivot to put the issue before voters for the 2020 general election. While legalization stalled, bills to expand the state ’ s medical program and reform criminal penalties continued to move forward. On December 18, 2020, Governor Murphy signed A. 5981/S. 4154 into law, which facilitates the expungement of low-level marijuana crimes and other offenses. And, on November 3, 2020, New Jersey voters passed a ballot measure amending the New Jersey Constitution to permit the use of marijuana for adults over 21 years of age. The ballot measure will also allow New Jersey to regulate the growth, distribution, and sale of adult-use marijuana. On November 4, 2020, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal issued a statement reminding New Jersey residents that the state ’ s criminal laws related to marijuana still apply until the state legislature enacts a framework for adult-use cannabis. On February 22, 2021, Governor Murphy signed the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (“CREAMMA”) into law, legalizing the use of marijuana by adults 21 years of age and older in New Jersey. On August 19, 2021, New Jersey’s Cannabis Regulatory Commission (“CRC”) published its first set of rules associated with adult-use cannabis in the state. These rules outline the details of licensing, the authority of municipalities, the operations of cannabis businesses, and the CRC’s authority over adult-use cannabis. Additional rules are expected as New Jersey’s adult-use program continues toward becoming operational. The goal date for adult-use cannabis sales to begin under CREAMMA was no later than 180 days after the adoption of initial rules promulgated under CREAMMA, or mid-February 2022. The CRC missed that deadline and has indicated that its new target date to launch adult-use cannabis sales is March 15, 2022. There is no guarantee the new date will be met. Pennsylvania The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with one or more of 17 qualifying conditions, including: epilepsy, chronic pain and PTSD. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations per retail license). On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would initiate its rollout, which included 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional dispensary licenses. Additionally, the list of qualifying conditions was expanded from 17 to 21. On July 20, 2019, two more qualifying medical conditions were added, bringing the total to 23. There are two principal license categories in Pennsylvania: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. All cultivation/processing establishments and dispensaries must register with Pennsylvania Department of Health. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. The Pennsylvania Department of Health must renew a permit unless it determines the applicant is unlikely to maintain effective control against diversion of medical cannabis and the applicant is unlikely to comply with all laws as prescribed under the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program. Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the license holder to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell and purchase medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health under the provisions of Medical Marijuana Act and Pennsylvania regulations. The medical cultivation/processing licenses permit the licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. The retail dispensary licenses permit the Company to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products. Maryland The Maryland medical cannabis program was signed into law on May 2, 2013. In 2016, the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission issued preliminary licenses to 102 dispensaries, 15 cultivators, and 15 processors; the first dispensaries opened to patients in December 2017. Maryland has three classes of cannabis licenses: dispensaries, cultivators, and processors. Wholesaling occurs between cultivators and processors, cultivators and dispensaries, and processors and dispensaries. Originally, no one Company could directly control multiple licenses of the same class, but this restriction was changed in May 2019 when Governor Hogan signed a bill that permitted a single company to own or control, including the power to manage or operate, up to four dispensaries. Dispensary locations are tied to the Senate District in which they were awarded, with the exception of dispensary licenses that 18 were awarded to applicants who also were awarded a cultivation license. These dispensaries can be located at the discretion of the license holder. Permitted products include oil-based formulations, flower, and edibles. In April 2018, the Maryland House and Senate approved a bill, which was later signed by Governor Hogan, that expanded the license pool, allowing for a maximum of seven additional cultivation licenses, for a total of 22, and 13 additional processing licenses, for a total of 28. As of March 1, 2022, there were approximately 95 licensed dispensaries, 18 licensed cultivators, and 19 licensed processors. Michigan In November 2008, Michigan residents approved the Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative to provide a legal framework for individuals with certain debilitating medical conditions to lawfully use marijuana for medicinal purposes. In September 2016, the Michigan Legislature passed, and Governor Snyder signed into law, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act (the “MMFLA”) and the Marihuana Tracking Act (the “MTA”) to provide a comprehensive licensing and tracking scheme, respectively, for state’s medical marijuana program. In 2018, Michigan voters approved Proposal 1, to make marijuana legal under state and local law for adults 21 years of age or older and to control the commercial production and distribution of marijuana under a system that licenses, regulates, and taxes the businesses involved. The proposal is known as the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act (the “MRTMA” and together with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (the “MMMA”), the MMFLA, and the MTA, the “Michigan Cannabis Laws”). Additionally, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (“LARA”) and the MRA have supplemented the Michigan Cannabis Laws with administrative rules and bulletins to further clarify the regulatory landscape surrounding the state’s medical and adult use marijuana programs. The MRA is the main regulatory authority for the licensing and regulation of medical and adult use marijuana businesses, and is an agency within LARA. Under the MMFLA, the MRA administrates five types of “state operating licenses” for medical marijuana businesses: (a) a “grower” license, including three different classes of licenses: (i) a Class A license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 500 plants; (ii) a Class B license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 1,000 plants; and (iii) a Class C license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 1,500 plants, (b) a “processor” license, (c) a “secure transporter” license, (d) a “provisioning center” license and (e) a “safety compliance facility” license. Likewise, under the MRTMA, the MRA administers six types of “state licenses” for adult use marijuana business: (a) a “marihuana grower” license, including three different classes of licenses: (i) a Class A license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 100 plants; (ii) a Class B license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 500 plants; and (iii) a Class C license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 2,000 plants, (b) a “marihuana processor” license, (c) a “secure transporter” license, (d) a “marihuana retailer” license, (e) a “marihuana safety compliance facility” license, and (f) a “marihuana microbusiness” license. However, MRTMA also allows the MRA to create additional license types through the administrative rulemaking process. To date, the MRA has created four additional license types: (a) a “designated consumption establishment” license, (b) an “excess marihuana grower” license, (c) a “marihuana event organizer” license, and (d) a “temporary marihuana event” license. Importantly, each excess marihuana grower license allows an entity that holds five adult use Class C grower licenses issued under MRTMA and at least two medical Class C grower licenses issued under the MMFLA to grow an additional 2,000 plants. Under both MRTMA and the MMFLA, there are no stated limits on the number of licenses that can be made available on a state level; however, the MRA has discretion over the approval of applications and municipalities can pass additional restrictions, including limiting the number and type of licenses that can be issued within their jurisdiction. Additionally, a person or entity cannot possess or own both a grower/process/provisioning center and a secure transporter license or a safety compliance lab. US Hemp Regime The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law on December 20, 2018. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removed “hemp” (including any part of the cannabis plant containing 0.3% THC or less), its extracts, derivatives, and cannabinoids from the CSA definition of “marihuana”, and allows for federally-sanctioned hemp production under the purview of the US Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), in coordination with state departments of agriculture that elect to have primary regulatory authority. States and Tribal governments can adopt their own regulatory plans, even if more restrictive than federal regulations, so long as the plans meet minimum federal standards and are approved by the USDA. Hemp production in jurisdictions that do not choose to submit their own plans (and that do not otherwise prohibit hemp production) will be governed by USDA regulation. “Hemp” as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, “means the plant Cannabis sativa L., and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, 19 isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.” While the 2018 Farm Bill removes hemp and hemp-derived products from the controlled substances list under the CSA, it does not legalize cannabidiol (“CBD”) in every circumstance. While not independently scheduled under the CSA, CBD, depending on the source from which it was derived and its THC concentration, can still be classified as a Schedule I substance under the CSA’s definition of “marihuana.” Further, although the 2018 Farm Bill creates a limited exception to this prohibition, this exception only applies if the CBD is derived from “hemp” as defined in federal law. Federal law also requires that: (i) the hemp is produced by a Licensed Producer; and (ii) in a manner consistent with the applicable federal and state regulations. CBD and other cannabinoids produced from marihuana as defined by the CSA remain an illegal Schedule I substance under federal law. In addition, many state laws include all CBD within definitions of marijuana and some states have policies or laws that otherwise prohibit or restrict CBD sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2018 Farm Bill expressly preserves the US Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate certain products under the FDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA takes the position that because CBD was the subject of substantial clinical investigations that have been made public and is the active ingredient in an FDA-approved drug (Epidiolex), it is therefore illegal to add to food and CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition. While there is an exception for articles that were marketed as a conventional food or dietary supplement before the new drug investigations were authorized (or the new drug was approved), the FDA has asserted that, based on available evidence, the exception does not apply to CBD. As previously mentioned, the FDA takes the position that it is unlawful under the FDCA to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, or to market CBD products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Despite FDA’s stated position, the agency has not, to date, been active in its CBD-related enforcement absent CBD products bearing aggressive therapeutic claims (e.g., claims of treatment of COVID-19, neuropathy, AIDS, diabetes, cancer, etc.). FDA could change its enforcement priorities at any time. The FDA has indicated that it will work towards providing ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market CBD products. In addition, options remain available for the FDA to consider whether there are circumstances in which certain cannabis-derived compounds might be permitted in a food or dietary supplement. Importantly, notwithstanding the FDA’s stated position prohibiting sales of CBD containing-foods and dietary supplements, the FDA has authority to issue a regulation allowing the use of a pharmaceutical ingredient, such as CBD, in a food or dietary supplement, even if such pharmaceutical ingredient was not previously marketed as a food or dietary ingredient prior to the initiation of clinical drug trials. Timing regarding if or when FDA might issue such a regulation is unclear. States have also taken various approaches to the production and sale of hemp-derived food products. Many states have adopted the Uniform State Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which was created in 1984 by the Association of Food and Drug Officials (the “AFDO”), the primary organization for state food and drug officials. The AFDO’s model Uniform Act includes a provision to automatically incorporate changes to the FDCA into state law. However, there is some variation between state Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Acts both because not all states have adopted this provision, and because not all states have adopted the Uniform Act. States that have adopted the Uniform Act generally prohibit the use of CBD in food and dietary supplements due to the FDA’s lack of approval for such uses of the substance, discussed above. For example, Michigan (among other states) prohibits the use of CBD in retail food and beverage products because of the FDA’s stated position. Like FDA, some states, despite having stated positions of the impermissibility of CBD foods and supplements, or any CBD products at all, enforcement is inconsistent, with some state regulators more active than others. Again, these enforcement priorities could change at any time. Although hemp-derived CBD cannot be added or marketed in foods or dietary supplements, certain hemp derived substances, such as hemp seed oil, may be permissible in food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and other products depending on whether the ingredients and finished products comply with the other requirements of the FDCA. For example, a substance that will be added to food is subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless it is generally recognized, among qualified experts, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use (“GRAS”). Pursuant to the FDCA, a food ingredient may be marketed in the US under any of the following three alternative criteria: (i) if it was approved by the FDA or USDA between 1938 and 1958 for the intended use (commonly referred to as a “prior sanction”); (ii) if it is GRAS for its intended use; or (iii) pursuant to a food additive regulation promulgated by the FDA. On December 20, 2018, the FDA issued GRAS approvals for three ingredients that are derived from parts of the cannabis plant that do not contain THC or CBD – hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein, and hemp seed oil. These three types of products can be legally marketed in human foods without food additive approval, provided they comply with all other requirements and do not make unlawful drug claims. It is worth noting that none of these GRAS products contain CBD. The 2018 Farm Bill also contemplates a significant state presence in the regulation of hemp production, as the 2018 Farm Bill empowers states, US territories and Native American tribes to regulate the production and sale of hemp within their respective borders. To regulate commercial hemp production, states, US territories and Native American tribes must submit plans to the USDA setting out the processes associated with how the state, territory or tribe will regulate hemp production, including how 20 it will gather information, test, inspect and dispose of hemp and its related byproducts. The Secretary of the USDA must approve or reject these plans within sixty days of receipt. If a state, territory or tribe chooses not to submit a plan to the USDA, potential producers will be able to apply directly to the USDA for licensing approval. States, territories and tribes may also enact stricter laws than those enacted at the federal level and may ban hemp production and sale within their respective jurisdiction. Once implemented, in jurisdictions with USDA-approved state programs, it will be a violation of state law to cultivate hemp without a registration in compliance with state law, or in the case of a state or territory without a USDA-approved program, it will be a violation of federal law to cultivate hemp without a federally issued license. The 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law on December 20, 2018. Importantly, however, the Industrial Hemp cultivation and research provisions contained in the Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Bill”) will remain in effect pending the USDA’s rulemaking process and certain provisions of the law may not yet be effective. The federal rulemaking process may take more than one year to finalize, and the 2014 Farm Bill will be repealed one year after the USDA establishes regulations governing hemp production in states lacking their own USDA-approved plans. The scope of the 2014 Farm Bill is limited to cultivation that is: (i) for research purposes (inclusive of market research, which multiple federal agencies have confirmed includes commercial sales with a research purpose); (ii) part of an “agricultural pilot program” or other agricultural or academic research; and (iii) permitted by state law. Further, the 2014 Farm Bill defines “Industrial Hemp” as the plant Cannabis sativa L., and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. The USDA published its final rule on January 19, 2021. The USDA’s final rule establishes a federal licensing plan for regulating US hemp producers in states that do not have their own USDA-approved plans. In the absence of a state plan, US hemp producers will be subject to regulation directly by the USDA unless the state prohibits US hemp production. Additionally, the final rule includes requirements for maintaining information on the land where US hemp is produced, testing US hemp for THC levels, disposing of plants with more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry-weight basis and licensing for US hemp producers. The USDA’s final rule requires hemp producers to use a laboratory that is registered with the DEA, although the USDA is delaying enforcement of this requirement until December 31, 2022. The final rule also includes provisions for producers to dispose or remediate violative hemp plants without the use of a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement. State-Level Overview The following section presents an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the hemp industry in Florida, where the Company has an operating presence as of the date of this filing. Florida Florida continues to classify all cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, except medical marijuana grown and sold under the state’s medical marijuana program and, as of July 1, 2019, both hemp and industrial hemp. Florida defines “cannabis” in its criminal code to include, “all parts of any plant of the genus cannabis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant or its seeds or resin.” The term does not include “marijuana,” if manufactured, possessed, sold, purchased, delivered, distributed, or dispensed, in conformance with § 381.986 Florida’s Medical Marijuana Program statutes. This term also does not include “hemp” defined in § 581.217 or “industrial hemp” as defined in § 1004.4473. On May 3, 2019, the Florida legislature passed SB1020, creating Florida’s hemp farming program governed by the Florida Department of Agriculture, legalizing cannabidiol and the sale and distribution of hemp extracts, and removing hemp and industrial hemp from the definition of cannabis under state law so that hemp is no longer a controlled substance in the state of Florida. On June 25, 2019, the bill was signed by the governor and went into on effect July 1, 2019. On April 16, 2020, Florida’s Hemp Plan was approved by USDA. Hemp cultivators may now apply for licensure online with the Florida Department of Agriculture. As part of the application, hemp cultivators must undergo a background check and must submit a Hemp Containment and Transportation Plan, among other requirements. Regulatory Framework in Canada Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Canada The TCI License TCI currently holds a standard cultivation license, standard processing license and license for sale for medical purposes under the Cannabis Act. This license expires on June 25, 2024. Under the TCI License, and subject to further requirements set out in 21 the Cannabis Act, TCI may possess, obtain produce and sell cannabis, including sales of cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles, and oils, in accordance with the applicable Cannabis Regulations, subject to certain terms and conditions, including, without limitation, shipping security requirements, health warning messages, THC concentration limits, proper THC and CBD amount labeling, restriction on medical claims, record keeping requirements and notification requirements for adverse events. The Company obtained an amendment to the TCI License to allow for sales of cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles. Permitted activities related to cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles, like other forms of cannabis, includes strict terms and conditions that a Licensed Producer must comply with. See Appendix A– “ List of Licenses and Permits of TerrAscend Corp. ” Summary of Canadian Regulatory Framework On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations came into force as law with the effect of legalizing the recreational adult-use of cannabis and regulating the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and cannabis derived products (both medical and adult-use) within Canada. The Cannabis Act replaced the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) and the Old International Health Regulations (“IHR”), both of which came into force under the CDSA, which previously permitted access to cannabis for medical purposes for only those Canadians who had been authorized to use cannabis by their health care practitioner. The Cannabis Act provides a licensing and permitting scheme for activities related to cannabis, implemented by regulations made under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Act maintains separate medical access to cannabis, including providing that import and export licenses and permits will only be issued in respect of cannabis for medical or scientific purposes or in respect of industrial hemp. Transitional provisions of the Cannabis Act provide that licenses and permits issued under the former ACMPR and the Narcotics Control Regulations (“NCR”) that were in force immediately before the day on which the Cannabis Act came into force are deemed to continue under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Regulations (the “Regulations”), among other things, outline the rules for the legal cultivation, processing, research, testing, distribution, sale, importation and exportation of cannabis and hemp in Canada, including the various classes of licenses that can be granted, and set standards for cannabis and hemp products. The Regulations include strict specifications for the plain packaging and labelling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed production and processing sites. The Cannabis Act and Regulations were amended on October 17, 2019 to provide for new classes of cannabis, namely edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals, that are permitted to be sold in the medical and adult-use markets as well as to establish new regulatory controls to address the public health and safety risks associated with these new classes of cannabis. These controls include restrictions on product composition and ingredients, THC limits, and new requirements pertaining to promotion, packaging and labelling, good production practices and record keeping. Pursuant to the Cannabis Act, subject to provincial regulations, individuals over the age of 18 are able to purchase fresh cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis oil, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals, edible cannabis and cannabis plants or seeds and are able to legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis or equivalent. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides provincial, territorial and municipal governments the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retailing and distribution, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements of the Cannabis Act such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption, and limiting the ability of households to grow cannabis plants. The Cannabis Regulations establish requirements relating to licenses; security, including clearances; cannabis products; packaging, labelling and promotion, health products and cosmetics containing cannabis and cannabis for medical purposes. Licenses, Permits and Authorizations The Cannabis Regulations establish six classes of licenses: (i) cultivation; (ii) processing; (iii) analytical testing; (iv) sale for medical purposes; (v) research; and (vi) cannabis drug. The Cannabis Regulations also create subclasses for cultivation licenses (standard cultivation, micro-cultivation and nursery) and processing licenses (standard processing and micro-processing). Different licenses and each sub-class therein, carry differing rules and requirements that are intended to be proportional to the public health and safety risks posed by each license category and each sub-class. Licenses issued pursuant to the Cannabis Regulations may be issued for a period of no more than five years and identify the specific activities that the license holder is authorized to conduct. The Cannabis Regulations may also permit cultivation license holders to conduct both indoor and outdoor cultivation of cannabis, once outdoor cultivation is permitted, however no licensed activities can take place in a “dwelling-house” and all activities must take place on the authorized site (except for destruction, antimicrobial treatment and distribution). The implications of the proposal to allow outdoor cultivation are not yet known, but such a development could be significant as it may reduce start-up capital required for new entrants in the cannabis industry. It 22 may also ultimately lower prices as capital expenditure requirements related to growing outside are typically much lower than those associated with indoor growing, which may benefit the Company in its capacity as a buyer. Security Clearances Certain people associated with cannabis licensees, including, but not limited to, directors and officers of a license holder and any significant shareholders of the license holder, the key positions identified by license class (e.g. master grower, quality assurance person, head of security), and any individual or position specified by the Minister pursuant to Subsection 67(2) of the Cannabis Act, must hold a valid security clearance issued by the Minister. Under the Cannabis Regulations, the Minister may refuse to grant security clearances to individuals with associations to organized crime or with past convictions for, or an association with, drug trafficking, corruption or violent offences, among other reasons. Individuals who have histories of nonviolent, lower-risk criminal activity (for example, simple possession of cannabis, or small-scale cultivation of cannabis plants) are not automatically precluded from participating in the legal cannabis industry, and the grant of security clearance to such individuals is at the discretion of the Minister and such applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Cannabis Tracking System and Reporting Under the Cannabis Act, the Minister is authorized to establish and maintain a national cannabis tracking system. The Cannabis Tracking and Licensing System (the “CTLS”), a single-entry-point secure online platform, has since been established to track cannabis throughout the supply chain to help prevent the diversion of cannabis into, and out of, the illegal market. The CTLS applies to: • holders of federally issued licenses for cultivation, processing and sale for medical purposes, which are required to provide information to the Minister; • public provincial and territorial bodies that are authorized to sell cannabis under a provincial and territorial act, which are required to provide information to the Minister; and • private distributors and retailers, which are required to provide data to the public body authorized to sell cannabis or that authorizes sale under provincial and territorial legislation (typically a crown corporation or a provincial ministry). The information required to be reported is extensive. Among other things, a holder of a license for cultivation, a license for processing or a license for sale for medical purposes that authorizes the possession of cannabis must, no later than the fifteenth day of each month, provide the Minister with certain prescribed information in respect of the site specified in the license. In addition, the CTLS web portal enables the submissions of new license applications, requests for amendments and license renewals and applications for security clearances. Cannabis Products Initially, the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations set out certain requirements for the sale of cannabis products at the retail level and initially permitted the sale of dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in “pre-rolled” and capsule form, by authorized license holders. On October 17, 2019, the Federal Government legalized new classes of products; specifically, edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products pursuant to certain amendments to the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations. The previous class, cannabis oil, was subject to a one year transition period to allow for existing cannabis license holders to transition their current products in order to comply with the amended Cannabis Regulations. Consequently, the Cannabis Act was amended with effect on October 17, 2020 to remove “cannabis oil” as a separate cannabis category from Schedule 4 of the Cannabis Act. Edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products, which are now available for sale, are subject to additional regulatory requirements that include supplemental marketing and advertising rules, further restrictions on labelling and packaging, rules relating to ingredients of edible cannabis and cannabis extracts, limits on THC content, and additional manufacturing and good production practice requirements. In addition, the Cannabis Regulations require processing license holders to notify Health Canada at least sixty days prior to the intended release of a new product to the market. Packaging and Labelling The Cannabis Regulations set out strict requirements pertaining to the packaging and labelling of cannabis products. These requirements are intended to promote informed consumer choice and allow for the safe handling and transportation of cannabis, while also reducing the appeal of cannabis to youth and promoting safe consumption. Cannabis package labels must include specific information, including, among other things: (i) product source information, including the class of cannabis and the 23 name, phone number, and email of the cultivator or processor, as applicable; (ii) a mandatory health warning, rotating between Health Canada ’ s list of standard health warnings; (iii) the Health Canada standardized cannabis symbol; and (iv) information specifying THC and CBD content. The Cannabis Regulations require plain packaging for cannabis products including strict limits that apply to the use of colours, images, logos and other brand elements that may prevent or inhibit product differentiation. Advertising and Promotions The Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations contain strict restrictions on the promotion of cannabis products and generally prohibit the promotion of cannabis, cannabis accessories and services related to cannabis, unless the promotional activity is specifically authorized under the Cannabis Act. These prohibitions are intended to protect public health and safety, including protecting the health of young persons by restricting their access to cannabis and preventing the inducement of the use of cannabis, while allowing consumers to have access to information with which they can make informed decisions about the consumption of cannabis. In particular, the Cannabis Act provides for broad restrictions on the promotion, packaging and labelling, display, and sale and distribution of cannabis and cannabis accessories in order to prevent young persons from being exposed to such activities and to prevent the encouragement of consumption of cannabis. As such, the promotion, packaging and labelling, display and sale and distribution of cannabis and cannabis accessories takes place in a highly regulated environment which restricts the ability of license holders to brand and market their products in a manner consistent with other industries which are not subject to such controls. Various provinces and territories have enacted additional restrictions on the promotion of cannabis which are stricter than the federal regulations, including increasing the age restrictions provided for under the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations. Cannabis for Medical Purposes Part 14 of the Cannabis Regulations sets out the regime for medical cannabis following legalization, which is substantively similar to that provided for under the former ACMPR, with adjustments to create consistency with rules for non-medical use, improve patient access, and reduce the risk of abuse within the medical access system. Patients who have the authorization of their healthcare practitioner will continue to have access to medical cannabis, either purchased directly from a Licensed Producer, by registering to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes or designating someone to produce cannabis for them. Under the ACMPR regime, medical cannabis was sold online by Licensed Producers only, which did not change with the enactment of the Cannabis Act. However, after the introduction of the Cannabis Act and the legalization of cannabis for adult-use, users of medical cannabis may now elect to purchase cannabis from retailers of cannabis for adult-use. The Federal Government has stated its intention to review the medical cannabis system five years from the enactment of the Cannabis Act in order to determine whether to implement any further changes to the regulatory framework for medical cannabis. With respect to starting materials for personal production, such as plants or seeds, they must be obtained from Licensed Producers. It is possible that this could significantly reduce the addressable market for the Company’s products and could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. That said, management of the Company believes that many patients may be deterred from opting to proceed with these options since such steps require applying for and obtaining registration from Health Canada to grow cannabis, as well as the up-front costs of obtaining equipment and materials to produce such cannabis. See – “ Competitive Conditions. ” Health Products and Cosmetics Containing Cannabis Health Canada has taken a scientific, evidenced-based approach for the oversight of health products containing cannabis that are approved with health claims, including prescription and non-prescription drugs, natural health products, veterinary drugs and veterinary health products, and medical devices. Prior to the coming into force of the Cannabis Act on October 17, 2018, cannabis was regulated as both a controlled substance under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, as well as a drug under the Food and Drugs Act (“FDA”). Under that legislative framework, activities with cannabis were generally prohibited, unless authorized under certain regulations such as the ACMPR, NCR, IHR and Food and Drug Regulations. When the Cannabis Act came into force, cannabis was removed from the CDSA, and is now subject to restrictions under the new legislative framework while maintaining a partnership with the FDA for regulating health products in a coordinated way. Health products containing cannabis or for use with cannabis will remain subject to a number of requirements under the FDA to ensure appropriate controls for safety, efficacy, and quality, while separate requirements under the Cannabis Act will protect against risks to public health and safety, including diversion to the illegal market. 24 The Cannabis Exemption (Food and Drugs Act) Regulations exempt cannabis from the FDA unless, among other things, therapeutic claims are made in association with such products. For many of these products, such as drugs, natural health products and most classes of medical devices, pre-market approval is required. In addition, when the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations were enacted, the Natural Health Products Regulations under the FDA were amended to effectively prohibit cannabis products from being regulated as a natural health product. Instead, cannabis, if not exempt from the FDA, will be treated as a drug product. With respect to cosmetic products, under the Cannabis Regulations, the use of cannabis and hemp derived ingredients (other than certain hemp seed derivatives containing no more than 10 parts per million THC) in cosmetics, are permitted, subject to the provisions of Health Canada’s Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist and the IHR. Provincial and Territorial Developments While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the Federal Government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis and the sale of medical cannabis, it also provides that the provinces and territories of Canada have authority to regulate certain aspects of adult-use cannabis, such as distribution and sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters. The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented their regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age of 19 years old, except for Alberta, where the minimum age is 18, and Québec, where the minimum age is 21. A summary of the legislative framework in each province and territory is set out below. British Columbia The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in British Columbia is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control and Licensing Act, the Cannabis Distribution Act and the related regulations. The British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch is the province’s wholesale distributor of cannabis and operates retail and online sales. Private retail stores are also permitted and are licensed by the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch. Alberta The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Alberta is primarily governed by the Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Act and the related regulations. The Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission (the “AGLC”) is the sole wholesale distributor of cannabis in the province. Sales of cannabis are permitted through privately run retail stores and online by the AGLC. Saskatchewan The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Saskatchewan is primarily governed by The Cannabis Control (Saskatchewan) Act and the related regulations. Both the wholesale and retail sale of cannabis (both in store and online) is conducted by private companies in Saskatchewan, which is in turn regulated by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority. Manitoba The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Manitoba is primarily governed by the Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis Control Act and the related regulations. Cannabis in the province is distributed by Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries Corporation. Retail and online sales of cannabis are conducted by private retailers under the regulation of the Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis Authority of Manitoba. Ontario The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Ontario is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act, 2017, the Cannabis Licence Act, 2018 and the related regulations. The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation is the wholesale distributor of cannabis and conducts all online sales in the province. 25 Québec The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Quebec is primarily governed by the Cannabis Regulation Act and the related regulations. The Société Québécoise du Cannabis is the exclusive distributor of cannabis in the province and is the sole retail and online vendor. New Brunswick The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in New Brunswick is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act and the related regulations. The distribution and sale of cannabis, both online and in store, is exclusively conducted by the New Brunswick Cannabis Management Corporation. Nova Scotia The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Nova Scotia is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act and the related regulations. Recreational cannabis is distributed and sold at retail locations and online by the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation. Newfoundland and Labrador The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Newfoundland and Labrador is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act and the related regulations. Recreational cannabis is sold through private stores, with the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation (“ NLC ”) conducting online sales and regulating distribution. The NLC also has the option to open public stores in areas that do not attract private retailers. Prince Edward Island The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Prince Edward Island is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act and the related regulations. Cannabis is distributed and sold at retail locations and online by the PEI Cannabis Management Corporation. Yukon The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Yukon is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control and Regulation Act and the related regulations. The Yukon Liquor Corporation is responsible for distributing cannabis in the territory. Sales of cannabis are permitted through privately run retail stores and online by the Yukon Liquor Corporation. The Northwest Territories The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in the Northwest Territories is primarily governed by the Cannabis Products Act and related regulations. The Northwest Territories Liquor Commission is responsible for the distribution and sale of cannabis through existing liquor stores and online sales, with private retail contemplated in the future. Nunavut The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Nunavut is primarily governed by the territorial Cannabis Act. At this time, the Nunavut Liquor and Cannabis Commission has designated two agents to provide cannabis in the territory through online sales but has issued a request for proposals for other potential suppliers. There is no guarantee that the provincial and territorial frameworks supporting the legalization of cannabis for recreational use in Canada will continue on the terms outlined above or at all or will not be amended or supplemented by additional legislation. Compliance In the US, the Company is in compliance with all state laws and the related cannabis licensing framework of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. In Canada, the Company is in compliance with all applicable federal, provincial and territorial laws and regulations, including the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations. There are no current incidences of noncompliance, citations or notices of violations outstanding which may have an impact on the Company’s licenses, business activities or operations in these states. Notwithstanding the foregoing, like all businesses, the Company may from time-to-time experience incidences of noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations in the states in which the Company operates, and such non-compliance may have an impact on the Company’s licenses, business activities or operations in the applicable states. However, the Company takes steps to minimize, disclose and remedy all incidences of non-compliance 26 which may have an impact on the Company ’ s licenses, business activities or operations in all states in which the Company operates.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risks should be carefully considered when deciding whether to make an investment in TerrAscend. Some of the following factors are interrelated and, consequently, investors and readers should treat such risk factors as a whole. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones that could affect TerrAscend, and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to TerrAscend, or that it currently considers not to be material, may also impair the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend and/or the value of its securities. If any of the following risks or other risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend business, financial condition and results of operations and/or the value of TerrAscend’s securities. There is no assurance that any risk management steps taken by TerrAscend will avoid future loss due to the occurrence of the risks described below, or other unforeseen risks. Regulatory and Legal Risks to the Company’s Business Due to the Nature of the Industry There is a substantial risk of regulatory or political change with respect to cannabis, which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business. In the US, the operations of TerrAscend and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of laws, including, among other things, state and local regulations and guidelines relating to the cultivation, manufacture, management, transportation, distribution, sale, storage and disposal of cannabis. Changes to such laws, regulations and guidelines due to matters beyond the control of TerrAscend may cause adverse effects to TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and result of operations. Local, state and federal laws and regulations governing cannabis for medicinal and recreational purposes are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require TerrAscend to incur substantial costs associated with bringing TerrAscendʼs operations into compliance. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt TerrAscendʼs operations and result in a material adverse effect on its financial performance. It is beyond TerrAscendʼs scope to predict the nature of any future change to the existing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations or applications, nor can TerrAscend determine what effect such changes, when and if promulgated, could have on TerrAscendʼs business. The Cannabis Act came into force in Canada on October 17, 2018 along with various related regulations. The cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of cannabis, among other things, remains subject to extensive regulatory oversight under the Cannabis Act. It is possible that these statutory requirements, including any new regulations that are subsequently issued, could significantly and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. While the foregoing activities in respect of cannabis are under the regulatory oversight of the Government of Canada, the distribution of recreational use cannabis is the responsibility of the respective provincial and territorial governments. These jurisdictions have chosen varying retail frameworks with private, public and hybrid models being implemented. There is no guarantee that provincial and territorial legislation regulating the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes will be continued according to their current terms, that they will not be materially amended or that such regimes will create the growth opportunities that TerrAscend currently anticipates. In addition, government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the cannabis industry in Canada, the US or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public’s perception of medical or recreational cannabis in Canada, the US or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, a shift could cause state and local jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical or recreational cannabis, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which TerrAscend could expand. Any inability to fully implement 27 TerrAscendʼs expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with regulations regarding cannabis is difficult, because the regulation of cannabis is uncertain and frequently changes. The Company’s failure to comply with applicable laws regarding cannabis may adversely affect the Company’s business. Achievement of TerrAscendʼs business objectives is contingent, in part, upon compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by governmental authorities and obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the sale of its products. TerrAscend cannot predict the impact of the compliance regime, the applicable regulatory bodies in the US and Canada are implementing that effect the business of TerrAscend. Similarly, TerrAscend cannot predict the time required to secure all appropriate regulatory approvals for its products, or the extent of testing and documentation that may be required by governmental authorities. The impact of governmental compliance regimes, any delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. TerrAscend will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions on TerrAscendʼs operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to TerrAscendʼs operations, result in increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. The cannabis industry is subject to extensive controls and regulations, which may significantly affect the financial condition of market participants. The marketability of any product may be affected by numerous factors that are beyond the control of TerrAscend and which cannot be predicted, such as changes to government regulations, including those relating to taxes and other government levies which may be imposed. Changes in government levies, including taxes, could reduce TerrAscendʼs earnings and could make future capital investments or TerrAscendʼs operations uneconomic. The industry is also subject to numerous legal challenges, which may significantly affect the financial condition of market participants and which cannot be reliably predicted. TerrAscend’s business relies heavily on its ability to obtain and maintain required licenses, and failure to do so may adversely affect TerrAscend’s business. TerrAscendʼs ability to grow, store and sell medical and adult-use cannabis and cannabis oil in certain US states and Canada is dependent on TerrAscend maintaining licenses with applicable regulators for both oil and dried cannabis production and the sale of dried cannabis. Failure to comply with the requirements of its licenses or any failure to maintain its licenses would have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and operating results of TerrAscend. TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, as applicable, will apply for, as the need arises, all necessary licenses and permits to carry on the activities it expects to conduct in the future. However, the ability of TerrAscend or its subsidiaries to obtain, maintain or renew any such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to changes in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable authorities or other governmental agencies in foreign jurisdictions. In certain states, the cannabis laws and regulations limit, not only the number of cannabis licenses issued, but also the number of cannabis licenses that one person may own. TerrAscend believes that, where such restrictions apply, it may still capture significant share of revenue in the market through wholesale sales, exclusive marketing relations, provision of management or support services, franchising and similar arrangement with other operators. Nevertheless, such limitations on the acquisition of ownership of additional licenses within certain states or enforcement by regulators in certain states against such services arrangements may limit TerrAscendʼs ability to grow organically or to increase its market share in such states. As a cannabis business, TerrAscend is subject to unfavorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. Tax risk is the risk of changes in the tax environment that would have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, results of operations, and financial condition. Currently, state licensed marijuana businesses are assessed a comparatively high effective federal tax rate due to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which prohibits businesses from deducting certain expenses associated with trafficking controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the CSA). The IRS has invoked Section 280E in tax audits against various cannabis businesses in the US that are permitted under applicable state laws. Although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of certain expenses, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to 28 be deducted. While there are currently several pending cases before various administrative and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E favorable to cannabis businesses. Given these facts, the impact of any such challenge cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be significant to the financial condition and/or the overall operations of TerrAscend. If the Company’s tax positions were to be challenged by federal, state, local or foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company may not be wholly successful in defending its tax filing positions. TerrAscend records reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on its assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining the Company’s tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If the Company’s tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts, or the Company may be required to reduce the carrying amount of its net deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Cannabis remains illegal under US federal law, and enforcement of cannabis laws could change. TerrAscend may be subject to action by the US federal government due to its involvement with cannabis, and such action could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. While some states in the US have authorized the use and sale of cannabis in some form, it remains illegal under US federal law. On January 4, 2018, then-US Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum to US Attorneys which rescinded previous guidance from the US Department of Justice specific to cannabis enforcement in the US, including the Cole Memorandum, which stated that the US Department of Justice would not prioritize the prosecution of cannabis-related violations of US federal law in jurisdictions that had enacted laws legalizing medical cannabis in some form and had implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems. With the Cole Memorandum rescinded, US federal prosecutors have greater discretion in determining whether to prosecute medical cannabis-related violations of US federal law; there was never such a policy statement in relation to US state and territories with adult use cannabis programs. Because TerrAscend engages in cannabis-related activities in the US, an increase in federal enforcement efforts with respect to current US federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause financial damage to TerrAscend. In addition, TerrAscend is at risk of being prosecuted under US federal law and having its assets seized. TerrAscendʼs exposure to US cannabis related activities are as follows: At December 31, 2021 At December 31, 2020 Current assets $ 82,328 $ 52,968 Non-current assets 407,675 288,063 Current liabilities 61,255 81,494 Non-current liabilities 164,977 149,452 At December 31, 2021 At December 31, 2020 At December 31, 2019 Revenue, net $ 190,847 $ 125,207 $ 26,684 Gross profit (loss) 110,783 85,520 10,250 Income (loss) from operations 26,503 38,702 (6,976 ) Net loss attributable to controlling interest (2,506 ) (5,582 ) (114,674 ) Violations of any US federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the US federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities, civil forfeiture or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for TerrAscend to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. 29 Unlike in Canada which has federal legislation uniformly governing the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act, investors are cautioned that in the US, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a controlled substance under the CSA in the US and as such, is in violation of federal law in the US. Further, there can be no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. It is also important to note that local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the distribution of cannabis in a manner that will make it extremely difficult or impossible to transact business in the cannabis industry. As stated above, Congress has passed appropriations bills each of the last several years, since 2014, to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. Most recently, on September 30, 2021 and December 3, 2021, President Biden signed short-term continuing resolutions to extend current appropriations, most recently through February 18, 2022. The continuing resolution contains, among other things, the RBA, which prevents the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state medical cannabis laws. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has construed these appropriations bills to prevent the federal government from prosecuting individuals when those individuals comply with state medical cannabis laws, and has vacated numerous convictions and sent the cases back to the trial courts for further determination. However, because this conduct continues to violate federal law, American courts have observed that should Congress at any time choose to appropriate funds to fully prosecute the CSA, any individual or business—even those that have fully complied with state law—could be prosecuted for violations of federal law. If Congress restores funding, for example by declining to include the RBA in a budget resolution, or by failing to pass necessary budget legislation and causing another government shutdown, the government will have the authority to prosecute individuals for violations of the law before it lacked funding under the five-year statute of limitations applicable to non-capital CSA violations. Additionally, it is important to note that the appropriations protections only apply to medical cannabis operations and provide no protection against businesses operating in compliance with a state’s recreational cannabis laws. The Department of Justice or a federal prosecutor could allege that TerrAscend and the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”) and, potentially its shareholders, “aided and abetted” violations of federal law by providing finances and services to its operating subsidiaries. Under these circumstances, it is possible that a federal prosecutor would seek to seize the assets of TerrAscend and to recover the “illicit profits” previously distributed to shareholders resulting from any of the foregoing financing or services. In these circumstances, TerrAscend’s operations could cease, TerrAscend securityholders may lose their entire investment and directors, officers and/or TerrAscend shareholders may be left to defend any criminal charges against them at their own expense and, if convicted, be sent to federal prison. Violations of any federal laws could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its holding (directly or indirectly) of cannabis licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on any securities exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its listed securities. An investor’s contribution to and involvement in TerrAscend’s activities may result in federal civil and/or criminal prosecution, including forfeiture of his, her or its entire investment. Although the 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, generally removes hemp from the controlled substances list under the CSA, it does not legalize CBD generally. In particular, the 2018 Farm Bill preserves the FDAʼs authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. Pursuant to a statement released December 20, 2018, Frequently Asked Questions on the FDAʼs website, and numerous public statements, the FDA has taken the position that all CBD is a drug ingredient and therefore illegal to add to food or health products without its approval or further action by the FDA. The FDA considers products containing CBD or other cannabis-derived compounds the same as any other FDA-regulated products and takes the position that they are subject to the same authorities and requirements as similarly regulated products, including but not limited to required approvals for food ingredients and dietary supplements based on safety standards. Importantly, the FDA has taken the position that it is unlawful under the FDCA to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, or to market CBD products as, or in, food or dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp derived. The FDA has however indicated that it will work towards providing ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market CBD products. Further, many state criminal laws and food and drug laws prohibit or restrict the production and/or sale of hemp-derived CBD products. TerrAscendʼs US hemp operations will be subject to FDA oversight. There is no guarantee that TerrAscend will be able to obtain necessary approval from regulatory authorities for its products in the US. 30 TerrAscendʼs activities and operations in the US are, and will continue to be, subject to evolving regulation by governmental authorities. The approach to the enforcement of cannabis laws may be subject to change or may not proceed as previously outlined. The USDA will promulgate additional rules governing the production of hemp in the US, with many states in the process of amending state laws to regulate hemp production and the sale of hemp-derived products within their borders. In addition, the FDA is expected to make determinations as to how CBD products will be regulated and is expected to issue a substantial change in its regulation of dietary supplements generally. Accordingly, there are significant changes in both federal and state law that may materially impact TerrAscendʼs operations. The Company’s business is subject to applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations and have restricted access to capital markets, banking and other financial services, which may adversely affect TerrAscend’s business. Since the use of cannabis is currently illegal under US federal law, and in light of considerations related to money laundering and other federal financial crime related to cannabis in the US banking industry, US banks have been reluctant to accept or deposit funds from businesses involved with the cannabis industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept its business. Likewise, cannabis businesses have limited access, if any, to credit card processing services. As a result, cannabis businesses in the US are largely cash-based. This complicates the implementation of financial controls and increases security issues. While TerrAscend is not able to obtain financing in the US from banks or other US federally regulated entities, TerrAscend has been able to access equity financing through private markets in both the US and Canada. Commercial banks, private equity firms, and venture capital firms have approached the cannabis industry cautiously to date. However, there are increasing numbers of high-net-worth individuals and family offices that have made meaningful investments in companies and businesses similar to TerrAscend. Although there has been an increase in the amount of private funding available over the last several years to companies that are active in the cannabis industry in North America, there is neither a broad nor deep pool of institutional capital that is available to cannabis license holders and license applicants. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if raised privately, will be available to TerrAscend when needed or on terms which are acceptable to TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs inability to raise financing to fund its capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit its growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. Under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act, financial transactions in the US involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution. The FinCEN division of the US Department of Treasury has provided guidance for how financial institutions can provide services to the cannabis-related businesses consistent with the obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Previously, DOJ directed its federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memorandum when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon cannabis-related activity. In January 2018, the DOJ revoked the Cole Memorandum and related memorandum. While the impact remains unclear, the revocation has created uncertainty. For instance, federal prosecutors may increase enforcement activities against institutions or individuals who are engaged in financial transactions related to cannabis activities, or there may be a negative impact to the continuation of financial services in the US with regard to cannabis-related activities. Consequently, businesses involved in the regulated medical-use cannabis industry may experience difficulties establishing banking relationships, and such difficulties may increase over time. If TerrAscend were to experience any inability to access financial services in the US, including its current bank accounts, this would have a direct impact on the ability for TerrAscend to operate its businesses. This impact would increase TerrAscendʼs operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical, and security challenges that could impede its inability to implement its business plans. The US federal prohibitions on the sale of marijuana may result in TerrAscend and its partners being restricted from accessing the US banking system and they may be unable to deposit funds in federally insured and licensed banking institutions. Banking restrictions could be imposed due to TerrAscendʼs banking institutions not accepting payments and deposits. TerrAscend is at risk that any bank accounts it has could be closed at any time. Such risks increase costs to TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs activities in the US, and any proceeds thereof, may be considered proceeds of crime due to the fact that cannabis remains federally illegal in the US. This may restrict the ability of TerrAscend to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or subsequently repatriate such funds back to Canada. Furthermore, while TerrAscend has no current intention to declare or pay dividends on its Common Shares in the foreseeable future, TerrAscend may decide or be required to suspend declaring or paying dividends without advance notice and for an indefinite period of time. The guidance provided in the FinCEN Memorandum as described above may change depended on the position of the US government administration at any given time and is subject to revision or retraction in the future, which may restrict TerrAscendʼs access to banking services. 31 TerrAscend operates in a highly regulated sector and may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where the Company carries on business, which could negatively affect TerrAscend’s business. Given the complexity of the US regulation of the cannabis industry, certain requirements may prove to be excessively onerous or otherwise impractical for TerrAscend to comply with. This may result in the exclusion of certain business opportunities from the list of possible transactions that TerrAscend would otherwise consider. Further, US laws and regulations at the local, state, and federal levels which apply to the cannabis industry are continually changing, and it is difficult to determine if future changes could detrimentally affect the operations of TerrAscend. Given the broad scope of cannabis laws and regulations, these are subject to evolving interpretations. This continued evolution could require TerrAscend to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt TerrAscendʼs businesses and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. TerrAscendʼs continued compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by government authorities and obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the sale of its products, including maintain and renewing all applicable licenses, is crucial to the successful execution of TerrAscendʼs strategies. The commercial cannabis industry is an emerging industry in the US, and TerrAscend cannot forecast the impact of the compliance regime to which they will be subject. Similarly, TerrAscend cannot predict its ability to secure all appropriate regulatory approvals for any of its products, or the extent of testing or related documentation that may be required by governmental authorities. Delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and operating results of TerrAscend. Without limiting the foregoing, TerrAscendʼs failure to comply with the requirements of any underlying licenses or any failure to maintain any underlying licenses would have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, and operating results. It is uncertain whether any required licenses for the operation of TerrAscendʼs business will be extended or renewed in a timely manner, if at all, or that if they are extended or renewed, that the licenses will be extended or renewed on the same or similar terms. The Company’s products may be subject to product recalls or returns, which may result in expense, legal proceedings, regulatory action, loss of sales and reputation, and management attention. TerrAscendʼs products may be subject to recall or return for a variety of reasons, including product defects such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of TerrAscendʼs products are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, TerrAscend could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection therewith. TerrAscend may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Although TerrAscend has detailed procedures in place for testing its products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of the products produced by TerrAscend were subject to recall, the image of that product and TerrAscend could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for TerrAscendʼs products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of TerrAscendʼs operations by Health Canada and other regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses. TerrAscend faces an inherent risk of product liability claims and other consumer protection claims as a manufacturer, processor and producer of products that are meant to be ingested by people, and dealing with such claims could cause the Company to incur substantial expenses and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. As a manufacturer of products designed to be ingested by humans, TerrAscend faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if its products are alleged to have caused significant loss or injury. In addition, the manufacturing and sale of cannabis and other products involve the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of cannabis products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur. TerrAscend may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that the products produced by TerrAscend caused injury or illness, include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against TerrAscend could result in increased costs, could adversely affect TerrAscendʼs reputation with its clients and consumers generally, and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. 32 TerrAscendʼs products may be considered misbranded or adulterated, or otherwise unlawful under federal and state food and drug laws and could subject TerrAscend to local, federal, or state enforcement or private litigation. Some states permit advertising, labeling laws, false and deceptive trade practices, and other consumer-protection laws to be enforced by state attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by TerrAscend. Private litigation may also seek relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by TerrAscend in any of the markets in which it operates. Any actions against TerrAscend by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may be subject to constraints on and differences in marketing its products under varying regulatory restrictions. The development of TerrAscendʼs business and results of operations may be hindered by applicable regulatory restrictions on sales and marketing activities. For example, the regulatory environment in Canada limits TerrAscendʼs ability to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries. If TerrAscend is unable to effectively market its products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for TerrAscendʼs products, TerrAscendʼs sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. The Company may be subject to heightened scrutiny by Canadian regulatory authorities, which could negatively affect its business. TerrAscendʼs future investments, joint ventures and operations in the US may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, TerrAscend may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not in turn lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on TerrAscendʼs ability to invest in the US or any other jurisdiction, in addition to those described herein. Although a memorandum of understanding signed by the Canadian Depository for Securities (“CDS”) and the Canadian recognized exchanges (Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., the CSE, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange) dated February 8, 2018, confirms that CDS relies on the exchanges to review the conduct of listed issuers, and therefore there is currently no CDS ban on the clearing of securities of issuers with cannabis-related activities in the US, there can be no guarantee that this approach to regulation will continue in the future. If such a ban were to be implemented, it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of Common Shares to make and settle trades. In particular, Common Shares would become highly illiquid as and until an alternative was implemented, investors would have no ability to affect a trade of Common Shares through the facilities of a stock exchange. The Company’s investors and directors, officers and employees who are not US citizens may be denied entry into the US, which may negatively affect the Company’s business. Because cannabis remains illegal under US federal law, those employed at or investing in legal and licensed Canadian cannabis companies could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the US for their business associations with US cannabis businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of the US Customs and Border Protection officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a foreign national. The Government of Canada has started warning travelers on its website that previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by US federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the US. Business or financial involvement in the legal cannabis industry in Canada or in the US could also be reason enough for US border guards to deny entry . Because the Company’s contracts involve cannabis and related activities, which are not legal under US federal law, the Company may face difficulties in enforcing its contracts. It is a fundamental principle of law that a contract will not be enforced if it involves a violation of law or public policy. Because cannabis remains illegal at a federal level, judges may refuse to enforce contracts in connection with activities that violate US federal law, even if there is no violation of state law. There remains doubt and uncertainty that TerrAscend will be able to legally enforce contracts it enters into if necessary. TerrAscend cannot be assured that it will have a remedy for breach of contract, the lack of which may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, revenues, operating results, financial condition or prospects. 33 TerrAscend may encounter increasingly strict environmental health and safety regulations in connection with its operations, which may harm the Company’s business. TerrAscendʼs operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions and discharges to water, air and land, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, and employee health and safety. Changes in environmental, employee health and safety or other laws, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to TerrAscendʼs operations or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. TerrAscend faces risks related to the loss of foreign private issuer status and becoming a US reporting company. The Company has determined that it no longer meets the definition of a foreign private issuer (“FPI”) as at the applicable reference date. As a public issuer, the Company is currently subject to the reporting requirements and rules and regulations under the applicable Canadian securities laws and rules of any stock exchange on which the Company’s securities may be listed from time to time. Effective January 1, 2022, due to the loss of FPI status, the Company became subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Additional or new regulatory requirements may be adopted in the future. The loss of FPI status may have adverse consequences on the Company’s ability to issue its securities to acquire companies and its ability to raise capital in private placements or prospectus offerings. In addition, the requirements of existing and potential future rules and regulations will increase the Company’s legal, audit, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on the Company’s personnel, systems and resources, including the transition of the Company’s financial reporting from IFRS to US GAAP, which could adversely affect TerrAscend’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, should the Company seek to list on a securities exchange in the US, the loss of FPI status may increase the cost and time required for such a listing. Risks Related to TerrAscend’s Business, Operations and Industry The Company’s indebtedness may adversely affect TerrAscend’s business. The Company’s failure to comply with applicable covenants could trigger events that may materially adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s indebtedness may adversely affect the Company’s business. The instruments governing the Company’s indebtedness include obligations and covenants that limit the Company’s discretion with respect to certain business matters and require the Company to satisfy certain financial requirements. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to comply with such obligations and covenants and any failure to comply could result in a default, which, if not amended, cured or waived, could permit acceleration of the relevant indebtedness and the exercise of other remedies available to the lenders. In such event, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain any amendment, cure, waiver or other relief on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain relief from an event of the relevant indebtedness may be accelerated and the related collateral may be foreclosed upon, in addition such circumstances may result in the cross-default or cross-acceleration to other debt, any of which would materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The Company may require substantial additional financing to operate its business and it may face difficulties acquiring additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. The building and operation of TerrAscendʼs business, including its facilities, are capital intensive. In order to execute the anticipated growth strategy, TerrAscend may require additional equity and/or debt financing to support on-going operations, to undertake capital expenditures or to undertake acquisitions or other business combination transactions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to TerrAscend when needed or on terms which are acceptable. TerrAscendʼs inability to raise financing to support on-going operations or to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit TerrAscendʼs growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. TerrAscend may require additional financing to fund its operations to the point where it is generating positive cash flows. Any debt financing secured in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for TerrAscend to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. 34 TerrAscend faces intense competition as a relatively new entrant in the cannabis industry, and its business could be adversely affected by other businesses in a better competitive position. The introduction of an adult-use model for cannabis production and distribution may impact the medical cannabis market. The impact of this potential development may be negative for TerrAscend and could result in increased levels of competition in its existing medical market and/or the entry of new competitors in the overall cannabis market in which TerrAscend operates. There is potential that TerrAscend will face intense competition from other companies, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than TerrAscend. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. If the number of users of medical cannabis in North America increases, the demand for products will increase and TerrAscend expects that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. To remain competitive, TerrAscend will require a continued high level of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. TerrAscend may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. The cannabis industry and market are relatively new, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as expected. TerrAscend is operating its business in a relatively new industry and market. Competitive conditions, consumer preferences, patient requirements and spending patterns in this new industry and market are relatively unknown and may have unique circumstances that differ from existing industries and markets. Accordingly, there are no assurances that this industry and market will continue to exist or grow as currently estimated or anticipated, or function and evolve in a manner consistent with management’s expectations and assumptions. Any event or circumstance that affects the medical cannabis industry and market could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscendʼs success in North America is dependent on the market building out direct to consumer channels including but not limited to retail outlets. There are many factors which could impact TerrAscendʼs ability to gain market share and distribute its products, including but not limited to the continued growth and expansion of retail outlets in the North American market which may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, operating results and financial condition. TerrAscendʼs ability to continue to grow, process, store and sell medical cannabis and participate in the adult-use cannabis markets is dependent on the maintenance and validity of TerrAscendʼs licenses from regulatory authorities. The cannabis industry and markets are relatively new in North America and in other jurisdictions, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as anticipated or TerrAscend may ultimately be unable to succeed in this industry and market. The Company has historically had negative cash flow from operating activities, and continued losses could have a material negative effect on the Company’s business and prospects. TerrAscend started sales in April 2018 and historically has had negative cash flow from operating activities. TerrAscend may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and may continue to incur significant losses in the future. In addition, TerrAscend expects to continue to increase operating expenses as it implements initiatives to continue to grow its business. If TerrAscendʼs sales do not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, TerrAscend will not be profitable. Continued losses may have the following consequences: ● increasing TerrAscendʼs vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; ● limiting TerrAscendʼs ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, operating costs and other general corporate requirements; and ● limiting TerrAscendʼs flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry. 35 Demand for the Company’s products is difficult to forecast due to limited and unreliable market data. As a result of recent and ongoing regulatory and policy changes in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry, the market data available is limited and unreliable. Federal and state laws prevent widespread participation and hinder market research. Therefore, TerrAscend must rely largely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts are not generally obtainable from other sources at this early stage of the industry. Market research and projections by TerrAscend of estimated total retail sales, demographics, demand, and similar consumer research are based on assumptions from limited and unreliable market data, and generally represent the personal opinions of TerrAscendʼs management team as of the date of this Form 10-K. A failure in the demand for its products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of TerrAscend. TerrAscend’s inability to attract and retain key personnel could materially adversely affect its business. The success of TerrAscend is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith of its senior management, which are key personnel. Moreover, TerrAscendʼs future success depends on its continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and TerrAscend may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. The loss of the services of such key personnel, or an inability to attract other suitably qualified persons when needed, could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs ability to execute on its business plan and strategy, and TerrAscend may be unable to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of such key personnel these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees. There is no assurance that any of TerrAscendʼs existing personnel who presently or may in the future require a security clearance will be able to obtain or renew such clearances or that new personnel who require a security clearance will be able to obtain one. A failure by such key personnel to maintain or renew their security clearance would result in a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any key personnel leave TerrAscend, and TerrAscend is unable to find a suitable replacement that has a security clearance in a timely manner, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may face unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, efficacy and quality of its cannabis products. TerrAscend believes the cannabis industry is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the cannabis distributed to such consumers. Consumer perception of TerrAscendʼs products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of medical cannabis products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the medical cannabis market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for TerrAscendʼs products and the business, results of operations, financial condition of TerrAscend. In particular, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of medical cannabis in general, or TerrAscendʼs products specifically, or associating the consumption of medical cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could have such a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers’ failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed. For instance, the vape crisis that began in the summer of 2019 was ultimately linked to cutting agents almost exclusively found in the illicit market. Regardless, several states moved to ban the sale of vape products in legal markets, severely impacting entire revenue streams. Although TerrAscend believes that it takes care in protecting its image and reputation, TerrAscend does not ultimately have direct control over how it is perceived by others. Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and an impediment to TerrAscendʼs overall ability to advance its business, thereby having a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. The Company faces reputational risks, which may negatively impact its business. Damage to TerrAscendʼs reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, and could include any negative publicity, whether true or not. The increased usage of social media and other web-based tools used to 36 generate, publish, and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share opinions and views in regards to TerrAscend and its activities, whether true or not. Although TerrAscend believes that it operates in a manner that is respectful to all shareholders and that it takes care in protecting its image and reputation, TerrAscend does not ultimately have direct control over how it is perceived by others. Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations, and an impediment to TerrAscendʼs overall ability to advance its projects, thereby having a material adverse impact on financial performance, financial condition, cash flows, and growth prospects. Further, the parties with which TerrAscend does business may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result of TerrAscendʼs cannabis business activities. Failure to establish or maintain business relationships could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. The Company is dependent on suppliers and key inputs for the cultivation, extraction and production of cannabis products. The ability of TerrAscend to compete and grow will be dependent on it having access, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, to equipment, parts and components. No assurances can be given that TerrAscend will be successful in maintaining its required supply of equipment, parts and components. It is also possible that the final costs of the major equipment contemplated by TerrAscendʼs capital expenditure plans may be significantly greater than anticipated by TerrAscendʼs management and may be greater than funds available to TerrAscend, in which circumstance TerrAscend may curtail, or extend the timeframes for completing, its capital expenditure plans. This could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. The cannabis business is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other local utilities. Any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs could materially impact the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. In addition, any restrictions on the ability to secure required supplies or utility services or to do so on commercially acceptable terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business, financial condition and operating results. Some of these inputs may only be available from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. If a sole source supplier was to go out of business, TerrAscend might be unable to find a replacement for such source in a timely manner or at all. If a sole source supplier were to be acquired by a competitor, that competitor may elect not to sell to TerrAscend in the future. Any inability to secure required supplies and services or to do so on appropriate terms and/or agreeable terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs business is subject to the risks inherent in agricultural operations. TerrAscendʼs business involves the cultivation of the cannabis plant. The cultivation of this plant is subject to agricultural risks related to insects, plant diseases, unstable growing conditions, water and electricity availability and cost, and force majeure events. Although TerrAscend cultivates its cannabis plants in indoor, climate controlled rooms staffed by trained personnel and in the future plans to cultivate cannabis plants in greenhouses, there can be no assurance that agricultural risks will not have a material adverse effect on the cultivation of its cannabis. TerrAscend may in the future cultivate cannabis plants outdoors, which would also subject it to related agricultural risks. The Company may be adversely impacted by rising or volatile energy costs. TerrAscendʼs cannabis growing and manufacturing operations consume considerable energy, which make TerrAscend vulnerable to rising energy costs. Accordingly, rising or volatile energy costs may adversely impact the business of TerrAscend and its ability to operate profitably. TerrAscendʼs intellectual property may be difficult to protect, and failure to do so may negatively impact its business. The ownership and protection of trademarks, patents, trade secrets and intellectual property rights are significant aspects of TerrAscendʼs future success. TerrAscend has no patented technology or trademarked business methods at this time, nor has it registered any patents. TerrAscend has filed trademark applications in the US and Canada. The Company will continue to seek trademark protection in the US and Canada. TerrAscend’s ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada, including the US, where registered federal trademark protection is currently unavailable for trademarks covering marijuana-related products and services that are illegal under the CSA. Accordingly, TerrAscend’s ability to obtain intellectual property rights or enforce intellectual property rights against third party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain countries. The US Patent and Trademark Office released a 37 policy on May 2, 2019 that clarifies that applications for trademarks for products that meet the definition of hemp could be accepted for registration, with certain exceptions. Even if TerrAscend moves to protect its technology with trademarks, patents, copyrights or by other means, TerrAscend is not assured that competitors will not develop similar technology, business methods or that TerrAscend will be able to exercise its legal rights. Other countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same standards as does the US or Canada. Actions taken to protect or preserve intellectual property rights may require significant financial and other resources which may have a significant impact on TerrAscendʼs ability to successfully grow the business. In addition, other parties may claim that TerrAscendʼs products infringe on their proprietary and perhaps patent protected rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in TerrAscendʼs expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, legal fees, result in injunctions, temporary restraining orders and/or require the payment of damages. The Company and investors may have difficulty enforcing their legal rights. In the event of a dispute arising from TerrAscendʼs US operations, TerrAscend may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdictions of courts in Canada. Similarly, to the extent that TerrAscendʼs assets are located outside of Canada, investors may have difficulty collecting from TerrAscend any judgments obtained in the Canadian courts and predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities provisions. TerrAscend may also be hindered or prevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a governmental entity or instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. TerrAscend faces physical security risks, as well as risks related to its information technology systems, potential cyber-attacks, and privacy breaches. If there was a breach in security systems and TerrAscend becomes victim to a robbery or theft, the loss of cannabis plants, cannabis oils, cannabis flowers and cultivation and processing equipment or if there was a failure of information systems or a component of information systems, it could, depending on the nature of any such breach or failure, adversely impact TerrAscendʼs reputation, business continuity and results of operations. A security breach at one of TerrAscendʼs facilities could expose TerrAscend to additional liability and to potentially costly litigation, increase expenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of these breaches and may deter potential customers from choosing TerrAscendʼs products. Given the nature of TerrAscendʼs products and its lack of legal availability outside of channels approved by the government of the US, as well as the concentration of inventory in its facilities, there remains a risk of shrinkage as well as theft. TerrAscend also collects and stores personal information about its patients and is responsible for protecting that information from privacy breaches. A privacy breach may occur through procedural or process failure, information technology malfunction, or deliberate unauthorized intrusions. Furthermore, Internet websites are visible by people everywhere, not just in jurisdictions where the activities described therein are considered legal. As a result, to the extent that TerrAscend sells services or products via web-based links targeting only jurisdictions in which such sales or services are compliant with state law, TerrAscend may face legal action in other jurisdictions which are not the intended object of any of TerrAscendʼs marketing efforts for engaging in any web-based activity that results in sales into such jurisdictions deemed illegal under applicable laws. TerrAscend has entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology (or “IT”) services in connection with its operations. TerrAscendʼs operations depend, in part, on how well it and its suppliers protect networks, equipment, IT systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism and theft. TerrAscendʼs operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other events could result in information system failures, delays and/or increase in capital expenses. The failure of information systems or a component of information systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact TerrAscendʼs reputation and results of operations. Theft of data for competitive purposes is an ongoing risk whether perpetrated via employee collusion or negligence or through deliberate cyber-attack. Any such theft or privacy breach would have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there are a number of federal, state, and provincial laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. If TerrAscend was found to be in violation of the applicable laws protecting the confidentiality of patient 38 health information, it could be subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties, which could increase its liabilities, harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. TerrAscend faces exposure to fraudulent or illegal activity by employees, contractors and consultants, which may subject the Company to investigations or other actions. TerrAscend is exposed to the risk that its employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to TerrAscend that violates: (i) government regulations; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal and provincial healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It may not always be possible for TerrAscend to identify and deter misconduct by its employees and other third parties, and the precautions taken by TerrAscend to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting TerrAscend from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against TerrAscend, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on TerrAscendʼs business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of TerrAscendʼs operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Directors and officers of the Company have faced, and may in the future face, conflicts of interests regarding the business strategy of the Company. Certain of the directors and officers of TerrAscend are also directors and officers of other companies or are engaged and will continue to be engaged in activities that may put them in conflict with the business strategy of TerrAscend. Consequently, there exists the possibility for such directors and officers to be in a position of conflict. In particular, TerrAscend may also become involved in other transactions which conflict with the interests of its directors and officers, who may from time to time deal with persons, firms, institutions or companies with which TerrAscend may be dealing, or which may be seeking investments similar to those desired by it. All decisions to be made by directors and officers of TerrAscend are required to be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of TerrAscend. In addition, the directors and officers are required to declare their interests in, and such directors are required to refrain from voting on, any matter in which they may have a material conflict of interest. The Company’s internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and the Company’s independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company will incur expenses and, to a lesser extent, diversion of Company management’s time in its efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause TerrAscend to fail to meet its reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by the Company conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm when required, may reveal deficiencies in TerrAscend’s internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retrospective changes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of the Company’s Common Shares. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an impact on the Company’s business and financial results. On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic known as COVID-19. The impacts on global commerce have been far reaching. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an immaterial impact on TerrAscendʼs products and supply chains. The production and sale of cannabis have been recognized as essential services across the US and Canada and TerrAscend has not experienced production delays or prolonged retail closures to date as a result. Due to the continued uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, it is not possible to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on TerrAscendʼs business, financial position and operating results in the future. In addition, it is possible that estimates in 39 TerrAscendʼs financial statements will change in the near term as a result of COVID-19 and the effect of any such changes could be material, which could result in, among other things, impairment of long-lived assets including intangibles and goodwill. An impairment test was performed as of December 31, 2020 for TerrAscendʼs goodwill and intangible assets. Management is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business. As at December 31, 2021 management had not observed any material impairments of TerrAscendʼs assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of the Company’s products is complex and requires significant investment. Failure to develop new technologies and products could adversely affect the Company’s business. The introduction of new products embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes, and the emergence of new industry standards may render TerrAscendʼs products obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The process of developing TerrAscendʼs products is complex and requires significant continuing costs, development efforts and third-party commitments. TerrAscendʼs failure to develop new technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of TerrAscend. TerrAscend may be unable to anticipate changes in its potential customer requirements that could make TerrAscendʼs existing technology obsolete. The development of TerrAscendʼs proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. TerrAscend may not be successful in using its new technologies or exploiting its niche markets effectively or adapting its businesses to evolving customer or medical requirements or preferences or emerging industry standards. Risks Related to the Company’s Investment and Acquisition Business Strategies The success of TerrAscendʼs business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses and to retain key employees of acquired businesses. If the Company is unsuccessful in doing so, it may negatively affect TerrAscendʼs business. TerrAscend may not be able to successfully integrate and combine the operations, personnel and technology infrastructure of any such acquired company with its existing operations. If integration is not managed successfully by TerrAscendʼs management, TerrAscend may experience interruptions to its business activities, deterioration in its employee and customer relationships, increased costs of integration and harm to its reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may experience difficulties in combining corporate cultures, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees. The integration of any such acquired companies may also impose substantial demands on management. There is no assurance that these acquisitions will be successfully integrated in a timely manner. See “— Risks Related to the Acquisition of Gage Growth Corp.—The Company and Gage may not integrate successfully, which may prevent the realization of the benefits of the Transaction and may have a material adverse effect on the Company .” There can be no assurance that the Company’s current and future strategic alliances will have a beneficial impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend currently has, and may in the future, enter into strategic alliances with third parties that it believes will complement or augment its existing business. TerrAscendʼs ability to complete strategic alliances is dependent upon, and may be limited by, the availability of suitable candidates and capital. In addition, strategic alliances could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs, may not enhance TerrAscendʼs business, and may involve risks that could adversely affect TerrAscend, including significant amounts of management time that may be diverted from operations in order to pursue and complete such transactions or maintain such strategic alliances. Future strategic alliances could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities, and there can be no assurance that future strategic alliances will achieve, or that TerrAscendʼs existing strategic alliances will continue to achieve, the expected benefits to TerrAscendʼs business or that TerrAscend will be able to consummate future strategic alliances on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s use of joint ventures may expose the Company to risks associated with jointly owned investments. TerrAscend currently operates parts of its business through joint ventures with other companies, and it may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Joint venture investments and partnerships may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by TerrAscend, including: (i) TerrAscend may not control the joint ventures; (ii) TerrAscend’s joint venture partners may not agree to distributions that it believe are appropriate; (iii) where TerrAscend does not have substantial decision-making authority, it may experience impasses or disputes with TerrAscend’s joint venture partners on certain decisions, which 40 could require it to expend additional resources to resolve such impasses or disputes, including litigation or arbitration; (iv) TerrAscend’s joint venture partners may become insolvent or bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfil their obligations as a joint venture partner; (v) the arrangements governing TerrAscend’s joint ventures may contain certain conditions or milestone events that may never be satisfied or achieved; (vi) TerrAscend’s joint venture partners may have business or economic interests that are inconsistent with TerrAscend’s and may take actions contrary to TerrAscend’s interests; (vii) TerrAscend may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by TerrAscend’s joint venture partners with respect to TerrAscend’s joint venture investments; and (viii) it may be difficult for TerrAscend to exit a joint venture if an impasse arises or if TerrAscend desires to sell its interest for any reason. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, TerrAscend may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of its joint venture partners. Risks Related to the Acquisition of Gage The Company may not realize the benefits of its growth strategy, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company believes that the completion of the Transaction will allow it to accelerate its strategic efforts to capitalize on significant growth opportunities by gaining exposure to the Michigan market. As part of its growth strategy, the Company will continue in its existing efforts and initiate new efforts to expand its footprint, and brand and marketing capabilities. Such expansion is dependent on availability of capital funding, achieving satisfactory returns on the acquisition of Gage, continuing to enter into successful business arrangements and certain assumptions about being able to achieve Gage’s projected growth strategy. The failure to successfully implement either its own strategic initiatives, or those with respect to Gage, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company and Gage may not integrate successfully, which may prevent the realization of the benefits of the Transaction and may have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Transaction involves the integration of companies that previously operated independently. As a result, the Transaction presents challenges to management, including the integration of the operations, systems and personnel of the two companies, and special risks, including possible unanticipated liabilities, costs and delays related to the integration of Gage into the Company’s systems and operations, diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and the potential for performance shortfalls as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the Transaction and integration of Gage and Gage personnel, the potential loss of key business, employment and other operational relationships and the inability to attract new employees and business and operational relationships. Many of the difficulties management encounters in the transition and integration process are outside of the Company’s control, which could result in an adverse effect on the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the Company, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the Company’s brand, business and financial condition. As a result of these factors, it is possible that any benefits expected from the Transaction to the Company may not ultimately be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Reliance on Licenses and Transfers Gageʼs business is dependent on its commercial arrangements with the owners of the licenses that Gage supports in the State of Michigan (the “Licensed Operators”), and such parties continuing their current operations, maintaining their respective licenses in good standing and applying for and receiving any additional necessary licenses and compliance with their terms. There can be no guarantee that any of the required licenses held by the Licensed Operators will be extended or renewed, or, if extended or renewed by the relevant authorities, that they will be extended or renewed on the same or similar terms. The failure by Gage or any of the Licensed Operators to comply with the requirements of any regulation or license or any failure to maintain any license or obtain any additional necessary licenses, or the existence of any material disagreement between Gage and the Licensed Operators, could have a material adverse impact on TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Separately, there can be no guarantee that ownership of all of the required licenses held by the Licensed Operators will be able to be transferred to TerrAscend. In such an event, TerrAscend would be reliant on services agreements with the Licensed Operators for an indefinite time period. Additionally, the Licensed Operators may be unable to manufacture and process products in line with the required quality standards, which could materially impact TerrAscend’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. As a result of all of these factors, it is possible that any benefits from the Transaction to the Corporation may not ultimately be realized. The issuance of a significant number of Common Shares and the resulting “market overhang” could adversely affect the market price of Common Shares after completion of the Transaction. 41 The issuance of a significant number of Common Shares and the resulting “market overhang” could adversely affect the market price of Common Shares. On the closing date , a significant number of additional Common Shares will be available for trading in the public market. The increase in the number of Common Shares may lead to sales of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market price of, Common Shares. The potential that TerrAscend shareholders may sell their Common Shares in the public market (commonly referred to as “market overhang”), as well as any actual sales of such Common Shares in the public market, could adversely affect the market price of the Common Shares. TerrAscend and Gage may be the target of securities class actions and derivative lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs to TerrAscend and may divert the attention of TerrAscend’s management, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company. TerrAscend and Gage may be the target of securities class actions and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may divert the attention of TerrAscend’s management, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into an agreement to acquire a public company or to be acquired. Third parties may also attempt to bring claims against TerrAscend and Gage seeking monetary compensation or other remedies. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. In addition, political and public attitudes towards the Transaction could result in negative press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting TerrAscend and Gage. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements could lead to investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims or otherwise negatively impact the ability of TerrAscend to take advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to the Company’s Common Shares The Company’s voting control is concentrated. Mr. Jason Wild, TerrAscendʼs Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Company’s Board, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over shares representing approximately 38.43% of the voting capital stock of the Company as of January 18, 2022. As a result, he exerts significant control over matters that may be put forth for the consideration of all TerrAscend shareholders, including for example, the approval of a potential business combination or consolidation, a liquidation or sale of all or substantially all of TerrAscendʼs assets, electing members to TerrAscend’s Board, and adopting amendments to TerrAscendʼs constating documents, including its articles of incorporation, as amended (the “ Articles ”) and by-laws. The Company’s Preferred Shares have a liquidation preference over the Common Shares, which could limit the Company’s ability to make distributions to the holders of Common Shares. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or upon any other return of capital or distribution of the assets of the Company among its shareholders, in each case for the purposes of winding up its affairs, the Company’s preferred shares (the “ Preferred Shares ”) are entitled to receive any distribution available to be paid out of the assets of the Company before the Proportionate Voting Shares, Common Shares and exchangeable shares of the Company (the “ Exchangeable Shares ”). Accordingly, should the Company be liquidated, dissolved or wound-up, the Company may be unable to make any distribution to the holders of the Common Shares. An investor may face liquidity risks with an investment in the Common Shares. TerrAscendʼs Common Shares are listed on the CSE and also trade over the counter in the US on the OTCQX® Best Market, however, there can be no assurance that an active and/or liquid market for Common Shares will develop or be maintained and an investor may find it difficult to resell any securities of TerrAscend. For example, certain banks will not execute any transactions in securities of cannabis-related businesses or have implemented restrictions and additional requirements for such transactions. The price of the Company’s Common Shares may be volatile, and may be adversely affected by the price of cannabis. 42 The market price of Common Shares may be subject to wide price fluctuations, and the price of TerrAscendʼs shares and its financial results may be significantly and adversely affected by a decline in the price of cannabis. There is currently no established market price for cannabis and the price of cannabis is affected by several factors beyond TerrAscendʼs control. For example, price fluctuations may be in response to many factors, including variations in the operating results of TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, divergence in financial results from analysts’ expectations, changes in earnings estimates by stock market analysts, changes in the business prospects for TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, general economic conditions, legislative changes, community support for the medical cannabis industry and other events and factors outside of TerrAscendʼs control. In addition, stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which, as well as general economic and political conditions, could adversely affect the market price for the Company’s Common Shares. Additional issuances of the Company’s securities may result in dilution. TerrAscend may issue additional securities in the future, which may dilute a TerrAscend shareholder’s holdings in TerrAscend. TerrAscendʼs Articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of Proportionate Voting Shares, Exchangeable Shares, Preferred Shares and Common Shares, and TerrAscend shareholders will have no pre-emptive rights in connection with such further issuance. For example, in connection with the recently completed Transaction with Gage, the Company issued approximately 51.3 million Common Shares to Gage shareholders and reserved approximately an additional 25.8 million Common Shares pursuant to the convertible securities of Gage which will be exchanged for convertible securities of the Company. The directors of TerrAscend have discretion to determine the price and the terms of issue of further issuances, and such terms could include rights, preferences and privileges superior to those existing holders. Moreover, additional Common Shares will be issued by TerrAscend on the exercise of options under TerrAscendʼs stock option plan and upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and upon the conversion of Proportionate Voting Shares, Exchangeable Shares and Preferred Shares. To the extent holders of TerrAscend’s stock options or other convertible securities convert or exercise their securities and sell Common Shares they receive, the trading price of the Common Shares may decrease due to the additional amount of Common Shares available in the market. TerrAscend cannot predict the size or nature of future issuances or the effect that future issuances and sales of Common Shares will have on the market price of the Common Shares. Issuances of a substantial number of additional Common Shares, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Shares. With any additional issuance of Common Shares, investors will suffer dilution to their voting power and economic interest in TerrAscend. Sales of substantial amounts of Common Shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Common Shares. Sales of a substantial number of Common Shares in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of Common Shares intend to sell Common Shares, could reduce the market price of Common Shares. Risks related to potential disqualification of equity holders by regulatory authorities. An individual with an ownership interest in TerrAscend could become disqualified from having such ownership interest in TerrAscend under a US state cannabis agency’s interpretation of the relevant state laws and regulations if such owner is convicted of a certain type of felony or fails to meet the residency requirements, if any, for owning equity in a company like TerrAscend. The loss of such equity holder could potentially have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. TerrAscend does not intend to pay dividends on its Common Shares for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of the Company’s Common Shares. TerrAscendʼs policy is to retain earnings to finance the development and enhancement of its products and to otherwise reinvest in TerrAscendʼs businesses. Therefore, TerrAscend does not anticipate paying cash dividends on Common Shares in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Company’s Board and will depend on, among other things, financial results, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Company’s Board may deem relevant. As a result, investors may not receive any return on investment in Common Shares unless they sell them for a share price that is greater than that at which such investors purchased them. General Risk Factors TerrAscend may not be able to obtain necessary permits and authorizations. TerrAscend may be required to obtain and maintain certain permits, licenses and approvals in the jurisdictions where its products are manufactured and/or sold. There can be no assurance that TerrAscend will be able to obtain or maintain any 43 necessary licenses, permits or approvals. Any material delay or inability to receive these items is likely to delay and/or inhibit TerrAscendʼs ability to conduct its business, and would have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may be subject to litigation, which could divert the attention of management and cause the Company to expend significant resources. TerrAscend may become party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business which could adversely affect its business. Should any litigation in which TerrAscend becomes involved be determined against TerrAscend, such a decision could adversely affect TerrAscendʼs ability to continue operating and the market price for Common Shares. Even if TerrAscend is involved in litigation and wins, litigation can redirect significant resources. The Company needs to attract and retain customers and patients in order to succeed, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. TerrAscendʼs success depends on its ability to attract and retain customers and patients. There are many factors which could impact TerrAscendʼs ability to attract and retain customers and patients, including but not limited to TerrAscendʼs ability to continually produce desirable and effective products and, the successful implementation of a customer and patient-acquisition plan. TerrAscendʼs failure to acquire and retain customers and patients would have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, operating results and financial condition. TerrAscend has a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects and predict future operating results. TerrAscend has a limited operating history and, accordingly, potential investors will have a limited basis on which to evaluate its ability to achieve its business objectives. The future success of TerrAscend is dependent on management’s ability to implement its strategy, there is no certainty that anticipated outcomes and sustainable revenue streams will be achieved and there is no certainty that TerrAscend will successfully produce commercial medical cannabis, establish a market for and sell its product, maintain its licenses or obtain other necessary licenses and/or approvals. TerrAscend faces risks frequently encountered by early-stage companies. In particular, its future growth and prospects will depend on its ability to expand its operation and gain additional revenue streams while at the same time maintaining effective cost controls. Any failure to expand is likely to have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition and results. As such, there is no assurance that TerrAscend will be successful in achieving a return on TerrAscend shareholders’ investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the early stage of operations. The Company may be subject to growth-related risks, which could negatively affect its business. TerrAscend may be subject to growth-related risks including capacity constraints and pressure on its internal systems and controls. The ability of TerrAscend to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand, train and manage its employee base. The inability of TerrAscend to deal with this growth may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscendʼs business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The Company faces risks and hazards that may not be covered by insurance. TerrAscendʼs business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally, including adverse environmental conditions, accidents, disputes and changes in the regulatory environment. Such occurrences could result in damage to assets, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in operations, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although TerrAscend maintains insurance to protect against certain risks in such amounts as it considers to be reasonable, its insurance does not cover all the potential risks associated with its operations. TerrAscend may also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability. Moreover, insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards encountered in the operations of TerrAscend is not generally available on acceptable terms. Losses from these events may cause TerrAscend to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon its financial performance and results of operations. 44 Item 1B.

The loan is secured by the assets of TerrAscendʼs Pennsylvania business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Legal Proceedings The Company is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings. Other than as noted below, TerrAscend believes that none of the litigation in which it is currently involved, or has been involved, in individually or in the aggregate, is material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. PharmHouse and 261 Matter On October 15, 2018, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary TerrAscend Canada entered into a multi-year cultivation agreement (the “PharmHouse Agreement”) with PharmHouse Inc. (“PharmHouse”), a joint venture between RIV Capital and 2615975 Ontario Inc., the operators of a leading North American greenhouse produce company (“261”). Under the terms of the PharmHouse Agreement, it was expected that PharmHouse would grow and supply cannabis to TerrAscend Canada from its existing 1.3 million square foot greenhouse located in Leamington, Ontario. Once fully licensed, the production of flower, trim and clones from up to 20% of the dedicated flowering space planted at the greenhouse was expected to be made available to TerrAscend Canada. To date, PharmHouse has not yet delivered product in accordance with the terms of the PharmHouse Agreement. On September 11, 2020, the Company and TerrAscend Canada were informed that a statement of claim was issued on August 31, 2020 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice by 261 against RIV Capital, Canopy Growth, the Company and TerrAscend Canada (the “261 Claim”). In the 261 Claim, 261 alleged the Company worked with the other defendants to bankrupt PharmHouse in order to avoid having to purchase certain products to be provided by PharmHouse under the PharmHouse Agreement. 261 sought damages from the defendants in the amount of C$500 million and alleged certain causes of action, including bad faith, fraud, civil conspiracy, breach of the duty of honesty and good faith in contractual relations and breach of fiduciary duty. On September 16, 2020, in connection with its bankruptcy proceedings, PharmHouse obtained an order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting PharmHouse creditor protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”). Pursuant to the CCAA order, the 261 Claim was stayed. During a CCAA hearing in November 2020, 261 objected to the stay of the 261 Claim. The judge presiding over the CCAA process agreed to allow 261 to discontinue the 261 Claim against the defendants “without prejudice” to its right to recommence the 261 Claim against all parties except PharmHouse Inc., provided that such recommenced claim can only be brought after January 1, 2021. This does not affect any of the defendants’ ability to move for a stay of the recommenced 261 Claim. On February 10, 2021, 261 served the Company and TerrAscend Canada with the recommenced 261 Claim. The recommenced 261 Claim contains the same factual allegations as the 261 Claim, the same legal claims and the same relief sought; however, it was not recommenced against PharmHouse Inc. The Company has not accrued any contingencies with respect to the recommenced 261 Claim. 47 On March 11, 2021, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice approved a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) between the Company, TerrAscend Canada and PharmHouse. 261 is not a party to the Settlement Agreement. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice held in its March 11, 2021 endorsement that nothing in the Settlement Agreement releases or compromises any of the claims or causes of action asserted against the Company or TerrAscend Canada in the recommenced 261 Claim. The Settlement Agreement provides that the Company make a one-time purchase of a specific quantity of cannabis that was grown under the PharmHouse Agreement for a set price per gram, totaling C$1,166,669.93, and for a one-time cash payment of C$725,000 to PharmHouse for full and final satisfaction of any claims or obligations between the Company, TerrAscend Canada and PharmHouse. The Company paid all amounts due under the Settlement Agreement and has commercialized the purchased cannabis. The Settlement Agreement does not affect the recommenced 261 Claim issued on February 10, 2021, as the plaintiff in the recommenced 261 Claim is not a party to the Settlement Agreement and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that nothing in the Settlement Agreement releases or compromises any of the claims or causes of action asserted against the Company or TerrAscend Canada in the recommenced 261 Claim. Investments International Matter On October 20, 2018, Investments International Inc. (“Investments”) signed a lease agreement with the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 2627685 Ontario Inc. and 2151924 Alberta Inc. On February 8, 2019, Investments filed a statement of claim under the Court of Alberta against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, for breach of the lease agreement. The amount claimed is $2,764 plus interest from and after the termination date of an unexecuted lease. The Company has paid initial lease deposits in addition to submitting a statement of defence.

TerrAscend operates a chain of The Apothecarium dispensary retail locations, as well as scaled cultivation, processing, and manufacturing facilities on both the east and west coasts of the United States. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent, high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use market. Notwithstanding various states in the US which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under US federal law for any purpose, by way of the CSA. TerrAscend operates under one operating segment for the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend’s portfolio of operating businesses and brands include: • Ilera Healthcare, a vertically integrated cannabis cultivator, processor and dispensary operator in Pennsylvania; • TerrAscend NJ LLC, a majority owned subsidiary that holds a permit to operate up to three alternative treatment centers in New Jersey with the ability to cultivate and process; • The Apothecarium, consisting of retail dispensaries in California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; • Valhalla Confections, a leading provider of premium edible products; • State Flower, a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Francisco, California; • HMS Health, LLC and HMS Processing, LLC, a producer and seller of cannabis flower for the wholesale medical cannabis market in Maryland; • Arise Bioscience, a manufacturer and distributor of hemp-derived products, located in Boca Raton, Florida; and TerrAscend Canada Inc., a Licensed Producer (as such term is defined in the Cannabis Act) of cannabis, whose principal business activities include processing and sale of cannabis flower and oil products in Canada. 51 TerrAscend also entered into the Arrangement Agreement on August 31, 2021 to acquire Gage, a company which provides support services to licensed Gage-branded cannabis cultivators, processors and provisioning centers, and Cookies-branded provisioning centers, in Michigan. For more information regarding the Acquisition of Gage, please see Item 1 – “ Business ” – “ Recent Developments ” – “ The Acquisition of Gage Growth Corp . ” Results from Operations - Years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019 The following tables represent the Company’s results from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019: Revenue, net For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Revenue $ 222,067 $ 157,906 $ 66,164 Excise and cultivation taxes (11,648 ) (10,073 ) (2,351 ) Revenue, net $ 210,419 $ 147,833 $ 63,813 $ change 62,586 84,020 % change 42 % 132 % The increase in net revenue at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was due to an increase of $42,410 in retail sales from $44,709 at December 31, 2020 to $87,119 at December 31, 2021, and an increase of $20,176 in wholesale sales from $103,124 at December 31, 2020 to $123,300 at December 31, 2021. The increase in retail sales was primarily a result of the increase in retail dispensaries across Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey, which increased from nine at the end of 2020 to thirteen at the end of 2021. The increase in wholesale sales was primarily a result of the initial ramp up in New Jersey, expansion in Pennsylvania, as well as the acquisition of HMS. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was due to an increase of $56,431 in wholesale sales from $46,693 at December 31, 2019 to $103,124 at December 31, 2020, and an increase of $27,589 in retail sales from $17,120 at December 31, 2019 to $44,709 at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to operational scale up as well as a full year of operations from the Company’s acquisitions. The Company acquired The Apothecarium in June 2019, Ilera in September 2019, and State Flower in January 2020. The Company continued to expand organically through an increase in production and wholesale capacity in Pennsylvania and store expansions in Pennsylvania and California. In addition, the Company opened its first alternative treatment center in Phillipsburg, New Jersey during the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of Sales For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Cost of sales $ 94,104 $ 62,702 $ 54,299 Impairment of inventory 4,211 4,111 6,956 Total cost of sales $ 98,315 $ 66,813 $ 61,255 $ change 31,502 5,558 % change 47 % 9 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 44 % 42 % 93 % The increase in cost of sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was a result of the increased volume of sales. The increase in the ratio of cost of sales relative to revenue is a result of yield declines in Pennsylvania and a higher mix of retail versus wholesale. The increase in cost of sales from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was due to operational scale up as well as a full year of operations as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of The Apothecarium in June 2019, Ilera in September 2019 and State Flower in January 2020. In addition, the Company has continued to expand production capacity and wholesale and retail sales presence. The Company’s production facility in Pennsylvania tripled production capacity in the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in the ratio of cost of sales relative to net sales is a result of the Company becoming more cost efficient throughout its production process. 52 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded impairment of $2,322, related to aged, obsolete, or unsaleable inventories at its Canada and Florida operations. Additionally, the Company recorded impairment of $1,889 at its Pennsylvania operations related to inventory that did not meet its quality standards. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded inventory impairments of $4,111 and $6,956, respectively, relating to raw materials and Cannabis products (finished goods) exceeding the net realizable value. Management determines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Of the impairment charges during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $1,795 of the charges were related to write down of inventory purchased from a third-party supplier, during the current period, at prices per prior signed agreements. The impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 were due to the carrying value of inventory exceeding the estimated net realizable value. General and Administrative Expense (G&A) For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 General and administrative expense $ 80,973 $ 65,534 $ 45,898 $ change 15,439 19,636 % change 24 % 43 % G&A as a % of revenue 36 % 42 % 69 % G&A excluding share-based compensation 66,031 55,459 39,160 G&A excluding share-based compensation as a % of revenue 30 % 35 % 59 % The increase in G&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of increased salaries and wages of $11,716, mainly as a result of the increase in US operations. Additionally, the Company recognized increased share-based compensation expense of $4,867, primarily due to the greater number of options granted to new employees during the latter half of 2020, resulting in higher expenses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as well as expense related to the acceleration of options related to severance. In addition, the Company paid $2,121 in one-time legal settlements during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in G&A expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was partially reduced by a decrease in professional fees from the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of payments due of $7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses. Excluding this payment, professional fees increased $6,283 primarily due to legal fees and fees for US filer preparation. The increase in G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in professional fees related to payments due of $7,500 to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend New Jersey. Additionally, the Company recognized an increase in share-based compensation expense of $3,337 due to options granted to new employees in 2020 and vesting of RSU grants. No RSU grants vested during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in G&A was also partially driven by the full year impact of the acquisitions of The Apothecarium, Ilera and State Flower in 2019 and the organic expansion of dispensaries in California and Pennsylvania. Amortization and Depreciation Expense For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Amortization and depreciation $ 7,656 $ 5,562 $ 3,067 $ change 2,094 2,495 % change 38 % 81 % The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily related to additions of property and equipment due to the Company’s cultivation expansions and increase in dispensaries in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California. 53 The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by a full year of US operations as a result of the acquisitions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the Company completed construction of the cultivation facility in New Jersey and began recording depreciation during the year ended December 31, 2020. Revaluation of contingent considerations For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Revaluation of contingent consideration $ 3,584 $ 18,709 $ 46,857 $ change (15,125 ) (28,148 ) % change -81 % -60 % The decrease in the revaluation of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is a result of a reduction in the liability as compared to December 31, 2020 due to payments for the earnout of Ilera of $29,668 made subsequent to December 31, 2020, reducing the amount outstanding. This decrease is partially offset by the accretion of contingent consideration payable, which was recorded at the present value of future payments upon initial recognition. The decrease in the revaluation of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 is a result of a reduction in the liability as compared to December 31, 2019 due to payments of $147,184, reducing the amount outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by the accretion of the contingent consideration payable for Ilera and State Flower which were recorded at the present value of future payments upon initial recognition. (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset $ (57,904 ) $ 110,518 $ — $ change (168,422 ) 110,518 % change -152 % 100 % The Preferred Share warrant liability has been remeasured to fair value at December 31, 2021 using the Black Scholes model. The Company recognized a gain during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the reduction of the Company’s share price from December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2021, as well as from warrants exercised during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $58,158 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.

In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a reduction to the indemnification asset related to The Apothecarium’s tax audit settlement 54 and statute expirations for tax years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2015 in the amount of $4,504 included in finance and other expenses, with an offset recorded to reduce the Company’s income tax provision (refer to “Provision for income taxes” below). During the current period, finance and other expenses is partially offset by $1,414 of other income related to the forgiveness of the Company’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans received by the Company’s Arise business. The finance expense in the comparable prior year period was primarily related to borrowings on the $75,000 credit facility with JW Asset Management LLC, as well as the Canopy Growth loan (formerly RIV Capital loan) entered into in the latter half of 2019, and the Canopy Growth Canada Inc financing received in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in finance and other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was due to the Ilera term loan, Canopy Growth Arise loan, RIV Capital loan, and convertible debt entered into during the year ended December 31, 2020.

The transaction and restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 are related to acquisition costs for State Flower and Preferred Share issuance costs. Transaction and restructuring costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ended December 31, 2019 mainly due to the acquisitions of Grander, The Apothecarium and Ilera during the year ended December 31, 2019. Impairment of goodwill For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Impairment of goodwill $ 5,007 $ — $ 45,802 $ change 5,007 (45,802 ) % change 100 % -100 % The impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 relates to the Company’s Florida reporting unit as the Company determined that the estimated cash flows of its Arise business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill. As a result, the Company recorded impairment to reduce the balance of goodwill at its Florida reporting unit to $nil. During the year ended December 31, 2019, it was determined that the fair values of TerrAscend’s Canada and California reporting units were more likely than not less than their carrying amounts and as such a one-step impairment test was performed. The following significant assumptions are applied in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units: • Cash flows: estimated cash flows were projected based on actual operating results form internal sources, as well as industry and market trends. The forecasts were extended to a total of five years (with a terminal value thereafter); • Terminal value growth rate: the terminal growth rate was based on historical and projected consumer price inflation, historical and projected economic indicators and projected industry growth; • Post-tax discount rate: the post-tax discount rate is reflective of the reporting units weighted average cost of capital (“ WACC ”). The WACC was estimated based on the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, beta premium and after-tax cost of debt based on corporate bond yields; and • Tax rate: the tax rate used in determining the future cash flows were those substantively enacted at the respective valuation date 55 As a result of the impairment tests performed, the Company determined that the carrying values of the Canada and California reporting units were less than their fair values. As such, the Company recorded impairment of $1,82 5 related to its Canada reporting unit, and $43,977 related to its California reporting unit. Impairment of intangible assets For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Impairment of intangible assets $ 3,633 $ 766 $ 3,309 $ change 2,867 (2,543 ) % change 374 % -77 % The impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 relates to the write-off of intellectual property at the Company’s Arise business.

Impairment of property and equipment For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Impairment of property and equipment $ 470 $ 823 $ 1,746 $ change (353 ) (923 ) % change -43 % -53 % During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company determined that equipment purchased for the purpose of extracting CBD and THC oils to support the medical cannabis business in Canada needed to be assessed for impairment as the equipment was never put into use and the Company has since exited the medical cannabis business in Canada. The Company evaluated the recoverability of the asset to determine whether it would be recoverable, and it was determined that the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows and, therefore, recorded an impairment loss of $470. The impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were a result of the Company’s strategic decision to cease the growing and cultivation of cannabis in Canada. The Company performed an impairment analysis over the assets that could not be sold. As a result of the impairment analysis, the Company wrote down the net book value of the lighting and irrigation assets previously used in the Canadian cultivation business to $nil. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company shut down its proposed Drug Preparation Premises business as management deemed that market conditions could not support this business and was determined to be no longer commercially viable.

See Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” – “ Regulatory and Legal Risks to the Company’s Business Due to the Nature of the Industry ” – “ The Company’s business is subject to applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations and have restricted access to capital markets, banking and other financial services, which may adversely affect TerrAscend’s business ” for further information. The Company’s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance its research and development activities, corporate and administration expenses, working capital and overall capital expenditures. Since inception, the Company has primarily financed its liquidity needs through the issuance of shares and utilization of borrowings. The Company expects that its cash on hand and cash flows from operations, along with financing transactions, will be adequate to meet its capital requirements and operational needs for the next 12 months. Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Net cash used in operating activities $ (31,815 ) $ (36,971 ) $ (39,841 ) During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made payments in excess of the amount of fair value of the contingent consideration payable at the date of the Ilera acquisition on September 16, 2019 of $11,394 as compared to payments of $56,527 during the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding these amounts, the Company had net cash used in operating activities of $22,669 and cash provided by operating activities of $19,556 (refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase in cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 is mainly the result of income tax payments of $37,060 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $11,204 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and interest payments of $21,694 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $2,192 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest payments is primarily due to the Ilera term loan in which the Company received proceeds during December 2020. Excluding these payments, the Company saw an increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, which is primarily due to increased sales. The improvement in the net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, is primarily due to a ramp up of the US operations, partially offset by income tax payments of $11,204. Excluding the payments of contingent consideration for Ilera in excess of the amount of the fair value of the contingent consideration payable at the date of acquisition made during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had positive cash provided by operating activities of $19,556 (refer to “ Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures ” below). 58 Cash flows from investing activities For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Net cash used in investing activities $ (132,421 ) $ (45,890 ) $ (104,218 ) The net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relates to cash consideration paid for the acquisitions of KCR and HMS totaling $42,736. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made payments of $50,000 related to the purchase of the additional 12.5% of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ from BWH NJ, LLC and Blue Marble Ventures, LLC. Additionally, the Company had investments in property and equipment of $38,483 primarily related to the buildout of the New Jersey operations and expansions in Pennsylvania cultivation and $1,977 related to deposits paid for the expansion of the cultivation premises in Pennsylvania. In comparison, the net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to investments in property and equipment of $44,621 primarily relating to the buildout of the New Jersey operations and expansions in Pennsylvania and California cultivation. The net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to cash consideration paid of $67,540 on the acquisitions of Grander, Ilera and The Apothecarium, as well as investments in property and equipment of $32,834, primarily related to the expansion of its Pennsylvania and initial buildout of its New Jersey operations, and investments in notes receivable of $10,456. Cash flows from financing activities For the years ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 182,201 $ 133,406 $ 136,934 Net cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, was mainly a result of the private placement on January 28, 2021, in which the Company issued 18,115,656 Common Shares at a price of $9.64 (C$12.35) per Common Share for total proceeds of $173,477, net of share issuance costs of $1,643. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 8,755,339 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of $21,735 and 1,376,496 stock options were exercised at $0.67-$6.93 (C$0.85-$8.52) per unit for total gross proceeds of $5,462. In addition, 1,968 Preferred Share warrants were exercised at $3,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of $3,588. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Ilera of $18,274 and by payments of loan principal of $4,500 related to the KCR loan. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to loan proceeds in the amount of $201,496 and proceeds from private placements net of share issuance costs of $71,023. Additionally, 829,050 Common Share warrants were exercised for total gross proceeds of $2,075 and 1,816,496 stock options were exercised at $0.43-$6.52 per unit for total gross proceeds of $4,462. In addition, 625 Preferred Share warrants were exercised at $3,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of $750. The cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by payments of contingent consideration of $90,657 to the sellers of Ilera, as well as payments of principal on the Company’s outstanding loans of $53,886 to pay off the remaining balance of the JW Asset Management credit facility, a financing loan in Canada, and the loans from management of Ilera. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $38,000 from JW Asset Management and management of Ilera, as well as proceeds from a mortgage assumed on the Canadian facility of $4,843. Additionally, the Company received proceeds from convertible debt in the amount of $15,336 from RIV Capital. Total private placement net of shares issuance proceeds amounted to $49,955. Additionally, 959,772 Common Share warrants and 28,636 proportionate share warrants were exercised for total gross proceeds of $24,927 and 1,117,936 stock options were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of $1.79 per unit for gross proceeds of $1,967. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company’s ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and the Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA as 59 EBITDA adjusted for certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes this definition is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of the Company ’ s underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. The table below reconciles net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For the years ended Summary of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Notes December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Net income (loss) $ 6,135 $ (142,256 ) $ (163,147 ) Add (deduct) the impact of: Provision for income taxes 28,314 10,769 1,769 Finance expenses 24,662 8,416 3,694 Amortization and depreciation 15,390 10,433 4,444 EBITDA (a) 74,501 $ (112,638 ) $ (153,240 ) Add (deduct) the impact of: Non-cash write downs of inventory (b) 2,417 $ 3,668 $ 6,956 Relief of fair value of inventory upon acquisition (c) 3,465 (230 ) 2,677 Share-based compensation (d) 14,941 10,475 7,661 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (e) 8,640 766 49,111 Impairment of property and equipment (f) 470 823 1,746 Loss on lease termination (g) 3,278 — — Revaluation of contingent consideration (h) 3,584 18,709 46,857 Restructuring costs and executive severance (i) 931 1,023 121 Legal settlements (j) 2,121 — — Fees for services related to NJ licenses (k) — 7,500 — Other one-time items (l) 6,070 1,070 8,323 (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset (m) (57,904 ) 110,518 — Indemnification asset release (n) 4,504 — — Unrealized and realized (gain) loss on investments and notes receivable (o) (6,192 ) (186 ) 4,394 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss (p) 4,810 178 313 Adjusted EBITDA $ 65,636 $ 41,676 $ (25,081 ) (a) EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. (b) Represents inventory write downs outside the normal course of operations. (c) In connection with the Company’s acquisitions, inventory was acquired at fair value, which included a markup or markdown for profit. Recording inventory at fair value in purchase accounting has the effect of increasing or decreasing inventory and thereby increasing or decreasing cost of sales as compared to the amounts the Company would have recognized if the inventory was sold through at cost. The write-up or write-down of acquired inventory represents the incremental cost of sales that were recorded during purchase accounting. (d) Represents non-cash share-based compensation expense. (e) Represents impairment charges taken on the Company’s intangible assets and goodwill. (f) Represents impairment charges taken on the Company’s property and equipment. (g) Represents loss taken as a result of the Company’s early termination payment on its Frederick, Maryland lease. ( h ) Represents the loss on period end revaluation of the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities. ( i ) Represents costs associated with severance and restructuring of business units. ( j ) Represents one-time legal settlement charges. ( k ) Represents amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ due upon NJ being granted an alternative treatment center license in the state of New Jersey and NJ making its first sale of medical cannabis to a patient in compliance with the New Jersey Compassionate Use Marijuana Act. ( l ) Includes one-time fees incurred in connection with the Company’s acquisitions, such as expenses related to professional fees, consulting, legal and accounting, that would otherwise not have been incurred. In addition, includes 60 one-time charges for work completed in preparation of becoming a US filer. These fees are not indicative of the Company ’ s ongoing costs and are expected to be incurred only as additional acquisitions are completed. ( m ) Represents the (gain) loss on fair value of warrants, including effects of the foreign exchange of the US denominated Preferred Share warrants, as well as the revaluation of the fair value of the purchase option derivative asset. ( n ) Represents the reduction to the indemnification asset related to The Apothecarium’s tax audit settlement and statute expirations for tax years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2015. ( o ) Represents unrealized and realized loss and gains on fair value changes on strategic investments and note receivables held. ( p ) Represents the remeasurement of USD denominated cash and other assets recorded in C$ functional currency. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to operational scale up, as well as the Company’s acquisitions of KCR and HMS. The Company continued to expand in the US organically through an increase in production and wholesale capacity in Pennsylvania, store expansions in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, and operations in New Jersey and Maryland. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, was a result of operational scale up as well as a full year of operations from the Company’s acquisitions. The Company acquired The Apothecarium in June 2019, Ilera in September 2019, and State Flower in January 2020. The growth in the US was offset by the reduction of operations in Canada in 2020, which was driven by a shift in focus towards more profitable and sustainable sales. The table below reconciles net cash used in operating activities to adjusted net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The Company calculates adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to adjust net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the one-time payments of contingent consideration as the Company does not believe that these payments are reflective of ongoing operations. For the years ended December 31 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31 2019 Net cash used in operating activities $ (31,815 ) $ (36,971 ) $ (39,841 ) Add the impact of: Contingent consideration payments in excess of fair value on acquisition 11,394 56,527 — Adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (20,421 ) $ 19,556 $ (39,841 ) The amount of contingent consideration paid in excess of the liability recognized at the date of acquisition is reflected as net cash used in operating activities in the Statements of Cash Flows. Excluding this amount, the Company had positive cash provided by operating activities of $19,556 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net cash used in operating activities of $20,421 and $39,841 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2019, respectively. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has $224,171 in principal amount of loans payable outstanding at December 31, 2021. Of this amount, $4,490 are due within the next twelve months. The Company has entered into operating leases for certain premises and offices for which it owes monthly lease payments. In addition, the Company’s undiscounted contingent consideration payable is $17,782 at December 31, 2021. The contingent consideration payable relates to the Company’s business acquisitions of The Apothecarium and State Flower. Contingent consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the agreement. The contingent consideration is revalued at the end of each reporting period using a probability weighted model based on the likelihood of achieving certain revenue outcomes. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity, as described above under “Liquidity and Capital Resources”, to allow the Company to meet these contractual obligations. 61 Subsequent Transactions On March 10, 2022, the Company closed its previously announced acquisition of Gage Growth Corp. (“Gage”) pursuant to an arrangement agreement dated August 31, 2021 (as amended) (the “Gage Acquisition”). The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares (or equivalent) of Gage. At closing, Gage shareholders received 51,349,978 Common Shares and an additional 25,811,460 of Common Shares are reserved for issuance in connection with the exercise or exchange of former Gage convertible securities that will be settled with the Company’s Common Shares if and when exercised or exchanged. Total consideration was approximately $386 million based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the Canadian Stock Exchange (“CSE”) on March 9, 2022, to be issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration available under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Changes in or Adoption of Accounting Principles New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted: The Company adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during the year ended December 31, 2021. Information regarding the Company’s adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. While the Company’s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K, the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the Company considers to be the most critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgement involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the financial condition. A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is available to reasonably estimate the impact and provides material information to investors. Inventory The net realizable value of inventory represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment, including consideration of factors such as shrinkage, the aging of and future demand for inventory, expected future selling price the Company expects to realize by selling the inventory, and the contractual arrangements with customers. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based upon quantities on hand, projected volumes from demand forecasts and net realizable value. The future realization of these inventories may be affected by market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. A change to these assumptions could impact the Company’s inventory valuation and gross profit. Revenue recognition Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales, which are recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the purchaser and the collectability is reasonably assured. From time to time, the Company partakes in sales agreements with suppliers in which it also purchases inventory. As part of the five-step revenue model, the Company assesses whether instances of bulk sales made to suppliers of goods have commercial substance and should be recognized as revenue under ASC 606, or whether the transaction should be assessed under ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions. The determination of whether the sale has commercial substance requires management’s judgment. 62 Share-based compensation In calculating share-based compensation, key estimates are used such as, the rate of forfeiture of options granted, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the Company’s stock price, the vesting period of the option and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. While assumptions used to calculate and account for share-based compensation awards represent management’s best estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if revisions are made to the underlying assumptions and estimates, share based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period. The Company recognized share-based compensation expense of $14,942, $10,075, and $6,738 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Warrant Liability The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of the warrants issued, which includes various unobservable inputs such as the volatility of the Company’s stock price and the risk-free interest rate. The Company uses judgment to select methods used and in performing the fair value calculations at the initial measurement at issuance, as well as for subsequent measurement on a recurring basis. The assumptions could have a material impact on the valuation of the warrant liability. The warrant liability was remeasured to fair value of $54,986 and $132,257 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. An increase of 50 basis points to the discount rate and volatility would not have a material impact. Income taxes The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized is based on an assessment of the probability of the Company generating future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized. In addition, significant judgment is required in classifying transactions and assessing probable outcomes of tax positions taken, and in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties in various tax jurisdictions. Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. It is possible, however, that at some future date, an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. If the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The Company uses an income-based approach as necessary to assess the fair values of intangible assets and its reporting units for goodwill testing purposes. Under the income approach, fair value is based on the present value of estimated cash flows. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the most recent information available. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Determining the value in use requires the Company to estimate expected future cash flows associated with the assets and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts, and market data are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and intangible assets. The Company’s impairment loss calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgement to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting projected financial information and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. If actual results are not consistent with the Company’s estimates and assumptions, the Company may be exposed to non-cash impairment losses that could be material. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made a decision to undertake a strategic review process to explore, review, and evaluate potential alternatives for its Arise business. The Company also determined that the estimated future cash flows for the business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill, and therefore, the intangible 63 assets and goodwill were written down to $nil. The Company recorded impairment of intangible assets of $3,633 and impairment of goodwill of $5,007. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for each of its reporting units. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California and Maryland reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative impairment analysis was performed. The Company performed a quantitative analysis over its Pennsylvania reporting unit and determined that the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, resulting in no impairment. An increase of the discount rate of 100 basis points would not cause an impairment. There is no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets at the Company’s Canada reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for each of its reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California and Pennsylvania reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative analyses was performed. The Company performed a quantitative analysis over its Florida reporting unit and determined that the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%, resulting in no impairment. An increase in the discount rate of 100 basis points would not cause an impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for each of its reporting units and determined that the fair values of its Canada and California reporting units were more likely than not less than the respective carrying values, and therefore, the Company performed a one-step impairment test for each reporting unit. As a result of the one-step impairment tests, the Company recorded impairment loss on goodwill at its Canada reporting unit of $1,825 and impairment loss of $43,977 at its California reporting unit. Additionally, the Company recorded impairment of its indefinite lived intangible assets at its California reporting unit of $2,928. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, ROU assets, and definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Management judgement is required in the determination of indicators of impairment, as well as the estimation of future undiscounted cash flows, and as necessary, the fair value of those assets or asset groups in which indicators of impairment have been identified. The Company recorded impairment of property and equipment of $470, $823, and $1,746 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Business combinations Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or an asset acquisition depends on whether the asset acquire constitutes a business, which can be a complex judgement. The Company has determined that its acquisitions in Note 4 are business combinations under ASC 805 Business Combinations. In a business combination, substantially all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. One of the most significant areas of judgment and estimation relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities, including the fair value of contingent consideration, if applicable. If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, the Company may utilize an independent external valuation expert to develop the fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, which are generally based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. These valuations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in the discount rate applied. The estimates are based upon assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. 64 Contingent Consideration Contingent consideration payable as the result of a business combination is recorded at the date of acquisition at fair value. The fair value of contingent consideration is subject to significant judgement and estimates, such as projected future revenue. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are measured at each reporting date, with changes recognized through profit or loss. Refer to Note 21 included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the sensitivity analysis performed over the contingent consideration liability. Incremental borrowing rates Lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available. If that rate cannot be easily determined, the lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company estimates it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The Company calculates its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate the Company would pay to borrow funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value over similar terms taking into consideration the economic factors and the credit risk rating at the commencement date of the lease. In addition, the Company utilizes a discount rate to determine the appropriate fair value of convertible debentures and loans issued with warrants attached. The discount rate applied reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount at a similar term and with a similar security. Control, joint control or level of influence When determining the appropriate basis of accounting for the Company’s interests in affiliates, the Company makes judgments about the degree of influence that it exerts directly or through an arrangement over the investees’ relevant activities. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that the Company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the Company’s consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (b) in which the Company has total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more, or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the Company’s voting and non-voting common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th; and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the Company’s financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. The Company’s market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation and interest rates. The Company does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. Financial Instruments and Risk Management Financial instruments recorded at fair value are estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities Level 2- inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) from observable market data 65 Level 3- inputs for assets and liabilities not based upon observable market data Risk Management The Company’s risk exposure and the impact on the Company’s financial instruments are summarized below: (a) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and notes receivable. Company assesses the credit risk of trade receivables by evaluating the aging of trade receivables based on the invoice date. The carrying amounts of trade receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When a trade receivable balance is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for expected credit losses. The Company has reviewed the items comprising the accounts receivable balance and determined that the majority of accounts are collectible; accordingly, an allowance for doubtful accounts has been recorded. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company regularly monitors credit risk exposure and takes steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in actual loss. The Company has no customers whose balance is greater than 10% of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2021. (b) Liquidity risk The Company is exposed to liquidity risk, or the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages liquidity risk through ongoing review of its capital requirements. The Company’s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations. (c) Market Risk The significant market risk exposures to which the Company is exposed are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. i) Foreign currency risk: Foreign currency risk is the risk that a variation in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and US dollar and other foreign currencies will affect the Company’s operations and financial results. The Company and its subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company does not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. Consequently, fluctuations in foreign currencies could have a negative impact on the profitability of the Company’s operations. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar resulted in $3,191 potential loss. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar resulted in a $3,900 potential gain. The estimated fair values of the Company’s foreign currency exchange rate. Other than the cash and cash equivalents noted previously, the Company does not hold significant monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than its functional currency. ii) Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. In respect of financial assets, the Company’s policy is to invest excess cash at floating rates of interest in cash equivalents, in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the value of cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in guaranteed investment certificates bear a fixed rate and are cashable at any time prior to maturity date. The company does not have significant cash equivalents at year end. The Company’s loans payable have fixed interest rates from 6% to 12.875% per annum. The mortgage payable bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.5% per annum. All other financial liabilities are non-interest-bearing instruments. Item 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Acco untants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s management, with the participation of its Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, management, including the Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, determined that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2021. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting This Form 10-K does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) or an attestation report of our independent registered accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC. Additionally, our independent registered accounting firm will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes to the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d‑15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TerrAscend Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

F-8 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) 1. Nature of operations TerrAscend Corp. (“TerrAscend” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act on March 7, 2017. TerrAscend provides cannabis products, brands, and services to the United States (“US”) and Canada cannabinoid market. With operations in both Canada and the US, TerrAscend participates in the medical and legal adult use market across Canada and in several US states where cannabis has been legalized for therapeutic or adult use. TerrAscend operates a number of synergistic businesses, including The Apothecarium (“Apothecarium”), a cannabis dispensary with several retail locations in California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; Arise Bioscience Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of hemp-derived products; Ilera Healthcare (“Ilera”), Pennsylvania’s medical cannabis cultivator, processor and dispenser; HMS Health, LLC and HMS Processing, LLC (collectively “HMS”), a medical cannabis cultivator and processor based in Maryland; Valhalla Confections, a manufacturer of cannabis-infused edibles; and State Flower a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Francisco. TerrAscend holds a permit to operate as an alternative treatment center in New Jersey, which allows for the cultivation and processing of cannabis with the ability to operate up to three alternative treatment centers. The Company was listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange effective May 3, 2017, having the ticker symbol TER and effective October 22, 2018, the Company began trading on OTCQX under the ticker symbol TRSSF. The Company’s registered office is located at PO Box 43125, Mississauga, Ontario, L5C 1W2. 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (a) Basis of presentation and measurement These consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) of the Company and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value as described herein. (b) Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of the Company and its Canadian subsidiaries is Canadian dollars (“C$”). The functional currency of the Company’s US subsidiaries is the US dollar (“USD”). The Company’s presentation currency is in USD. All amounts are presented in USD unless otherwise specified. References to C$ are to Canadian dollars. (c) Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company consolidates legal entities in which it holds a controlling financial interest. The Company has a two-tier consolidation model: one focused on voting rights (the voting interest model) and the second focused on a qualitative analysis of power over significant activities and exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits (the variable interest model). All entities are first evaluated to determine whether they are variable interest entities (“VIE”). If an entity is determined not to be a VIE, it is assessed on the basis of voting and other decision-making rights under the voting interest model. The accounts of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances and transactions were eliminated on consolidation. (d) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand at retail locations, demand deposits with financial institutions and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash held in money market investments are carried at fair value, cash held in financial institution and cash held at retail locations have carrying values that approximate fair value. F-9 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) (e) Inventory Inventories of harvested and purchased finished goods and packaging materials are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is determined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The direct and indirect costs of inventory include materials, labor and depreciation expense on equipment involved in packaging, labeling and inspection. Amortization of acquired cannabis production licenses are also considered to be indirect costs of inventory. All direct and indirect costs related to inventory are capitalized as they are incurred and they are subsequently recorded within cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations at the time cannabis is sold. Products for resale and supplies and consumables are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews inventory for obsolete, redundant, and slow-moving goods, and any such inventories are written down to net realizable value. (f) Property and equipment and long-lived assets held for sale Property and equipment is measured at cost, including capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms: Buildings and improvements Lesser of useful life or 30 years Land Not depreciated Machinery & equipment 5-15 years Office furniture & production equipment 3-5 years Right of use assets Lease term Assets in process Not depreciated Assets in process are transferred to the appropriate asset type when available for use and depreciation of the assets commences at that point. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at their estimated fair value less costs to sell. The Company discontinues depreciation on these assets. An asset’s residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that the current estimate or depreciation method are no longer applicable. Changes are adjusted prospectively if appropriate. Gains and losses on disposal of an asset are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the items and are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are recognized when the assets are reclassified as assets held for sale or when impaired as part of an asset group’s impairment. The Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment and long-lived assets held for sale, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. See – Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its property and equipment. The Company capitalizes interest and borrowing costs on significant qualifying capital construction projects. Upon the asset becoming available for use, capitalization of borrowing costs ceases, and depreciation commences on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset. (g) Leases The Company’s leases are primarily operating leases for corporate offices, retail dispensaries, and cultivation and manufacturing facilities. The operating lease periods generally range from 1 to 28 years. The Company’s leases include fixed payments, as well as in some cases, scheduled base rent increases over the term of the lease. Certain leases require variable payments of common area maintenance, operating expenses, and real estate taxes applicable to the property. Variable payments are excluded from the measurements of lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Any tenant improvement allowances received from the lessor are recorded as a reduction to rent expense over the F-10 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) term of the lease. None of the Company’s lease agreements contained residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the contract. Lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term for those arrangements where there is an identified asset and the contract conveys the right to control its use. The right-of-use (“ROU”) asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, and initial direct costs. For operating leases, right-of-use assets are reduced over the lease term by the straight-line expense recognized, less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest rate method. Finance leases are included in property and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net and accrued obligations on the Company’s finance leases is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales and general and administrative expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Finance lease cost includes amortization, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method and is included in finance and other expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company applies a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. The majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate that can be easily determined, and therefore uses its incremental borrowing rate and the information available at the commencement date (refer to Note 10). Certain leases include one or more options to renew or terminate the lease at the Company’s discretion. The Company regularly evaluates lease renewal and termination options and, when they are reasonably certain of exercise, includes the renewal or termination option in the lease term. The Company evaluates its ROU assets for impairment consistent with its impairment of long-lived assets. See – Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its right-of-use assets. In some instances, the Company subleases excess office space to third party tenants. The Company, as sublessor, continues to account for the head lease. If the lease cost for the term of the sublease exceeds the Company’s anticipated sublease income for the same period, this indicates that the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease should be assessed for impairment under the long-lived asset impairment provisions. Sublease income is included in Finance (expense) income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company accounts for non-lease and lease components to which they relate as a single lease component. Additionally, the Company recognized lease payments under short-term leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, as well as low value assets, as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term without recognizing the lease liability and ROU asset. (h) Goodwill Goodwill is recorded at the time of acquisition and represents the excess of the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. See – Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets. F-11 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) (i) Intangible assets Intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives, which do not exceed the contractual period, if any. The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed annually and any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following terms: Brand intangibles- indefinite lives Indefinite useful lives or 3 years Brand intangibles- definite lives 3 years Software 5 years Licenses 5-30 years Customer relationships 5 years Non-compete agreements 3 years Licenses relating to cultivation and dispensaries are amortized using a useful life consistent with the property and equipment to which they relate. Intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives, which include brand names, are not subject to amortization but the carrying value is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. See – Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company’s impairment assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets. (j) Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill The Company operates as one operating segment. For the purposes of testing goodwill, the Company has identified five reporting units. The Company analyzed its reporting units by first reviewing the operating statements based on geographic areas in which the Company conducts business (or each market). The Company’s reporting units to which goodwill has been assigned include Pennsylvania, California, Florida, Maryland, and Canada. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangibles and reporting unit for goodwill to their estimated fair values. (k) Impairment of long-lived assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, ROU assets, and definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. F-12 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) (l) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized by the Company in accordance with ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard requires sales to be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer and at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring those goods or services. This is achieved by applying the following five steps: i) identify the contract with a customer; ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; iii) determine the transaction price; iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and v) recognize sales when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales, which are recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the purchaser and the collectability is reasonably assured. This is generally when goods have been delivered, which is also when the performance obligations have been fulfilled under the terms of the related sales contract. Revenue from retail sales of cannabis to customers for a fixed price is recognized when the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer at the point of sale and the customer has accepted and paid for the goods. Revenue for wholesale sales for a fixed price is recognized upon delivery to the customer. Sales are recorded net of returns and discounts and incentives, but inclusive of freight. Payment is typically due upon transferring the goods to the customer or within a specified time period permitted under the Company’s credit policy. All shipping and handling activities are performed before the customers obtain control of products and are accounted for as cost of sales. From time to time, the Company partakes in sales agreements with suppliers in which it also purchases inventory. As part of the five-step revenue model, the Company assesses whether instances of bulk sales made to suppliers of goods have commercial substance and should be recognized as revenue, or whether they should be assessed under ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions. Local authorities will often impose excise or cultivation taxes on the sale or production of cannabis products. Excise and cultivation taxes are effectively a production tax which become payable when a cannabis product is delivered to the customer and are not directly related to the value of sales. The excise is borne by the Company and is included in revenue. The subtotal “net revenue” on the statements of operations and consolidated loss represents the revenue as defined by ASC 606, minus the excise or cultivation taxes. (m) Business combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is obtained by the Company (see Note 2(c)). The Company measures the consideration transferred, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed in a business combination at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition related costs are recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred, and the services are received, except for the costs to issue debt or equity securities which are recognized according to specific requirements. The excess of the consideration transferred to obtain control, over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration for a business combination is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Contingent consideration that is classified as a liability is measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. If the acquiree’s former owners contractually indemnify the Company for a particular uncertainty, an indemnification asset is recognized on a basis that matches the indemnified item, subject to the contractual provisions or any collectability considerations. (n) Investments Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair value The Company accounted for its investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a valuation technique which maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs, with subsequent holding changes in fair value recognized in unrealized gain or loss on investments in the consolidated statement of loss. Investments in these types of securities are classified as Level 3 investments in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 21 – Financial Instruments and Risk Management for further discussion F-13 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Investment in associates and joint ventures The Company accounts for long-term equity investments in which it is able to exercise significant influence, but do not have control over, using the equity method. Investments accounted for using the equity method include investments in associates, and joint arrangements representing joint ventures. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but without control or joint control over those policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The Company accounts for its investments in associates and joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost, and subsequently adjusted for the Company’s share of the net income (loss), comprehensive income (loss) and distributions of the investee. The carrying value is assessed for impairment at each statement of financial position date. The Company recognized unrealized gains related to its investment in equity securities of $6,192 and $186 during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These amounts were included in other (expense) income in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. See Note 21 – Financial Instruments and Risk Management for further discussion (o) Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests (“NCI”) represents equity interests owned by outside parties. NCI may be initially measured at fair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The Company elected to measure acquired NCI at its fair value as of the acquisition date (refer to Note 2x(viii)). (p) Income taxes Income tax expense, consisting of current and deferred tax expense, is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at period-end, adjusted for amendments to tax payable with regard to previous years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related deferred income tax expense or recovery are recognized for deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realized, or the liability settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income (loss) in the period that substantive enactment occurs. A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized. To the extent that the Company does not consider it probable that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, the deferred tax asset is reduced. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. (q) Share capital Common shares Common shares are classified as equity. The proceeds from the exercise of stock options or warrants together with amounts previously recorded in reserves over the vesting periods are recorded as share capital. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. Equity units Proceeds received on the issuance of equity units comprised of common shares and warrants, such as convertible debentures and convertible preferred stock with detachable warrants, are allocated to common shares and warrants based on the relative fair value method. F-14 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) (r) Share based compensation The Company has a stock option plan in place. The Company measures equity settled share-based payments based on their fair value at the grant date and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In estimating fair value, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates such as the expected life of units, volatility of the Company’s future share price, risk free rates, expected forfeiture and future dividend yields at the initial grant date. Changes in assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in materially different results. Expected forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant, based on historical trends of actual option forfeitures, and subsequently adjusted if further information indicates actual forfeitures may vary from the original estimate. Any revisions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from management’s estimates, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period. Upon exercise of stock options and warrants that are classified as equity, any historical fair value in the warrants and share-based compensation reserve is allocated to additional paid in capital. Amounts recorded for expired unexercised stock options and warrants are transferred to deficit in the year of expiration. The fair value of restricted share units is based on the closing price of the Company’s stock as of the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, by amortizing the grant date fair value over the vesting period. (s) Convertible instruments The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities. Companies are required to bifurcate conversion options from their host instrument and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has been determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) as follows: the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption. The Company issued convertible debentures with detachable share purchase warrants at various times to raise capital to expand its business and support general corporate needs. The convertible instruments also included embedded derivatives in the form of conversion features and put options. Management evaluated the convertible debentures to determine the proper accounting and whether the embedded derivatives required bifurcation from the host instrument and whether the conversion feature was a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). It was concluded that the embedded derivative did not require bifurcation from the host instrument and that the conversion feature was not a BCF. The Company accounted for the convertible debentures and embedded derivatives as a single unit of account and classified them entirely as non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets in accordance with Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic ASC 470-20). The Company engaged a third-party to determine the fair value of each of the instruments issued and allocated the proceeds received from the issuance and the transaction costs related to the issuance of the convertible debentures and warrants based on their relative fair values as determined at issuance. F-15 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) (t) Convertible preferred stock and detachable warrants The Company evaluates convertible preferred stock in accordance with Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic ASC 470-20-35-7). All of the issued series preferred stock are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion ratio of one preferred share for 1,000 common shares. All series of convertible preferred stock are classified as shareholders’ equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the related preferred stock is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the day of issuance of the preferred stock. Included in the issuance were detachable warrants to purchase a convertible preferred share. The detachable purchase warrants were evaluated for equity or liability classification and were determined to meet liability classification. The warrants are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the convertible preferred shares. (u) Warrant liability The Company may issue common stock warrants with debt, equity or as a standalone financing instrument that is recorded as either liabilities or equity in accordance with the respective accounting guidance. Warrants recorded as equity are recorded at their relative fair value determined at the issuance date and remeasurement is not required. Warrants recorded as liabilities are recorded at their fair value, within warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets, and remeasured on each reporting date with changes recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. (v) Embedded derivative liabilities The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if those instruments or any embedded components of those instruments qualify as derivatives that need to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Embedded derivatives satisfying certain criteria are recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date with the change in the fair value recorded as income or expense. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event that requires the derivative liability to be reclassified to equity, the derivative liability is revalued to fair value at that date. (w) Earnings (loss) per share The Company presents basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated using the treasury stock method, by dividing the income (loss) attributable to common and proportionate shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common and proportionate voting shares outstanding during the period. Contingently issuable shares (including shares held in escrow) are not considered outstanding common shares and consequently are not included in the earnings (loss) per share calculations. The Company has the following categories of potentially dilutive common share equivalents: RSUs, stock options, warrants, convertible preferred shares, exchangeable shares and convertible debentures. In order to determine diluted earnings (loss) per share, it is assumed that any proceeds from the exercise of dilutive instruments would be used to repurchase common shares at the average market price during the period. The Company also considers all outstanding convertible securities, such as the convertible preferred shares, convertible debentures, and outstanding exchangeable shares as if the instruments were converted to the Company’s common stock. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is determined by adjusting the income (loss) attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common and proportionate voting shares outstanding, adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential common and proportionate voting shares. Proportionate voting shares are converted to their common share equivalent of one thousand common shares for every one proportionate voting share for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. In a period of losses, all of the potentially dilutive common share equivalents are excluded in the determination of dilutive net loss per share because their effect is antidilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 27,652,010 potentially dilutive common share equivalents were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no potentially dilutive common share equivalents were included in the computation of diluted loss per share because their impact would have been anti-dilutive. F-16 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) (x) Use of significant estimates and judgments The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Management has applied significant estimates and judgements related to the following: i) Inventory The net realizable value of inventory represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment, including consideration of factors such as shrinkage, the aging of and future demand for inventory, expected future selling price the Company expects to realize by selling the inventory, and the contractual arrangements with customers. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based upon quantities on hand, projected volumes from demand forecasts and net realizable value. The future realization of these inventories may be affected by market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. A change to these assumptions could impact the Company’s inventory valuation and gross profit. The impact of inventory reserves is reflected in cost of sales. ii) Revenue recognition From time to time, the Company partakes in sales agreements with suppliers in which it also purchases inventory. As part of the five-step revenue model, the Company assesses whether instances of bulk sales made to suppliers of goods have commercial substance and should be recognized as revenue, or whether they should be assessed under ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions , which requires management judgment to determine if the transaction has commercial substance . iii) Share based payments In calculating share-based compensation expense, key estimates are used such as, the rate of forfeiture of options granted, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the Company’s stock price, and the risk-free interest rate. iv) Warrant Liability In calculating the fair value of warrants issued, the Company includes key estimates such as the volatility of the Company’s stock price and the risk-free interest rate. The Company uses judgment to select methods used and in performing the fair value calculations at the initial measurement at issuance, as well as for subsequent measurement on a recurring basis. v) Income taxes The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized is based on an assessment of the probability of the Company generating future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized. In addition, significant judgment is required in classifying transactions and assessing probable outcomes of tax positions taken, and in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties in various tax jurisdictions. F-17 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. It is possible, however, that at some future date, an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. If the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. vi) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit are less than its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The Company uses an income-based approach as necessary to assess the fair values of intangible assets and its reporting units for goodwill testing purposes. Under the income approach, fair value is based on the present value of estimated cash flows. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the most recent information available. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Determining the value in use requires the Company to estimate expected future cash flows associated with the assets and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts, and market data are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and intangible assets. vii) Impairment of long-lived assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, ROU assets, and definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. viii) Business combinations Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or an asset acquisition depends on whether the asset acquired constitutes a business, which can be a complex judgement. The Company has determined that its acquisitions in Note 4 are business combinations under ASC 805 Business Combinations . In a business combination, substantially all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. One of the most significant areas of judgment and estimation relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities, including the fair value of contingent consideration, if applicable. If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, the Company may utilize an independent external valuation expert to develop the fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, which are generally based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. These valuations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in the discount rate applied. The Company elected to measure each NCI at its fair value as of the acquisition date based on an appraisal of the real estate acquired using the market approach, specifically the direct comparison approach of comparable properties. F-18 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) ix) Contingent Consideration Contingent consideration payable as the result of a business combination is recorded at the date of acquisition at fair value. The fair value of contingent consideration is subject to significant judgement and estimates, such as projected future revenue. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are measured at each reporting date, with changes recognized through profit or loss. x) Incremental borrowing rates Lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available. If that rate cannot be easily determined, the lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company estimates it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The Company calculates its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate the Company would pay to borrow funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value over similar terms taking into consideration the economic factors and the credit risk rating at the commencement date of the lease. In addition, the Company utilizes a discount rate to determine the appropriate fair value of convertible debentures and loans issued with warrants attached. The discount rate applied reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount at a similar term and with a similar security. xi) Control, joint control or level of influence When determining the appropriate basis of accounting for the Company’s interests in affiliates, the Company makes judgments about the degree of influence that it exerts directly or through an arrangement over the investees’ relevant activities. xii) COVID-19 Estimation Uncertainty In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. Government measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, including the closure of non-essential businesses, did not materially disrupt the Company’s operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. The production and sale of cannabis have been recognized as essential services across Canada and the US and the Company has not experienced production delays or prolonged retail closures as a result. Management has been closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and has implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including enhanced cleaning protocols and implementing social distancing measures. In April 2020, to mitigate patient and caregiver concerns, the Company’s Ilera operations implemented a curbside service at its dispensaries to promote social distancing. Additionally, the Company’s Apothecarium business launched a delivery service in California. Due to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, it is not possible to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on the business, financial position, and operating results in the future. In addition, it is possible that estimates in the Company’s financial statements will change in the near term as a result of COVID-19 and the effect of any such changes could be material, which could result in, among other things, impairment of long-lived assets including intangibles and goodwill. Management is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business. At December 31, 2021, management has not observed any material impairments of assets or significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (y) New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted (i) In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2021 and notes that it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. F-19 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) (ii) In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments – Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (“ASU 2020-01”), which is intended to clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in Topic 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounting for under Topic 815. The Company adopted this standard January 1, 2021 and notes that it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. (iii) On August 5, 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt- Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, to improve financial reporting associated with accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard January 1, 2021 and notes that it does not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. (y) New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted (i) In October 2021, the FASB issued ASC No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 3.

Acquisitions 2021 Acquisitions New Jersey Partnership On August 20, 2021, the Company purchased an additional 12.5%, with an option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership, of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ from BWH NJ, LLC and Blue Marble Ventures, LLC for a total consideration of $50,000, which was paid during the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon closing of the agreement, the Company now owns 87.5% of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ. The Company has the option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership, for a total of 93.75%, at a predetermined valuation during the period commencing April 1, 2023 through June 15, 2023. The purchase option derivative asset was measured at fair value at the date of transaction using the Monte Carlo simulation model, and subsequently remeasured at December 31, 2021 and has been classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 21 for discussion regarding changes in fair value of the purchase option derivative asset, as well as the key inputs and assumptions used in the model. The purchase option derivative is included in other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. This transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the non-controlling interest was adjusted by $1,406 to reflect the change in the net book value ownership interest in TerrAscend. The difference from the consideration paid of $47,472 is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the parent’s equity holders. F-21 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Acquisition of HMS On May 3, 2021, the Company acquired HMS Health, LLC (“HMS Health”) and HMS Processing, LLC (“HMS Processing” and together with HMS Health “HMS”), a cultivator and processor of medical cannabis products in the state of Maryland. TerrAscend acquired 100% of the equity of HMS Health and the rights to acquire 100% of the equity of HMS Processing post-closing following receipt of certain regulatory approvals, for total consideration of $24,488, comprised of $22,399 in cash and a $2,089 note, which bears 5.0% annual interest, due April 2022. 100% of HMS’ economics is retained by the Company through full ownership of HMS Health and a master services agreement with HMS Processing. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. On a standalone basis, had the Company acquired the business on January 1, 2021, sales estimates would have been $10,209 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and net loss estimates would have been $4,915. Actual sales and net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 since the date of acquisition are $6,797 and $3,272, respectively. The following table presents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the May 3, 2021 acquisition date and an allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: Receivables $ 758 Inventory 4,725 Prepaid expenses and deposits 68 Operating right-of-use asset 1,660 Property and equipment 756 Intangible assets 19,750 Goodwill 8,877 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (1,098 ) Lease liability (1,660 ) Corporate income tax payable (1,195 ) Deferred tax liability (8,153 ) Net assets acquired $ 24,488 Consideration paid in cash $ 22,399 Promissory note payable 2,089 Total consideration $ 24,488 Cash outflow $ 22,399 The consideration paid reflected the benefit of expected sales growth, future market conditions, and product development. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Costs related to this transaction were $69, including legal, accounting, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses, and were included in transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. F-22 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Acquisition of KCR Upon the acquisition of Ilera on September 16, 2019, the Company acquired a $1,000 investment in GuadCo LLC and KCR Holdings LLC (collectively “KCR”). KCR holds a permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Health which grants the right to operate three dispensaries in the state of Pennsylvania. The Company’s investment represented a 10% equity share in KCR. The Company had significant influence over KCR as the Company’s Ilera business supplies a significant portion of inventory, and therefore, the investment in KCR was accounted for using the equity method and was included in investment in associate on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquisition was adjusted for earnings and cash distributions. On April 30, 2021, the investment had a carrying value of $1,223. The fair value of the investment on April 30, 2021 was estimated to be $7,101, which was implied based on the overall purchase price. An unrealized gain of $5,878 was recorded and included in the unrealized and realized gain on investments and notes receivable in the statement of operations. On April 30, 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 90% of equity of KCR for total consideration of $69,847, comprised of $34,427 in common shares, $20,506 in cash, $7,101 related to the fair value of previously owned shares, and a $6,750 note which bears 10.0% annual interest, due April 2022. The transaction added three retail dispensaries located in Bethlehem, Allentown and Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania to complement the Company’s existing retail footprint in Southeastern Pennsylvania. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The Company will pay up to $6,300 in shares if (i) within two years of the closing date, legislation is enacted into law by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which permits the cultivation, processing and/or sale of adult use cannabis; and (ii) the legislation provides that any Pennsylvania medical marijuana dispensary permit holder existing on the date of enactment of the legislation may be issued an additional adult-use dispensing organization permit (or similar permit) to operate at least three locations to serve adult use purchasers in Pennsylvania; and (iii) if as a result of the legislation, within three years of the date the legislation is enacted and effective, the Company commences retail sales at an additional two dispensaries under, through or on account of the GuadCo license or any other Pennsylvania license acquired from a third-party after the closing date. The total value of the potential purchase consideration payable by the Company under the terms of the agreement is approximately $75,084, and the fair value of the contingent consideration was $1,063 at acquisition. On a standalone basis, had the Company acquired the business on January 1, 2021, sales estimates would have been $30,547 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and net income estimates would have been $5,171. Actual sales and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 since the date of acquisition are $20,588 and $3,485, respectively. The following table presents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the April 30, 2021 acquisition date and an allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: F-23 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Cash and cash equivalents $ 169 Inventory 2,461 Prepaid expenses and other assets 559 Operating right-of-use asset 2,176 Property and equipment 4,237 Intangible assets 49,228 Goodwill 13,660 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (479 ) Lease liability (2,164 ) Net assets acquired $ 69,847 Consideration paid in cash $ 20,506 Consideration paid in shares 34,427 Promissory note payable 6,750 Contingent consideration payable 1,063 Fair value in previously owned shares 7,101 Total consideration $ 69,847 Cash and cash equivalents acquired, net cash inflow $ 20,337 The consideration paid reflected the benefit of expected sales growth, future market and product development, synergies and workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Costs related to this transaction were $237, including legal, accounting, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses, and were included in transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 2020 Acquisitions Acquisition of ABI SF, LLC (“State Flower”) On January 23, 2020, the Company, acquired 49.9% of the equity of State Flower through conversion of the note principal and accrued interest into 4,880.44 Class B units of State Flower. The Company agreed to purchase the remaining 50.1% of equity of State Flower under a Securities Purchase Agreement at a future date to be determined for total consideration based on future sales over a predetermined period. The Company also extended State Flower a separate line of credit of up to $4,500 for cultivation facility improvements to expand its production capacity. As of December 31, 2020, the full amount was drawn on the line of credit. The Company consolidates State Flower into its financial statements beginning on the date it obtained a controlling financial interest, which was the conversion date. F-24 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) As consideration, the Company converted its previously issued note receivable and accrued interest in the amount of $3,032 into a 49.9% equity interest in State Flower. As part of this transaction, the Company entered into a put/call arrangement with the State Flower principals. As a result, the non-controlling interest in State Flower does not qualify for equity treatment. Under the put/call arrangement, the non-controlling interest is redeemable by either party to the agreement after certain regulatory approvals are met. The Company has classified the non-controlling interest as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as contingent consideration payable. The initial 50.1% non-controlling interest liability was recorded at fair value of $6,630, representing the expected consideration payable to acquire the remaining 50.1% of State Flower, which comprises 100% of its Class A common shares, subject to regulatory approval. The contingent consideration is based on a multiple of future revenue less the total principal amount drawn under the line of credit and discounted using an appropriate risk adjusted rate. Any fair value adjustments to the liability are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. No profit or loss with respect to State Flower operations is allocated to the non-controlling interests. Effective with the conversion, the Company controls the appointment of three out of five seats on the board of directors and controls strategic and financial operations of State Flower. On a standalone basis had the Company acquired the business on January 1, 2020, sales estimates would have been $2,192 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and net loss estimates would have been $1,568. Actual sales and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 since the date of acquisition are $1,871 and $1,564, respectively. The following table presents the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and an allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: Cash and cash equivalents $ 739 Receivables 106 Inventory 432 Prepaid expenses and deposits 139 Operating right-of-use assets 2,734 Property and equipment 1,215 Intangible assets 4,770 Goodwill 4,689 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (378 ) Lease liability (2,734 ) Net assets acquired $ 11,712 Consideration paid on conversion of note receivable $ 3,032 Contingent consideration payable 6,630 Line of credit advances at date of acquisition 2,050 Total consideration $ 11,712 Cash and cash equivalents acquired, net cash inflow $ 739 Goodwill was recognized for this acquisition because the purchase consideration included a control premium. In addition, the consideration paid reflected the benefit of expected sales growth and future market and product development. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Costs related to this transaction were $43, including legal, accounting, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses and were included in transaction and restructuring costs. F-25 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Contingent consideration Contingent consideration recorded relates to the Company’s business acquisitions. Contingent consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the terms of the agreement. The determination of the fair value of the contingent consideration payable is primarily based on the Company’s expectations of the amount of revenue to be achieved by the underlying business units within a specified time period based on the agreement. Refer to Note 21 for further discussion surrounding the fair value of the contingent consideration. The balance of contingent consideration is as follows: State Flower Ilera Apothecarium KCR Total Carrying amount, December 31, 2019 $ — $ 156,373 $ 3,028 $ — $ 159,401 Contingent consideration recognized on acquisition 6,630 — — — 6,630 Payments of contingent consideration — (147,184 ) — — (147,184 ) Revaluation of contingent consideration (40 ) 18,749 — — 18,709 Carrying amount, December 31, 2020 6,590 27,938 3,028 — 37,556 Amount recognized on acquisition of KCR — — — 1,063 1,063 Payments of contingent consideration — (29,668 ) — — (29,668 ) Revaluation of contingent consideration 1,770 1,730 — 84 3,584 Carrying amount, December 31, 2021 $ 8,360 $ — $ 3,028 $ 1,147 $ 12,535 Less: current portion (6,954 ) — (3,028 ) — (9,982 ) Non-current contingent consideration $ 1,406 $ — $ — $ 1,147 $ 2,553 The contingent consideration for State Flower was calculated based on fiscal year 2021 revenue and as of December 31, 2021, the final earnout has been calculated. The Company will make a payment of $6,954 in January 2022. The remaining amount will be paid to the sellers of State Flower upon the Company’s acquisition of the remaining 50.1% of State Flower. On September 4, 2020, the Company and the sellers of Ilera amended the Ilera Purchase Agreement to allow the Company to utilize cash flow generated by the Ilera business to prepay up to $30,000 (the “Pre-Payment Amount”) towards the final earnout payment. The amendment also allows the Company to defer up to an amount equal to the actual Pre-Payment Amount paid to the sellers of Ilera until June 30, 2021. The contingent consideration was calculated based on fiscal year 2019 and 2020 performance. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made payments to the sellers of Ilera totaling $147,184. The remaining amount of $29,668 was paid on June 30, 2021. Refer to Note 21 for discussion of valuation methods used when determining the fair value of the contingent consideration liability, and the changes in fair value. 5. Inventory The Company’s inventory of dry cannabis and oil includes both purchased and internally produced inventory. The Company’s inventory is comprised of the following items: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Raw materials $ 3,185 $ 3,777 Finished goods 8,721 8,750 Work in process 26,852 5,519 Accessories 74 81 Supplies and consumables 3,491 2,434 $ 42,323 $ 20,561 F-26 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) The inventory change is mainly due to an increase in distillate being held for the processing of manufactured products in Pennsylvania. In addition, in New Jersey, the Company has made a strategic decision to build up inventory for its own dispensaries in advance of expected adult-use transition by the end of Q2 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded impairment of $2,322, related to aged, obsolete, or unsaleable inventories at its Canada and Florida operations. Additionally, the Company recorded impairment of $1,889 at its Pennsylvania operations related to inventory that did not meet its quality standards. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded inventory impairments of $4,111 and $6,956, respectively, relating to raw materials and Cannabis products (finished goods) exceeding the net realizable value. Management determines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Of the impairment charges during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $1,795 of the charges were related to write down of inventory purchased from a third-party supplier, during the current period, at prices per prior signed agreements. The impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2019 were due to the carrying value of inventory exceeding the estimated net realizable value. In addition, management wrote off $730, $1,261, and $3,849 of inventory that it deemed unsaleable for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Inventory impairment and write-offs have been recorded in cost of sales. 6. Property and equipment, net Property and equipment consisted of: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Land $ 4,183 $ 3,640 Assets in process 6,858 2,275 Buildings & improvements 117,703 92,672 Machinery & equipment 23,424 15,862 Office furniture & production equipment 3,232 2,742 Assets under finance leases 239 239 Total cost 155,639 117,430 Less: accumulated depreciation (14,877 ) (7,185 ) Property and equipment, net $ 140,762 $ 110,245 Assets in process represent construction in progress related to both cultivation and dispensary facilities not yet completed, or otherwise not placed in service. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, borrowing costs were not capitalized because the assets in process did not meet the criteria of a qualifying asset. Depreciation expense was $8,322 for the year ended December 31, 2021 ($5,682 included in cost of sales), $4,658 for the year ended December 31, 2020 ($2,670 included in cost of sales), and $1,164 for the year ended December 31, 2019 ($735 included in cost of sales). Asset Specific Impairment The Company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment at each reporting period for indicators of impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company determined that equipment purchased for the purpose of extracting CBD and THC oils to support the medical cannabis business in Canada needed to be assessed for impairment as the equipment was never put into use and the Company has since exited the medical cannabis business in Canada. The Company evaluated the recoverability of the asset to determine whether it would be recoverable, and it was determined that the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows and therefore, recorded an impairment loss of $470. The F-27 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Company determined that the assets meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and the remaining net book value of $343 was included in other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made a strategic decision to cease the growing and cultivation of cannabis in Canada. As a result of this decision, the Company wrote down the net book value of the lighting and irrigation assets previously used in the Canadian cultivation business to $nil and recognized asset specific impairment of $823. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company determined that Solace Rx’s proposed Drug Preparation Premise (“DPP”) was no longer commercially viable and ceased all further construction and operations, which was determined to be an indicator of impairment. The fair value of the DPP was determined based on a third-party appraisal. As a result, the Company recorded impairment of property and equipment of $1,746 for the DPP. 7. Intangible assets , net and goodwill Intangible assets consisted of the following: At December 31, 2021 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Finite lived intangible assets Software $ 2,626 $ (1,353 ) $ 1,273 Licenses 153,300 (11,311 ) 141,989 Brand intangibles 1,144 (254 ) 890 Non-compete agreements 280 (221 ) 59 Total finite lived intangible assets 157,350 (13,139 ) 144,211 Indefinite lived intangible assets Brand intangibles 24,773 — 24,773 Total indefinite lived intangible assets 24,773 — 24,773 Intangible assets, net $ 182,123 $ (13,139 ) $ 168,984 At December 31, 2020 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Finite lived intangible assets Software $ 2,447 $ (733 ) $ 1,714 Licenses 85,302 (5,511 ) 79,791 Customer relationships 4,000 (1,601 ) 2,399 Non-compete agreements 1,630 (997 ) 633 Total finite lived intangible assets 93,379 (8,842 ) 84,537 Indefinite lived intangible assets Brand intangibles 26,173 — 26,173 Total indefinite lived intangible assets 26,173 — 26,173 Intangible assets, net $ 119,552 $ (8,842 ) $ 110,710 The gross carrying amount of intangible assets increased $62,571 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was mainly a result of business combinations, which accounted for $68,978 of the increases during the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by impairment of intangible assets of $3,633. Amortization expense was $7,068 for the year ended December 31, 2021 ($2,052 included in cost of sales), $5,775 for the year ended December 31, 2020 ($2,201 included in cost of sales), and $3,280 for the year ended December 31, 2019 ($642 included in cost of sales). F-28 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Estimated future amortization expense for finite lived intangible assets for the next five years is as follows: 2022 $ 7,814 2023 6,818 2024 6,383 2025 5,960 2026 5,927 Impairment of Intangible Assets The Company recorded the following impairment losses by category of intangible assets: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Finite lived intangible assets Software $ 9 $ 1 $ 113 Licenses — 423 268 Customer relationships 2,000 342 — Non-compete agreements 224 — — Total impairment of finite lived intangible assets 2,233 766 381 Indefinite lived intangible assets Brand intangibles 1,400 — 2,928 Total impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 1,400 — 2,928 Total impairment of intangible assets $ 3,633 $ 766 $ 3,309 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made the decision to undertake a strategic review process to explore, review, and evaluate potential alternatives for its Arise business. The Company also determined that the estimated future cash flows for the business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill, and therefore, the intangible assets and goodwill were written down to $nil. The Company recorded impairment of intangible assets of $3,633 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company recorded impairment of $423 of intellectual property in Canada during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to packaging designs that were written down to its recoverable value. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment of $342 related to its customer relationships at Arise as a result of its termination of an agreement with one of its wholesale distributors. At the end of each reporting period, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. For any reporting units in which it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the Company tests its indefinite useful life for impairment by comparing its carrying amount with its fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized impairment losses of $2,928 related to the brand intangible asset at its California business. The fair value of the brand was calculated using a relief of royalty method. The following table summarizes the activity in the Company’s goodwill balance: Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 68,107 Acquisitions (see Note 4) 4,689 Balance at December 31, 2020 72,796 Acquisitions (see Note 4) 22,537 Impairment of goodwill (5,007 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 90,326 F-29 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Impairment of Goodwill During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company qualitatively assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair values of its reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. If it was determined that it was more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value was less than its carrying amount, a one-step quantitative impairment test was performed. The following significant assumptions are applied in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units: • Cash flows: estimated cash flows were projected based on actual operating results from internal sources, as well as industry and market trends. The forecasts were extended to a total of five years (with a terminal value thereafter); • Terminal value growth rate: The terminal growth rate was based on historical and projected consumer price inflation, historical and projected economic indicators and projected industry growth; • Post-tax discount rate: The post-tax discount rate is reflective of the reporting units weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”). The WACC was estimated based on the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, beta premium, and after-tax cost of debt based on corporate bond yields; and • Tax rate: the tax rates used in determining the future cash flows were those substantively enacted at the respective valuation date As a result of the Company’s decision to undertake a strategic review of its Arise business, Company recorded impairment of goodwill of $5,007 during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill for each of its reporting units. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California and Maryland reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was performed. The Company performed a quantitative analysis over its Pennsylvania reporting unit and determined that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Pennsylvania reporting unit was $76,761 at December 31, 2021. There is no goodwill at the Company’s Canada and New Jersey reporting units. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill for each of its reporting units. It was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California and Pennsylvania reporting units exceed their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was performed. The Company performed a quantitative analysis over its Florida reporting unit and determined that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Florida reporting unit was $5,007 at December 31, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of the Company’s qualitative analyses performed, it was determined that the fair values of its Canada and California reporting units were more likely than not less than the respective carrying values, and therefore, the Company performed a one-step impairment test for each reporting unit. The Company’s Canada reporting unit includes its operations dedicated to the research and development of cannabis biotechnology, including the development of novel formulations and delivery forms, the reconstitution, dilution and preparation of drug preparations for health care practitioners and institutions, and the sale and distribution of medical cannabis. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company shut down its drug preparation facility as management deemed that market conditions did not support the operations of this business. As a result, sales forecasts were updated to $nil. Management obtained a third-party appraisal to determine the reporting units fair value using the direct comparison cost approach of comparable properties and applied it against the carrying amount. As a result of the impairment test, management concluded that the carrying value was higher than the fair value and recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of $1,825. The Company’s California reporting unit represents its operations dedicated to the sale of cannabis products and accessories at retail dispensaries within the state of California. During the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the quantitative impairment test performed, management concluded that the carrying value was higher than the fair value of the reporting unit and recorded impairment losses of $43,977.

Shareholders’ equity The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares, proportionate voting shares, exchangeable shares, and preferred shares. The Company’s board of directors have the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges, and liquidation preferences, of each class of the Company’s capital stock. Unlimited Number of Preferred Shares The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to issue an unlimited number of preferred shares in Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D convertible preferred shares (the “Convertible Preferred Shares”). The preferred shares of each series will, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, rank on parity with the preferred shares of every other series and be entitled to preference over the Proportionate Voting Shares, Common Shares and Exchange Shares. Voting Rights Holders of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive notice of, or to attend or to vote at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company. Dividends The holders of the Convertible Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive any dividends, except that if the Company issues a dividend when necessary to comply with contractual provisions in respect of an adjustment to the conversion ratio in connection with any dividend paid on the Common Shares. F-36 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Conversion Rights Holders of the Company’s Convertible Preferred Shares are entitled to convert each outstanding share to 1,000 common shares of the Company (or the economic equivalent in proportionate voting shares for US investors) at the option of the holder, subject to customary anti-dilution provisions. The Convertible Preferred Shares will be automatically converted into proportionate voting shares at the then-effective conversion ratio, instead of being redeemed for cash and other assets, in the event of a change in control. Redemption Rights The Company classified the Convertible Preferred Shares as permanent equity in the financial statements given that the terms do not obligate the Company to buy back the shares of preferred stock in exchange for cash or other assets, nor do the shares represent an obligation that must or may be settled with a variable number of shares, which are debt-like features. No other redemption provisions exist within the terms of the instrument. Liquidation Preference In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or upon any other return of capital or distribution of the assets of the Company among its shareholders, in each case for the purposes of winding up its affairs, each Convertible Preferred Share entitles the holder thereof to receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution, before any distribution or payment may be made to a holder of any Common Shares, Proportionate Voting Shares, Exchangeable Shares or any other shares ranking junior in such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up to the Convertible Preferred Shares, an amount per Convertible Preferred Share equal to the fair market value of the consideration paid for such preferred share upon issuance. The Company’s Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D convertible preferred shares have a liquidation preference that is initially equal to $2,000, $2,000, $3,000 and $3,000, respectively, per share; provided that if the Company makes a distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the respective series of Convertible Preferred Shares, or if the Company effects a share split or share consolidation of the respective series of Convertible Preferred Shares, then the liquidation preference will then be adjusted on the effective date of such event by a rate computed as (i) the number of respective series of Convertible Preferred Shares outstanding immediately before giving effect to such event divided by (ii) the number of respective series of Convertible Preferred Shares outstanding immediately after such event. After payment to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Shares of the full liquidation preference to which they are entitled in respect of outstanding Convertible Preferred Shares (which, for greater certainty), have not been converted prior to such payment), such Convertible Preferred Shares will have no further right or claim to any of the assets of the Company. The liquidation preference will be payable to holders of Convertible Preferred Shares in cash; provided, however, that to the extent the Company has, having exercised commercially reasonable efforts to make such payment, insufficient cash available to pay the liquidation preference in full in cash, the portion of the Liquidation Preference with respect to which the Company has insufficient cash may be paid in property or other assets of the Company. The value of any property or assets not consisting of cash that is distributed by the Company in satisfaction of any portion of the liquidation preference will equal the fair market value on the date of distribution. As of December 31, 2021, the Convertible Preferred Series A and B Shares have an aggregate liquidation value of $28,686, or $2,000 per share. The Convertible Preferred Series C Shares have an aggregate liquidation value of $108, or $3,000 per share. Unlimited Number of Proportionate Voting Shares Holders of Proportionate Voting Shares are entitled to receive, as and when declared by the Board, dividends in cash or property of the Company.

Holders of Proportionate Voting Shares are not entitled to a right of first refusal to subscribe for, purchase or receive any part of any issue of shares, or bonds, debentures or other securities of the Company. There may be no subdivision or consolidation of the Proportionate Voting Shares unless, simultaneously, the Common Shares and Exchangeable Shares are subdivided or consolidated using the same divisor or multiplier. Proportionate Voting Shares carry 1,000 votes per share, are entitled to participate in dividends and in the distribution of proceeds on a wind-up of the Company on a $1,000-to-$1.00 basis relative to the Common Shares. Each Proportionate Voting Share is exchangeable into 1,000 Common Shares. Unlimited Number of Exchangeable Shares Voting Rights The holders of Exchangeable Shares will not be entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at meetings of the shareholders of the Company; provided that the holders of Exchangeable Shares will, however, be entitled to receive notice of meetings of shareholders called for the purpose of authorizing the dissolution of the Company or the sale of its assets, or a substantial part thereof, but holders of Exchangeable Shares will not be entitled to vote at such meeting of the shareholders of the Company. Dividends The holders of the Exchanges Shares will not be entitled to receive any dividends. Dissolution In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of assets of the Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up its affairs, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will not be entitled to receive any amount, property or assets of the Company.

Dividend Rights The holders of the Common Shares are entitled to receive, subject to the rights of the holder of any other class of shares, any dividends declared by the Company. If, as and when dividends are declared by the directors, each Common Share will be entitled to 0.001 times the amount paid or distributed per Proportionate Voting Share (or, if a stock dividend is declared, each Common Share will be entitled to receive the same number of Common Shares per Common Share of Proportionate Voting Shares entitled to be received per Proportionate Voting Share). F-38 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Dissolution In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of assets of the Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up its affairs, the holders of the Common Shares will, subject to the rights of any other class of shares, be entitled to receive the remaining property of the Company on the basis that each Common Share will be entitled to 0.001 times the amount distributed per Proportionate Voting Share, but otherwise there is no preference or distinction among or between the Proportionate Voting Shares and the Common Shares. Conversion Rights Each issued and outstanding Common Share may at any time, at the option of the holder, be converted into 0.001 of a Proportionate Voting Share.

Common shares issued for compensation On March 25, 2020, the Company issued 1,625,701 common shares to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of NJ, pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses in the state of New Jersey to NJ. Stock Options The Company’s Board of Directors approved the Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”) effective March 8, 2017. The Plan provides for the granting of stock options to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company. Stock options are granted for a term not to exceed ten years at an exercise price, which is the greater of the closing market price of the shares on the CSE on the trading day immediately preceding the date the options are granted and on the same day of the option grant. The options are not transferrable. The Plan is administered by the Board of Directors, which determines individual eligibility under the Plan, number of shares reserved for optioning to each individual (not to exceed 5% of issued and outstanding shares to any one individual) and the vesting period. The maximum number of shares of the Company that are issuable pursuant to the Plan is limited to 10% of the fully diluted shares of the Company at the date of the grant of options. The stock options outstanding noted below consist of service-based options granted to employees to purchase common stock, the majority of which vest over a one to three-year period and have a five to ten-year contractual term. These awards are subject to the risk of forfeiture until vested by virtue of continued employment or service to the Company.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between Company’s closing stock price at the end of the period and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of the in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their in-the-money options on December 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the market price of the Company’s common stock on the exercise date and the price paid by the options to exercise the option) related to stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $6,667, $10,123, and $2,923, respectively. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $14,840, $9,035, and $5,387, respectively. The fair value of the various stock options granted were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Volatility 79.05% - 81.51% 82.29% - 87.09% 88.04% - 96.98% Risk-free interest rate 0.90% - 1.72% 0.35% - 1.60% 1.15% - 1.96% Expected life (years) 4.57 - 10.05 4.76 - 4.95 5.00 Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on US treasury bond issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company F-43 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company applied a forfeiture rate ranging between 23.21%-26.60% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Restricted Share Units Effective November 19, 2019, the Company adopted the Share Unit Plan, which allows for the granting of performance share units (PSUs) and restricted share units (RSUs) to directors, officers, employees, and consultants of the Company and provides them the opportunity to defer certain compensation and equity awards paid or grated for their service in the form of stock units (“Stock Units”). The Stock Units are used solely as a device for determining the amount of cash benefit to eventually be paid to the grantee. Each Stock Unit has the same value as one share of the Company’s common stock. The PSUs generally become vested upon attainment of established performance conditions, as well as service conditions. The RSUs generally become vested upon completion of continuous employment over the requisite service period. The following table summarizes the activities for the RSUs: Number of RSUs Number of RSUs vested Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) Outstanding, December 31, 2019 — — — Granted 280,099 Vested (157,788 ) Forfeited (1) — Outstanding, December 31, 2020 122,311 33,733 N/A Granted 174,408 Vested (40,665 ) Forfeited (1) (63,883 ) Outstanding, December 31, 2021 192,171 13,294 N/A Of the RSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2021, 43,385 will vest over a 3-year term and 131,023 will vest over a 4-year term. Of the RSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2020, 191,521 vested on the grant date. The remaining will vest over a 4-year term. The Company recognized $954, $686, and $nil as share-based payment expense during the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, there was $1,705 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. 1 3 .

Each warrant is exercisable at $5.41 per 0.001 share and expires at 36 months from the respective closing date. The warrants resulted in a reduction in share capital of $22.457. The Proportionate Voting Shares remain outstanding at December 31, 2021. • On August 30, 2019, certain funds managed by JW Asset Management LLC exercised an aggregate 28,636,361 warrants to acquire 28,636.361 Proportionate Voting Shares which are convertible into 28,636,361 Common Shares for an aggregate amount of $31,500. • Through the private placements during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued 33,130 Common Shares at a price of C$7.64 per Common Share to employees and Directors of the Company.

The following table presents a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Balance at beginning of period $ 12,008 $ 14,830 Increase based on tax positions related to prior periods 4,884 780 Decreases based on tax positions related to prior periods (4,546 ) (3,602 ) Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (3,028 ) — Balance at end of period $ 9,318 $ 12,008 F-46 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as components of the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, we had interest accrued of approximately $1,071, and $1,479, respectively. The principal component of deferred taxes are as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Deferred tax assets Net operating losses $ 26,321 $ 19,286 Share issuance costs 700 498 Property and equipment 2,038 1,585 Intangible assets 4,101 1,895 Other 1,696 962 Total deferred tax assets 34,856 24,226 Valuation allowance (24,097 ) (12,905 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 10,759 $ 11,321 Deferred tax liabilities Convertible Debentures $ (10,065 ) $ (11,271 ) Intangible assets (14,963 ) (7,880 ) Other — (107 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ (25,028 ) $ (19,258 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ (14,269 ) $ (7,937 ) The Company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate if it is more likely than not to use certain jurisdiction-based deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryovers. On the basis of this assessment, a valuation allowance was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has $79,826 of Canadian net operating loss carryovers that expire at different times, the earliest of which is 2034 for $546. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has $9,876 of domestic federal net operating loss carryovers with no expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has various state net operating loss carryovers that expire at different times. The statute of limitations with respect to our federal returns remains open for tax years 2018 and forward. For certain acquired subsidiaries, the federal statue remains open with respect to tax years 2014 and forward. Certain acquired subsidiaries are under IRS audit for tax years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2015, in which upon acquisition the seller set aside cash in an escrow account to be used on future tax indemnifications. As of December 31, 2021, indemnification asset of $3,969 has been recorded. The Company does not expect that resolution of these examinations will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial position, but could have a significant impact on the consolidated results of operations for the period in which resolution occurs. Over the next twelve months, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that various tax examinations will be concluded and statutes of limitation will expire which would have the effect of reducing the balance of unrecognized tax benefits by $2,500. As the Company operates in the cannabis industry, it is subject to the limitations of IRC Section 280E, under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-deductible under IRC Section 280E. Therefore, the effective tax rate can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income or loss.

Capital management The Company’s objective in managing capital is to ensure a sufficient liquidity position to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order to achieve this objective, the Company prepares a capital budget to manage its capital structure. The Company defines capital as borrowings, equity comprised of issued share capital, share-based payments, accumulated deficit, as well as funds borrowed from related parties. Since inception, the Company has primarily financed its liquidity needs through the issuance of share capital and debt. The equity issuances are outlined in Note 11 and debt issuances are outlined in Note 8. The Company is subject to financial covenants as a result of its loans payable with various lenders. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2021. In the event that, in future periods, the Company’s financial results are below levels required to maintain compliance with any of its covenants, the Company will assess and undertake appropriate corrective initiatives with a view to allowing it to continue to comply with its covenants. Other than these items related to loans payable, the Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 2 1 . Financial instruments and risk management Assets and liabilities measured at fair value Financial instruments recorded at fair value are estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities F-49 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Level 2- inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) from observable market data Level 3- inputs for assets and liabilities not based upon observable market data Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. The following table summarizes the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020: At December 31, 2021 At December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 79,642 $ — $ — $ 59,226 $ — $ — Purchase option derivative asset — — 868 — — — Total Assets $ 79,642 $ — $ 868 $ 59,226 $ — $ — Liabilities Contingent consideration payable $ — $ — $ 12,535 $ — $ — $ 37,556 Warrant liability — 54,986 — — 132,257 — Total Liabilities $ — $ 54,986 $ 12,535 $ — $ 132,257 $ 37,556 There were no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. The valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are presented below. Level 1 Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. Level 2 Investments The Company accounted for its investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a valuation technique which maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs, with subsequent holding changes in fair value recognized in unrealized gain or loss on investments in the consolidated statement of loss. The Company recognized unrealized gains related to its investment in equity securities of $6,192 and $186 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. F-50 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) W arrant liability The following table summarizes the changes in the preferred share warrant liability for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: Balance at December 31, 2019 $ — Initial fair value measurement of warrant liability 22,953 Included in loss on fair value of warrants 110,518 Exercises (1,214 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 132,257 Included in loss on fair value of warrants (58,158 ) Exercises (19,113 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 54,986 The preferred share warrant liability has been measured at fair value at issuance date using the Black Scholes simulation model which requires unobservable measures and other fair value inputs. The fair value of the warrant liability at the date of issuance was $22,953. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes simulation valuation model used at the private placement dates are summarized below: May 22, 2020 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp.* $ 1.94 Unit Issue Price $ 2,000.0 Warrant Exercise Price $ 3,000.0 Initial Conversion Ratio 1,000 Annual Volatility 76.8 % Annual Risk-Free Rate 0.2 % Term 3 year *Fair value input was based on the weighted-average closing price for the Company’s common stock, based on all issuance dates for the Units described in Note 11 . The warrant liability was remeasured to fair value of $54,986 and $132,257 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, using the Black Scholes model. The fair value of warrant liability changed mainly as a result of fluctuations in the Company’s share price. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the Company’s warrant liability are reflected as a gain or loss on fair value of warrants in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company recognized a gain on fair value of warrants of $58,158 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a loss of $110,518 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation were as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 6.11 $ 9.95 Warrant Exercise Price $ 3,000 $ 3,000 Warrant conversion ratio 1,000 1,000 Annual Volatility 65.5 % 71.3 % Annual Risk-Free Rate 0.6 % 0.2 % Expected Term 1.4 year 2.4 year F-51 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) Level 3 Purchase option derivative asset The following table summarizes the changes in the purchase option derivative asset for the year ended December 31, 2021: Balance at December 31, 2020 $ — Initial fair value measurement of purchase option derivative asset 1,122 Revaluation of purchase option derivative asset (254 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 868 The purchase option derivative asset has been measured at fair value at the transaction date using the Monte Carlo simulation model that relies on assumptions around the Company’s EBITDA volatility and risk adjusted discount, among others. The fair value of the derivative asset at the date of transaction was $1,122. The derivative asset was remeasured to fair value at $868 at December 31, 2021. The Company recognized a loss on fair value of purchase option derivative asset of $254. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model are summarized below: August 20, 2021 December 31, 2021 Term (in years) 1.7 1.3 Risk-free rate 0.3 % 0.4 % EBITDA discount rate 15.0 % 15.0 % EBITDA volatility 60.0 % 44.0 % Contingent Consideration Payable The fair value of contingent consideration was determined using a probability weighted model based on the likelihood of achieving certain revenue and EBITDA scenario outcomes. A discount rate of 12.2% (December 31, 2020 – 12.3% to 12.9%; December 31, 2019- 11.8%) was utilized to determine the present value of the liabilities, resulting in a loss on revaluation of contingent consideration of $3,584, $18,709, and $46,857 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. See Note 4 – Acquisitions for reconciliation of and discussion the changes in fair value. The illustrative variance of the total contingent consideration at December 31, 2021 based on reasonably possible changes to one of the significant unobservable inputs, holding other inputs constant, would have the following effects: Discount rate sensitivity KCR Increase 100 basis points $ 1,105 Increase 50 basis points $ 1,126 Decrease 50 basis points $ 1,170 Decrease 100 basis points $ 1,193 The contingent consideration for State Flower was calculated based on fiscal year 2021 revenue and the final earnout has been calculated as of December 31, 2021 (Note 4). The contingent consideration for Ilera was calculated based on fiscal year 2019 and 2020 performance and the final earn out has been calculated as of December 31, 2020 (Note 4). Risk Management The Company’s risk exposure and the impact on the Company’s financial instruments are summarized below: (a) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and notes receivable. The Company assesses the credit risk of trade receivables by evaluating the aging of trade receivables based on the invoice date. The carrying amounts of trade F-52 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) receivables are reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss . When a trade receivable balance is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for expected credit losses. The Company has reviewed the items comprising the accounts receivable balance and determined that the majority of accounts are collectible. Accordingly, an allowance for doubtful accounts has been recorded. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company regularly monitors credit risk exposure and takes steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in actual loss. The Company has no customers whose balance is greater than 10% of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2021. (b) Liquidity risk The Company is exposed to liquidity risk, or the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages liquidity risk through ongoing review of its capital requirements. The Company’s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations. (c) Market Risk The significant market risk exposures to which the Company is exposed are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. i) Foreign currency risk: Foreign currency risk is the risk that a variation in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and US dollar and other foreign currencies will affect the Company’s operations and financial results. The Company and its subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company does not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. Consequently, fluctuations in foreign currencies could have a negative impact on the profitability of the Company’s operations. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar resulted in $3,191 potential loss. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar resulted in a $3,900 potential gain. The estimated fair values of the Company’s foreign currency exchange rate. Other than the cash and cash equivalents noted previously, the Company does not hold significant monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than its functional currency. ii) Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. In respect of financial assets, the Company's policy is to invest excess cash at floating rates of interest in cash equivalents, in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the value of cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in guaranteed investment certificates bear a fixed rate and are cashable at any time prior to maturity date. The company does not have significant cash equivalents at year end. The Company’s loans payable have fixed interest rates from 6% to 12.875% per annum. The mortgage payable bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.5% per annum. All other financial liabilities are non-interest-bearing instruments. 2 2 . Commitments and contingencies On October 15, 2018, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary TerrAscend Canada entered into a multi-year cultivation agreement (the “PharmHouse Agreement”) with PharmHouse Inc. (“PharmHouse”), a joint venture between RIV Capital and 2615975 Ontario Inc., the operators of a leading North American greenhouse produce company (“261”). Under the terms of the PharmHouse Agreement, it was expected that PharmHouse would grow and supply cannabis to TerrAscend Canada from its existing 1.3 million square foot greenhouse located in Leamington, Ontario. Once fully licensed, the production of flower, trim and clones from up to 20% of the dedicated flowering space planted at the greenhouse was expected to be made available to TerrAscend Canada. To date, PharmHouse has not yet delivered product in accordance with the terms of the PharmHouse Agreement. F-53 TERRASCEND CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands, except per share/unit amounts) On September 11, 2020, the Company and TerrAscend Canada were informed that a statement of claim was issued on August 31, 2020 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice by 261 against RIV Capital, Canopy Growth, the Company and TerrAscend Canada (the “261 Claim”). In the 261 Claim, 261 alleged the Company worked with the other defendants to bankrupt PharmHouse in order to avoid having to purchase certain products to be provided by PharmHouse under the PharmHouse Agreement. 261 sought damages from the defendants in the amount of C$500,000 and alleged certain causes of action, including bad faith, fraud, civil conspiracy, breach of the duty of honesty and good faith in contractual relations and breach of fiduciary duty. On September 16, 2020, in connection with its bankruptcy proceedings, PharmHouse obtained an order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting PharmHouse creditor protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”). Pursuant to the CCAA order, the 261 Claim was stayed. During a CCAA hearing in November 2020, 261 objected to the stay of the 261 Claim. The judge presiding over the CCAA process agreed to allow 261 to discontinue the 261 Claim against the defendants “without prejudice” to its right to recommence the 261 Claim against all parties except PharmHouse Inc., provided that such recommenced claim can only be brought after January 1, 2021. This does not affect any of the defendants’ ability to move for a stay of the recommenced 261 Claim. On February 10, 2021, 261 served the Company and TerrAscend Canada with the recommenced 261 Claim. The recommenced 261 Claim contains the same factual allegations as the 261 Claim, the same legal claims and the same relief sought; however, it was not recommenced against PharmHouse Inc. The Company has not accrued any contingencies with respect to the recommenced 261 Claim. On March 11, 2021, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice approved a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) between the Company, TerrAscend Canada and PharmHouse. 261 is not a party to the Settlement Agreement. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice held in its March 11, 2021 endorsement that nothing in the Settlement Agreement releases or compromises any of the claims or causes of action asserted against the Company or TerrAscend Canada in the recommenced 261 Claim. The Settlement Agreement provides that the Company make a one-time purchase of a specific quantity of cannabis that was grown under the PharmHouse Agreement for a set price per gram, totaling C$1,166,669.93, and for a one-time cash payment of C$725,000 to PharmHouse for full and final satisfaction of any claims or obligations between the Company, TerrAscend Canada and PharmHouse. The Company paid all amounts due under the Settlement Agreement and has commercialized the purchased cannabis. The Settlement Agreement does not affect the recommenced 261 Claim issued on February 10, 2021, as the plaintiff in the recommenced 261 Claim is not a party to the Settlement Agreement and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that nothing in the Settlement Agreement releases or compromises any of the claims or causes of action asserted against the Company or TerrAscend Canada in the recommenced 261 Claim. On October 20, 2018, Investments International Inc. (“Investments”) signed a lease agreement with the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 2627685 Ontario Inc. and 2151924 Alberta Inc. On February 8, 2019, Investments filed a statement of claim under the Court of Alberta against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, for breach of the lease agreement. The amount claimed is $2,764 plus interest from and after the termination date of an unexecuted lease. The Company has paid initial lease deposits in addition to submitting a statement of defence. The Company does not expect the claim to have a material adverse impact on the Company and no amount has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements. From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2021, there were no pending lawsuits other than those disclosed that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 23.
