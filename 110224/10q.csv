NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 1. Nature of Operations and Financial Statement Presentation Nature of Operations Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise solutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums, and healthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys also is known for its world-class customer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2024 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 19, 2023. Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to uncertainties. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”) to update income tax disclosure requirements 8 primarily by requiring specific categories and greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation and disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments in the ASU also remove disclosures related to certain unrecognized tax benefits and deferred taxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, or our fiscal 2026. The amendments may be applied prospectively or retrospectively with early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the requirements on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”) to expand reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in the ASU require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to an entity's chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. ASU 2023-07 applies to entities with a single reportable segment. Annual disclosures are required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 or our fiscal 2025. Interim disclosures are required for periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, or our fiscal 2026. Retrospective application is required for all prior periods presented with early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the requirements on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. We recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of sale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. We derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for our proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes the same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the contract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of payment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software. 9 Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, implementation, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. Products revenue recognized at a point in time totaled $ 12.7 million and $ 10.7 million , and $ 38.1 million and $ 32.3 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Subscription and maintenance, and professional services revenue recognized substantially over time totaled $ 47.9 million and $ 39.2 million , and $ 137.1 million and $ 112.9 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to products and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 12.0 million and $ 9.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 48.9 million and $ 44.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 0.2 million and $ 0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 2.1 million and $ 1.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2023 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 4.3 million and $ 3.7 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023, we expensed $ 1.0 million and $ 2.9 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.4 million and $ 1.2 million , respectively. During the comparable periods ending December 31, 2022, we expensed $ 1.1 million and $ 2.6 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.9 million , respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and 10 marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 4. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 12,705 $ 11,170 Other taxes payable 1,867 2,127 Professional fees 269 95 Other 469 316 Total $ 15,310 $ 13,708 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ — $ 1,178 Employee benefit obligations 3,840 2,742 Other 103 98 Total $ 3,943 $ 4,018 5. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Cash receipts for interest, net $ 3,191 $ 1,046 Cash payments for income tax, net 1,246 912 Cash payments for operating leases 3,684 4,207 Cash payments for finance leases 4 4 Accrued capital expenditures 114 332 During October 2023, we terminated certain agreements of leased office space before the expiration of their lease terms resulting in the removal of $ 3.8 million in lease liabilities and $ 3.2 million in associated right-of-use assets with a gain of $ 0.6 million. We also sold certain related property and equipment for a gain of $ 0.5 million resulting in a total gain on asset disposals of $ 1.1 million reported as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2023. During November 2023, in a noncash financing transaction, we converted $ 35 million of Series A convertible preferred stock, no par value, to common stock as further described in Note 10, Preferred Stock . 6. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax provision and effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Income tax (benefit) provision $ ( 68,043 ) $ 678 $ ( 67,396 ) $ 920 Effective tax rate nm 14.8 % nm 8.1 % nm - not meaningful 11 Since the end of fiscal 2009, we have recorded valuation allowances offsetting substantially all the Company’s deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we determined that it was more likely than not that the Company would be able to realize the benefit of substantially all of its deferred tax assets in the United States. In reaching this determination, we considered our growing trend of profitability over recent years, our expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income as well as the overall improvement in the Company’s business. As a result, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit related to the release of approximately $ 65.1 million in valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the United States and Canada that are expected to be realized in future years, which caused our effective tax rate to differ from the statutory rate. At December 31, 2023, the Company continued to provide a valuation allowance of $ 2.8 million primarily against certain state and foreign net operating losses (“NOLs”). For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 68.0 million and $ 67.4 million , respectively. Excluding the release of $ 65.1 million in valuation allowance and the release of $ 1.0 million in uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest due to expiration of various US state statutes of limitations, the Company recorded income tax benefit of $ 5.6 million for tax windfalls from stock compensation, income tax benefit of $ 2.4 million for R&D credits and, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023, deferred income tax expense of $ 6.1 million and $ 6.7 million , respectively. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax provision of $ 0.7 million and $ 0.9 million , respectively, primarily related to income tax in states where NOL usage is statutorily limited. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in several foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first five years of operations, which included fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during its second five years of operations, which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. For federal income tax purposes, as of March 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 132 million , which will expire from fiscal 2032 through fiscal 2038 , and net operating loss carryforwards of $ 43.8 million that are not subject to expiration. For state purposes, at the end of fiscal 2023, the Company had $ 10.1 million of net operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income, the majority of which will expire from fiscal 2032 through fiscal 2043 . 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. Although Agilysys has not yet been dismissed from the case, all of the patents asserted against us by Ameranth were determined by the Court to be invalid, and all of Ameranth’s appeals have been exhausted. 12 8. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 77,141 $ 3,892 $ 83,234 $ 10,507 Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 286 ) ( 459 ) ( 1,204 ) ( 1,377 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 76,855 $ 3,433 $ 82,030 $ 9,130 Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 25,808 24,703 25,256 24,651 Dilutive SSARs 920 1,149 951 996 Dilutive unvested restricted shares 223 218 239 133 Dilutive unvested restricted stock units 28 — 17 — Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 26,979 26,070 26,463 25,780 Income per share - basic: $ 2.98 $ 0.14 $ 3.25 $ 0.37 Income per share - diluted: $ 2.85 $ 0.13 $ 3.10 $ 0.35 Anti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 89 1,736 30 1,751 Basic income per share is computed as net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 454,336 and 459,306 of restricted shares at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income per share includes the impact of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs), restricted shares, restricted stock units, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted stock units that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or grants of restricted shares, restricted stock units or performance shares. For SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition. Restricted shares and restricted stock units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted shares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying grants. 13 We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock unit and restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term. For restricted stock unit, restricted share, and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold, performance period term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted stock units, restricted shares, and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. The fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Product development 1,878 2,108 4,743 5,770 Sales and marketing 228 257 487 822 General and administrative 1,532 1,101 4,259 2,818 Total share-based compensation expense 3,638 3,466 9,489 9,410 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2023 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 Granted — — Exercised ( 238,098 ) 18.27 Forfeited — — Expired — — Outstanding at December 31, 2023 1,334,362 $ 27.42 2.3 $ 76,591 Exercisable at December 31, 2023 1,334,362 $ 27.42 2.3 $ 76,591 Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 1,334,362 $ 27.42 2.3 $ 76,591 As of December 31, 2023, there was no unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to SSARs. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted shares are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2023 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: 14 Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 407,324 $ 47.53 Granted 198,969 88.36 Vested ( 129,937 ) 48.51 Forfeited ( 22,020 ) 46.76 Outstanding at December 31, 2023 454,336 $ 65.19 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares includes grants subject only to a service condition and certain grants subject to both a service condition and a market condition. As of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted shares was $ 20.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.5 years. Restricted Stock Units We granted restricted stock units to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted stock units are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during nine months ended December 31, 2023 for restricted stock units awarded under the 2020 Plan: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 67,856 $ 71.62 Granted — — Vested — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at December 31, 2023 67,856 $ 71.62 As of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units was $ 2.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 2.3 years. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted 5,168 common shares to our Chief Executive Officer in May 2023 that vested immediately for a total value of $ 0.4 million. 10. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Conversion On November 24, 2023, at our option, we required conversion of all the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock. On November 27, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Elimination with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to which the Convertible Preferred Stock was eliminated and returned to the status of 15 authorized and unissued preferred shares of the Company. Following the mandatory conversion of the outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock on November 24, 2023, there were no outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock. Accordingly, we removed the Series A convertible preferred stock, no par value from temporary equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet and recorded the associated increase of common shares at $ 0.30 stated value and capital in excess of stated value further reflected in our condensed consolidated statement of shareholders' equity. Dividends Prior to the conversion on November 24, 2023, the Holders were entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We paid dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. 16 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 26 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments Macroeconomic Conditions During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023, global macroeconomic conditions were, and continue to be, impacted by a number of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars, labor shortages, supply chain inconsistencies, inflation, and the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We believe such conditions continue to influence customer spending and provider pricing decisions resulting in decreased demand, increased costs, and reduced margins particularly in areas outside of the United States. Our Business Agilysys exclusively delivers state-of-the-art software solutions and services that help organizations achieve High Return Hospitality by maximizing Return on Experience (ROE) through interactions that make ‘personal’ profitable. Customers around the world use Agilysys Property Management Systems (PMS), Point-of-Sale (POS) and F&B Inventory and Procurement (I&P) solutions to consistently delight guests, retain staff and grow margins. Agilysys’ 100% hospitality customer base includes branded and independent hotels; multi-amenity resorts; casinos; property, hotel and resort management companies; cruise lines; corporate dining providers; higher education campus dining providers; food service management companies; hospitals; lifestyle communities; senior living facilities; stadiums; and theme parks. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia. Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we will continue enhancing existing software products while developing and marketing new software products and expanding our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. 17 Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, increasing profitability and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, subscription and maintenance revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: 18 Results of Operations Third Fiscal Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Fiscal Quarter 2023 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Three months ended December 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 12,678 $ 10,697 $ 1,981 18.5 % Subscription and maintenance 35,107 30,154 4,953 16.4 % Professional services 12,781 9,069 3,712 40.9 % Total net revenue 60,566 49,920 10,646 21.3 % Cost of goods sold: Products 6,707 5,368 1,339 24.9 % Subscription and maintenance 7,371 6,767 604 8.9 % Professional services 8,664 7,009 1,655 23.6 % Total cost of goods sold 22,742 19,144 3,598 18.8 % Gross profit $ 37,824 $ 30,776 $ 7,048 22.9 % Gross profit margin 62.5 % 61.7 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 14,551 $ 12,416 $ 2,135 17.2 % Sales and marketing 6,137 5,886 251 4.3 % General and administrative 9,057 7,928 1,129 14.2 % Depreciation of fixed assets 909 437 472 nm Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 343 430 (87 ) (20.2 )% Other (gains) and charges, net (924 ) 93 (1,017 ) nm Legal settlements — 104 (104 ) nm Operating income $ 7,751 $ 3,482 $ 4,269 122.6 % Operating income percentage 12.8 % 7.0 % nm - not meaningful 19 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net revenue: Products 20.9 % 21.4 % Subscription and maintenance 58.0 60.4 Professional services 21.1 18.2 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.0 % 10.7 % Subscription and maintenance 12.2 13.6 Professional services 14.3 14.0 Total net cost of goods sold 37.5 % 38.3 % Gross profit 62.5 % 61.7 % Operating expenses: Product development 24.0 % 24.8 % Sales and marketing 10.1 11.8 General and administrative 15.0 15.9 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.5 0.9 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.6 0.9 Other (gains) and charges, net (1.5 ) 0.2 Legal settlements — 0.2 Operating income 12.8 % 7.0 % Net revenue.

Income Taxes Three months ended December 31, Favorable (unfavorable) (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Income tax (benefit) provision $ (68,043 ) $ 678 $ 68,721 nm Effective tax rate nm 14.8 % nm - not meaningful Since the end of fiscal 2009, we have recorded valuation allowances offsetting substantially all the Company’s deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we determined that it was more likely than not that the Company would be able to realize the benefit of substantially all of its deferred tax assets in the United States. In reaching this determination, we considered our growing trend of profitability over recent years, our expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income as well as the overall improvement in the Company’s business and its current market position. As a result, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit related to the release of approximately $65.1 million in valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the United States and Canada that are expected to be realized in future years, which caused our effective tax rate to differ from the statutory rate. At December 31, 2023, the Company continued to provide a valuation allowance of $2.8 million primarily against certain state and foreign net operating losses (“NOLs”). For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $68.0 million. Excluding the release of $65.1 million in valuation allowance and the release of $1.0 million in uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest due to expiration of various US state statutes of limitations, the Company recorded excess tax benefits of $5.6 million related to share-based compensation, income tax benefit of $2.4 million for R&D credits and deferred income tax expense of $6.1 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded income tax provision of $0.7 million, primarily related to income tax in states where NOL usage is statutorily limited. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in several foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first five years of operations, which included fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is subject to 50% of regular India income taxes during its second five years of operations, which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. 21 Results of Operations First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 Compared to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Nine months ended December 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 38,100 $ 32,291 $ 5,809 18.0 % Subscription and maintenance 101,481 86,917 14,564 16.8 % Professional services 35,662 25,960 9,702 37.4 % Total net revenue 175,243 145,168 30,075 20.7 % Cost of goods sold: Products 20,023 16,682 3,341 20.0 % Subscription and maintenance 22,812 19,223 3,589 18.7 % Professional services 26,428 20,627 5,801 28.1 % Total cost of goods sold 69,263 56,532 12,731 22.5 % Gross profit $ 105,980 $ 88,636 $ 17,344 19.6 % Gross profit margin 60.5 % 61.1 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 42,455 $ 36,550 $ 5,905 16.2 % Sales and marketing 19,838 16,619 3,219 19.4 % General and administrative 27,207 22,850 4,357 19.1 % Depreciation of fixed assets 3,042 1,371 1,671 121.9 % Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,120 1,326 (206 ) (15.5 )% Other (gains) and charges, net 45 374 (329 ) (88.0 )% Legal settlements — 104 (104 ) (100.0 )% Operating income $ 12,273 $ 9,442 $ 2,831 30.0 % Operating income percentage 7.0 % 6.5 % nm - not meaningful 22 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Nine months ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net revenue: Products 21.7 % 22.2 % Subscription and maintenance 57.9 59.9 Professional services 20.4 17.9 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.4 % 11.5 % Subscription and maintenance 13.0 13.2 Professional services 15.1 14.2 Total net cost of goods sold 39.5 % 38.9 % Gross profit 60.5 % 61.1 % Operating expenses: Product development 24.4 % 25.2 % Sales and marketing 11.3 11.5 General and administrative 15.5 15.7 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.7 0.9 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.6 0.9 Other (gains) and charges, net — 0.3 Legal settlements — 0.1 Operating income 7.0 % 6.5 % Net revenue.

Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space. At December 31, 2023, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 94% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $116.2 million as of December 31, 2023, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 18,379 $ 17,680 Investing activities (7,660 ) (3,643 ) Financing activities (7,399 ) (4,763 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 38 (427 ) Increase in cash $ 3,358 $ 8,847 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $18.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $29.2 million and a decrease of $10.8 million due to changes in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash-based earnings is net income of $83.2 million less $54 million of non-cash adjustments. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases, which increased during the nine months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022 due to leasehold improvements and equipment purchases for our new office lease at our development center in Chennai, India. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the $7.4 million used in financing activities consisted of $5.7 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.7 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2023, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2023. 25 Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, as Principal Accounting Officer (“PAO”), management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and PAO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO, CFO and PAO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 26 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 1. Nature of Operations and Financial Statement Presentation Nature of Operations Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise solutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums, and healthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys also is known for its world-class customer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2024 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 19, 2023. Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to uncertainties. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any 8 individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. We recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of sale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. We derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for our proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes the same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the contract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of payment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, implementation, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. 9 Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. Products revenue recognized at a point in time totaled $ 12.6 million and $ 10.5 million , and $ 25.4 million and $ 21.6 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Subscription and maintenance, and professional services revenue recognized substantially over time totaled $ 46.0 million and $ 37.2 million , and $ 89.3 million and $ 73.7 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to products and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 14.8 million and $ 13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 36.9 million and $ 34.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 0.3 million and $ 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 1.9 million and $ 1.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2023 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 4.1 million and $ 3.4 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, we expensed $ 0.9 million and $ 1.9 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively. During the comparable periods ending September 30, 2022, we expensed $ 0.8 million and $ 1.5 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.6 million , respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 10 4. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) September 30, 2023 March 31, 2023 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 11,264 $ 11,170 Other taxes payable 1,918 2,127 Professional fees 212 95 Other 370 316 Total $ 13,764 $ 13,708 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,190 $ 1,178 Employee benefit obligations 3,566 2,742 Other 102 98 Total $ 4,858 $ 4,018 During October 2023, we signed an agreement with the landlord of certain leased office space to terminate the existing lease agreements before the expiration of their lease terms. The agreement will result in the removal of approximately $ 3.9 million in lease liabilities and approximately $ 3.3 million in associated right-of-use assets with a resulting gain of approximately $ 0.6 million . 5. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Cash receipts for interest, net $ 1,948 $ 407 Cash payments for income tax, net 900 624 Cash payments for operating leases 2,376 2,619 Cash payments for finance leases 3 3 Accrued capital expenditures 227 270 6. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax provision and effective tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Income tax provision (benefit) $ 295 $ ( 158 ) $ 647 $ 240 Effective tax rate 6.1 % ( 4.6 )% 9.6 % 3.5 % For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first five years of operations, which included fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during its second five years of operations, which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. We have recorded valuation allowances offsetting substantially all the Company’s deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during the future periods in which the underlying temporary differences are 11 deductible. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe it is reasonably possible that during the year ending March 31, 2024, we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant portion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance releases will depend on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded effective tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation allowance release. Any valuation allowance release will not impact the amount of cash paid for income taxes. 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims under the patent except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. In March 2022, the District Court declared the remaining two claims to be patent ineligible, and this judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in September 2023. Ameranth may still appeal this ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, and at this time we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. 8. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 4,545 $ 3,576 $ 6,093 $ 6,615 Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) ( 459 ) ( 918 ) ( 918 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 4,086 $ 3,117 $ 5,175 $ 5,697 Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 25,022 24,652 24,979 24,625 Dilutive SSARs 919 992 964 881 Dilutive unvested restricted shares 171 139 201 85 Dilutive unvested restricted stock units 5 — 4 — Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 26,117 25,783 26,148 25,591 Income per share - basic: $ 0.16 $ 0.13 $ 0.21 $ 0.23 Income per share - diluted: $ 0.16 $ 0.12 $ 0.20 $ 0.22 Anti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 1,735 1,735 1,735 1,736 Basic income per share is computed as net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 326,290 and 377,491 of restricted 12 shares at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income per share includes the impact of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs), restricted shares, restricted stock units, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted stock units that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or grants of restricted shares, restricted stock units or performance shares. For SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition. Restricted shares and restricted stock units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted shares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying grants. We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock unit and restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term. For restricted stock unit, restricted share, and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold, performance period term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted stock units, restricted shares, and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. The fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Product development 1,239 2,141 2,865 3,662 Sales and marketing 94 290 259 565 General and administrative 1,351 1,025 2,727 1,717 Total share-based compensation expense 2,684 3,456 5,851 5,944 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. 13 The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2023 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 Granted — — Exercised ( 118,985 ) 17.91 Forfeited — — Expired — — Outstanding at September 30, 2023 1,453,475 $ 26.70 2.7 $ 57,354 Exercisable at September 30, 2023 1,453,475 $ 26.70 2.7 $ 57,354 Vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2023 1,453,475 $ 26.70 2.7 $ 57,354 As of September 30, 2023, there was no unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to SSARs. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted shares are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2023 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 407,324 $ 47.53 Granted 23,574 70.08 Vested ( 85,056 ) 45.51 Forfeited ( 19,552 ) 46.24 Outstanding at September 30, 2023 326,290 $ 49.77 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares includes grants subject only to a service condition and certain grants subject to both a service condition and a market condition. As of September 30, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted shares was $ 7.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.8 years. Restricted Stock Units We granted restricted stock units to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted stock units are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during six months ended September 30, 2023 for restricted stock units awarded under the 2020 Plan: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 67,856 $ 71.62 Granted — — Vested — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at September 30, 2023 67,856 $ 71.62 As of September 30, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units was $ 3.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 2.5 years. 14 Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted 5,168 common shares to our Chief Executive Officer in May 2023 that vested immediately for a total value of $ 0.4 million. 10. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Conversion Each Holder has the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as described in the Certificate of Designation). Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023 , the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is at least 150 % of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert. Dividends The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We pay dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. 15 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 24 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments Macroeconomic Conditions During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, global macroeconomic conditions were, and continue to be, impacted by a number of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars, labor shortages, supply chain inconsistencies, inflation, and the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We believe such conditions continue to influence customer spending and provider pricing decisions resulting in decreased demand, increased costs, and reduced margins particularly in areas outside of the United States. Our Business Agilysys exclusively delivers state-of-the-art software solutions and services that help organizations achieve High Return Hospitality by maximizing Return on Experience (ROE) through interactions that make ‘personal’ profitable. Customers around the world use Agilysys Property Management Systems (PMS), Point-of-Sale (POS) solutions and Inventory and Procurement (I&P) systems to consistently delight guests, retain staff and grow margins. Agilysys’ 100 percent hospitality customer base includes branded and independent hotels; multi-amenity resorts; casinos; property, hotel and resort management companies; cruise lines; corporate dining providers; higher education campus dining providers; food service management companies; hospitals; lifestyle communities; senior living facilities; stadiums; and theme parks. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia. Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we will continue enhancing existing software products while developing and marketing new software products and expanding our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. 16 Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, increasing profitability and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, subscription and maintenance revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: 17 Results of Operations Second Fiscal Quarter 2024 Compared to Second Fiscal Quarter 2023 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 12,640 $ 10,548 $ 2,092 19.8 % Subscription and maintenance 34,248 29,036 5,212 18.0 % Professional services 11,728 8,158 3,570 43.8 % Total net revenue 58,616 47,742 10,874 22.8 % Cost of goods sold: Products 6,751 5,434 1,317 24.2 % Subscription and maintenance 7,804 6,170 1,634 26.5 % Professional services 8,965 6,773 2,192 32.4 % Total cost of goods sold 23,520 18,377 5,143 28.0 % Gross profit $ 35,096 $ 29,365 $ 5,731 19.5 % Gross profit margin 59.9 % 61.5 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 14,583 $ 12,577 $ 2,006 15.9 % Sales and marketing 6,400 5,320 1,080 20.3 % General and administrative 8,785 7,570 1,215 16.1 % Depreciation of fixed assets 1,209 461 748 162.3 % Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 347 443 (96 ) (21.7 )% Other charges 210 67 143 nm Operating income $ 3,562 $ 2,927 $ 635 21.7 % Operating income percentage 6.1 % 6.1 % nm - not meaningful 18 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Net revenue: Products 21.6 % 22.1 % Subscription and maintenance 58.4 60.8 Professional services 20.0 17.1 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.5 % 11.4 % Subscription and maintenance 13.3 12.9 Professional services 15.3 14.2 Total net cost of goods sold 40.1 % 38.5 % Gross profit 59.9 % 61.5 % Operating expenses: Product development 24.9 % 26.3 % Sales and marketing 10.9 11.2 General and administrative 15.0 15.9 Depreciation of fixed assets 2.1 1.0 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.6 0.9 Other charges 0.3 0.1 Operating income 6.1 % 6.1 % Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $10.9 million, or 22.8%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Products revenue increased $2.1 million, or 19.8%, due to higher sales and deliveries to new customers and expansion with existing customers. Subscription and maintenance revenue increased $5.2 million, or 18.0%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 29.1% during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Professional services revenue increased $3.6 million, or 43.8%, due to higher sales and service activity as our new and existing customers continue implementing technology to improve their operations.

Our total gross profit increased $5.7 million, or 19.5%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and total gross profit margin decreased from 61.5% to 59.9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $0.8 million, or 15.2%, and products gross profit margin decreased from 48.5% to 46.6% due to the composition of hardware products delivered. Subscription and maintenance gross profit increased $3.6 million, or 15.6%, and gross profit margin decreased from 78.8% to 77.2% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit increased $1.4 million, or 99.5%, and gross profit margin increased from 17.0% to 23.6% reflecting improved utilization rates from efficiency gains on multi-solution implementations. Operating Expenses Operating expenses, excluding other charges, increased $5.0 million, or 18.8%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Product development. Product development increased $2.0 million, or 15.9%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to hiring and increased salary, incentive and employee benefits rates across our development teams, and higher rent. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $1.1 million, or 20.3%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to hiring and increased salary, incentive and employee benefits rates across our sales and marketing teams, higher levels of marketing event and trade show activity and increased commission expense on higher sales activity. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $1.2 million, or 16.1%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to hiring and increased salary, incentive and employee benefits rates across our administrative teams. 19 Other charges.

Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net mainly consists of movement of foreign currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three Months Ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Income tax provision (benefit) $ 295 $ (158 ) $ (453 ) nm Effective tax rate 6.1 % (4.6 )% nm - not meaningful For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements remain uncertain, we expect that, as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations, a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits including related penalties and interest is more likely than not to occur during the year ending March 31, 2024. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of the Company’s deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe it is reasonably possible that during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant portion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits. 20 Results of Operations First Half Fiscal 2024 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2023 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: Six Months Ended September 30, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 25,422 $ 21,594 $ 3,828 17.7 % Subscription and maintenance 66,373 56,763 9,610 16.9 % Professional services 22,881 16,891 5,990 35.5 % Total net revenue 114,676 95,248 19,428 20.4 % Cost of goods sold: Products 13,317 11,314 2,003 17.7 % Subscription and maintenance 15,441 12,456 2,985 24.0 % Professional services 17,764 13,618 4,146 30.4 % Total cost of goods sold 46,522 37,388 9,134 24.4 % Gross profit $ 68,154 $ 57,860 $ 10,294 17.8 % Gross profit margin 59.4 % 60.7 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 27,904 $ 24,134 $ 3,770 15.6 % Sales and marketing 13,701 10,733 2,968 27.7 % General and administrative 18,150 14,922 3,228 21.6 % Depreciation of fixed assets 2,133 934 1,199 128.4 % Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 776 896 (120 ) (13.4 )% Other charges 969 281 688 244.8 % Operating income $ 4,521 $ 5,960 $ (1,439 ) (24.1 )% Operating income percentage 3.9 % 6.3 % nm - not meaningful 21 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Net revenue: Products 22.1 % 22.7 % Subscription and maintenance 57.9 59.6 Professional services 20.0 17.7 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.6 % 11.9 % Subscription and maintenance 13.5 13.1 Professional services 15.5 14.3 Total net cost of goods sold 40.6 % 39.3 % Gross profit 59.4 % 60.7 % Operating expenses: Product development 24.3 % 25.3 % Sales and marketing 11.9 11.2 General and administrative 15.8 15.7 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.9 1.0 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.7 0.9 Other charges 0.9 0.3 Operating income 3.9 % 6.3 % Net revenue.

Income Taxes Six Months Ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Income tax provision $ 647 $ 240 $ (407 ) nm Effective tax rate 9.6 % 3.5 % nm - not meaningful For the six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements remain uncertain, we expect that, as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations, a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits including related penalties and interest is more likely than not to occur during the year ending March 31, 2024. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of the Company’s deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe it is reasonably possible that during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant portion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, and payments of contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. At September 30, 2023, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 93% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other 23 observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $107.4 million as of September 30, 2023, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 5,470 $ 3,117 Investing activities (6,004 ) (799 ) Financing activities (4,788 ) (2,375 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (107 ) (718 ) (Decrease) increase in cash $ (5,429 ) $ (775 ) Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $5.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2024. The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $14.5 million and a decrease of $9.0 million due to changes in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash-based earnings is net income of $6.1 million plus $8.4 million of non-cash expenses including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases, which increased significantly during the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2022 due to leasehold improvements and equipment purchases for our new office lease at our development center in Chennai, India. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first six months of fiscal 2024, the $4.8 million used in financing activities consisted of $3.9 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $0.9 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2023, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2023. Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly 24 announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, as Principal Accounting Officer (“PAO”), management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and PAO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the six months ended September 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO, CFO and PAO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 25 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2024 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2023, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 19, 2023. Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to uncertainties. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master service agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any 8 individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. We recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer’s final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we ship or are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. Our subscription service revenue is primarily based on rates per location, including rates per points of sale and per room. We recognize certain subscription service revenue on a per-transaction basis. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, any hosting services, and any transaction-based services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. We derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for our proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes the same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the contract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of payment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, implementation, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer’s ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to derive standalone selling price (“SSP”) by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. 9 Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (proprietary software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), subscription and maintenance, and professional services. Products revenue recognized at a point in time totaled $ 12.8 million and $ 11.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Subscription and maintenance, and professional services revenue recognized substantially over time totaled $ 43.3 million and $ 36.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to products and professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 22.1 million and $ 20.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 1.6 million and $ 1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of June 30, 2023 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 4.0 million and $ 3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we expensed $ 0.9 million and $ 0.7 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.3 million , respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 4. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) June 30, 2023 March 31, 2023 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 7,946 $ 11,170 Other taxes payable 2,602 2,127 Professional fees 105 95 Other 604 316 Total $ 11,257 $ 13,708 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,184 $ 1,178 Employee benefit obligations 3,041 2,742 Other 101 98 Total $ 4,326 $ 4,018 10 During the three months ended June 30, 2023 , two operating leases commenced for a total obligation of $ 12.4 million with a weighted average lease term of approximately 5.4 years. Accordingly, we reported the lease obligations in operating lease liabilities, current and non-current, and the associated operating lease right-of-use assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023 . 5. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Cash receipts for interest, net $ 893 $ 100 Cash payments for income tax, net 376 332 Cash payments for operating leases 1,425 1,468 Cash payments for finance leases 2 2 Accrued capital expenditures 320 158 6. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2023: Three Months Ended June 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Income tax expense $ 352 $ 398 Effective tax rate 18.5 % 11.6 % For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first five years of operations, which included fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during its second five years of operations, which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. We have recorded valuation allowances offsetting substantially all the Company’s deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of taxable income during the future periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe it is reasonably possible that during the year ending March 31, 2024, we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant portion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance releases will depend on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded effective tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not impact the amount of cash paid for income taxes. 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was 11 consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In December 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth appealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 11, 2022, in accordance with its prior rulings, the District Court entered judgment in favor of us and against Ameranth on all claims asserted against us, however, Ameranth's appeal remains pending. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 8. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 1,548 $ 3,039 Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) ( 459 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,089 $ 2,580 Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,936 24,598 Dilutive SSARs 1,008 728 Dilutive unvested restricted shares 231 44 Dilutive unvested restricted stock units 2 — Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 26,177 25,370 Income per share - basic: $ 0.04 $ 0.10 Income per share - diluted: $ 0.04 $ 0.10 Anti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and preferred shares 1,735 1,797 Basic income per share is computed as net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 339,956 and 390,361 of restricted shares at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income per share includes the impact of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs), restricted shares, restricted stock units, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan) as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted stock units that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or grants of restricted shares, restricted stock units or performance shares. 12 For SSARs, the exercise price must be set at least equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant. The maximum term of SSARs is seven years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the period over which SSARs subject to a service condition vest and the vesting criteria for SSARs subject to a market condition. Restricted shares and restricted stock units, whether time-vested or performance-based, may be issued at no cost or at a purchase price that may be below their fair market value, but are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on their sale or other transfer. Performance-based grants may be conditioned upon the attainment of specified performance objectives and other conditions, restrictions, and contingencies. Restricted shares have the right to receive dividends, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying grants. We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock unit and restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term. For restricted stock unit, restricted share, and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold, performance period term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted stock units, restricted shares, and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. The fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Product development 1,625 1,521 Sales and marketing 166 275 General and administrative 1,376 692 Total share-based compensation expense 3,167 2,488 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2023 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 1,572,460 $ 26.04 Granted — — Exercised ( 63,153 ) 16.10 Forfeited — — Expired — — Outstanding at June 30, 2023 1,509,307 $ 26.45 3.0 $ 63,676 Exercisable at June 30, 2023 1,509,307 $ 26.45 3.0 $ 63,676 Vested and expected to vest at June 30, 2023 1,509,307 $ 26.45 3.0 $ 63,676 13 As of June 30, 2023, there was no unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to SSARs. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted shares are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2023 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 407,324 $ 47.53 Granted 23,574 70.08 Vested ( 79,087 ) 44.79 Forfeited ( 11,855 ) 44.75 Outstanding at June 30, 2023 339,956 $ 49.84 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares includes grants subject only to a service condition and certain grants subject to both a service condition and a market condition. As of June 30, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted shares was $ 9.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.0 years. Restricted Stock Units We granted restricted stock units to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted stock units are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during three months ended June 30, 2023 for restricted stock units awarded under the 2020 Plan: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 67,856 $ 71.62 Granted — — Vested — — Forfeited — — Outstanding at June 30, 2023 67,856 $ 71.62 As of June 30, 2023 , total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units was $ 4.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average vesting period of 2.8 years. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted 5,168 common shares to our Chief Executive Officer in May 2023 that vested immediately for a total value of $ 0.4 million. 10. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 14 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Conversion Each Holder has the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as described in the Certificate of Designation). Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023 , the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is at least 150 % of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert. Dividends The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We pay dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. 15 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 21 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments Macroeconomic Conditions During the three months ended June 30, 2023, global macroeconomic conditions were, and continue to be, influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the Russia-Ukraine war, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We believe such conditions are impacting customer spending and provider pricing decisions resulting in decreased demand, increased costs, and reduced margins particularly in areas outside of the United States. Our Business Agilysys is well known for its long heritage of hospitality-focused technology innovation. The Company delivers modular and integrated software solutions and expertise to businesses seeking to maximize Return on Experience (ROE) through hospitality encounters that are both personal and profitable.

The Agilysys Hospitality Cloud combines core operational systems for property management (PMS), point-of-sale (POS) and Inventory and Procurement (I&P) with Experience Enhancers that meaningfully improve interactions for guests and for employees across dimensions such as digital access, mobile convenience, self-service control, personal choice, payment options, service coverage and real-time insights to improve decisions. Core solutions and Experience Enhancers are selectively combined in Hospitality Solution Studios tailored to specific hospitality settings and business needs. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry.

Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, subscription and maintenance revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: 17 Results of Operations First Fiscal Quarter 2024 Compared to First Fiscal Quarter 2023 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended June 30, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 12,781 $ 11,046 $ 1,735 15.7 % Subscription and maintenance 32,125 27,727 4,398 15.9 % Professional services 11,153 8,733 2,420 27.7 % Total net revenue 56,059 47,506 8,553 18.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 6,565 5,879 686 11.7 % Subscription and maintenance 7,637 6,286 1,351 21.5 % Professional services 8,800 6,846 1,954 28.5 % Total cost of goods sold 23,002 19,011 3,991 21.0 % Gross profit $ 33,057 $ 28,495 $ 4,562 16.0 % Gross profit margin 59.0 % 60.0 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 13,321 $ 11,556 $ 1,765 15.3 % Sales and marketing 7,301 5,413 1,888 34.9 % General and administrative 9,365 7,353 2,012 27.4 % Depreciation of fixed assets 923 473 450 95.1 % Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 430 453 (23 ) (5.1 )% Other charges 759 214 545 nm Operating income $ 958 $ 3,033 $ (2,075 ) (68.4 )% Operating income percentage 1.7 % 6.4 % nm - not meaningful The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Net revenue: Products 22.8 % 23.2 % Subscription and maintenance 57.3 58.4 Professional services 19.9 18.4 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.7 % 12.4 % Subscription and maintenance 13.6 13.2 Professional services 15.7 14.4 Total net cost of goods sold 41.0 % 40.0 % Gross profit 59.0 % 60.0 % Operating expenses: Product development 23.8 % 24.3 % Sales and marketing 13.0 11.4 General and administrative 16.7 15.5 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.6 1.0 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.8 0.9 Other charges 1.4 0.5 Operating income 1.7 % 6.4 % 18 Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $8.6 million, or 18.0%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Products revenue increased $1.7 million, or 15.7%, due to higher sales and deliveries to new customers and expansion with existing customers. Subscription and maintenance revenue increased $4.4 million, or 15.9%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 27.4% during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Professional services revenue increased $2.4 million, or 27.7%, due to higher sales and service activity as our new and existing customers continue implementing technology to improve their operations. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $4.6 million, or 16.0%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and total gross profit margin decreased from 60.0% to 59.0% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023 driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $1.0 million, or 20.3%, and products gross profit margin increased from 46.8% to 48.6% due to a higher proportion of proprietary software deliveries. Subscription and maintenance gross profit increased $3.0 million, or 14.2%, and gross profit margin decreased from 77.3% to 76.2% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit margin decreased from 21.6% to 21.1% as we continue to invest in and train new service team members to meet the growing installation and implementation activity. Operating Expenses Operating expenses, excluding other charges and legal settlements, increased $6.1 million, or 24.1%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

Product development increased $1.8 million, or 15.3%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due to hiring and increased salary, incentive and employee benefits rates across our development teams, higher rent and increased travel. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $1.9 million, or 34.9%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due to hiring and increased salary, incentive and employee benefits rates across our sales and marketing teams, higher levels of marketing event and trade show activity and increased commission expense on higher sales activity. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $2.0 million, or 27.4%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due to hiring and increased salary, incentive and employee benefits rates across our administrative teams, and higher subscription charges for cloud computing arrangements. Other charges. Other charges consist of severance costs, infrequent settlements of customer disputes and acquisition costs related to business combinations.

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net mainly consists of movement of foreign currencies against the US dollar. 19 Income Taxes Three Months Ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ % Income tax expense $ 352 $ 398 $ 46 nm Effective tax rate 18.5 % 11.6 % nm - not meaningful For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months that we cannot anticipate. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements remain uncertain, we expect that, as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations, a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits including related penalties and interest is more likely than not to occur during the year ending March 31, 2024. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of the Company’s deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on various factors including the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the underlying temporary differences are deductible. We maintain valuation allowances for deferred tax assets until we have sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowances. Based on recent earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe it is reasonably possible that during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that a significant portion of our valuation allowances will no longer be needed. Releasing the valuation allowances would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and significant income tax benefits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, and payments of contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. At June 30, 2023, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 92% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $107.1 million as of June 30, 2023, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 22 $ 101 Investing activities (3,067 ) (105 ) Financing activities (2,702 ) (1,739 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2 ) (331 ) Decrease in cash $ (5,749 ) $ (2,074 ) 20 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $22 thousand in the first three months of fiscal 2024. The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $5.9 million and a decrease of $5.9 million due to changes in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash-based earnings is net income of $1.5 million plus $4.4 million of non-cash expenses including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first three months of fiscal 2024, the $2.7 million used in financing activities consisted primarily of $1.8 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $0.9 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2023, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023, other than the operating leases that commenced during the three months ended June 30, 2023, as described in Note 4, Additional Balance Sheet Information , to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2023. Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, as Principal Accounting Officer (“PAO”), management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and PAO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 21 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO, CFO and PAO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 22 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 1. Nature of Operations and Financial Statement Presentation Nature of Operations Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise solutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums, and healthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys also is known for its world-class customer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and India, with headquarters in Alpharetta, GA. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2023 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 23, 2022. Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to uncertainties. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. 8 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. We recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. We derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for our proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes the same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the contract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of payment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. 9 We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), subscription and maintenance and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 10.7 million and $ 32.3 million , and $ 8.1 million and $ 24.2 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue recognized over time (subscription and maintenance and professional services) totaled $ 39.2 million and $ 112.9 million , and $ 31.4 million and $ 91.8 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 9.4 million and $ 7.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 44.2 million and $ 36.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 1.7 million and $ 2.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.7 million and $ 3.1 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we expensed $ 1.1 million and $ 2.6 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.9 million , respectively. During the comparable periods ending December 31, 2021, we expensed $ 0.6 million and $ 1.8 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.9 million , respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 10 4. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 7,877 $ 7,870 Other taxes payable 2,894 1,994 Professional fees 546 373 Other 411 315 Total $ 11,728 $ 10,552 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,173 $ 1,154 Employee benefit obligations 2,641 2,037 Other 115 113 Total $ 3,929 $ 3,304 During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 , an operating lease commenced with a lease term of approximately eleven years . Accordingly, we reported the net lease obligation in operating lease liabilities and the associated operating lease right-of-use asset in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 . 5. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Cash (receipts) for interest, net $ ( 1,046 ) $ ( 6 ) Cash payments for income tax, net 912 631 Cash payments for operating leases 4,207 3,676 Cash payments for finance leases 4 15 Accrued capital expenditures 332 1 6. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income tax expense $ 678 $ 24 $ 920 $ 265 Effective tax rate 14.8 % 1.5 % 8.1 % 5.6 % For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first five years of operations, which included fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during its second five years of operations, which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded and maintain a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. 11 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In December 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth appealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 11, 2022, in accordance with its prior rulings, the District Court entered judgment in favor of us and against Ameranth on all claims asserted against us, however, Ameranth's appeal remains pending. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 8. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 3,892 $ 1,542 $ 10,507 $ 4,496 Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) ( 459 ) ( 1,377 ) ( 1,377 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,433 $ 1,083 $ 9,130 $ 3,119 Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,703 24,477 24,651 24,315 Dilutive SSARs 1,149 826 996 943 Dilutive unvested restricted shares 218 89 133 69 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 26,070 25,392 25,780 25,327 Income per share - basic: $ 0.14 $ 0.04 $ 0.37 $ 0.13 Income per share - diluted: $ 0.13 $ 0.04 $ 0.35 $ 0.12 Anti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 1,736 1,764 1,751 1,736 Basic income per share is computed as net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 459,306 and 231,199 of restricted shares at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income per share at the balance sheet dates. 12 Diluted income per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation grants because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (""2020 Plan"") for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The aggregate number of shares that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and performance share grants. We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Product development 2,108 2,217 5,770 6,033 Sales and marketing 257 345 822 1,011 General and administrative 1,101 1,277 2,818 3,758 Total share-based compensation expense 3,466 3,839 9,410 10,802 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price.

Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. 14 The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We pay dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. 11. Business Combination On January 5, 2022 (the acquisition date), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a Canada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of ResortSuite’s operations since the acquisition date. The acquisition extends our solutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The purchase price consisted of $ 22.6 million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand, partially offset by $ 0.3 million of ResortSuite’s cash received in the acquisition, $ 2.2 million of cash paid in March for certain ResortSuite tax liabilities, and $ 0.4 million in cash received in January 2023 upon release of escrow funds resulting in net cash consideration of $ 24.1 million. We allocated the purchase price for ResortSuite to the intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. We determined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach, which discounts the expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, we applied Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 to record certain customer accounts receivable and the contract liabilities assumed in the acquisition, which consisted of undelivered performance obligations under customer contracts. We adopted ASU 2021-08 early as permitted. As a result, in allocating the purchase price, we recorded $ 2.8 million of contract liabilities, representing the revenue that will be recognized as the underlying performance obligations are delivered. The following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of ResortSuite: (In thousands) Total Components of Purchase Price: Cash $ 24,405 Total purchase price $ 24,405 Allocation of Purchase Price: Net tangible assets (liabilities): Accounts receivable, net $ 2,025 Other current assets, including cash acquired 519 Other assets 567 Current and other liabilities ( 768 ) Contract liabilities ( 2,835 ) Deferred income taxes, non-current ( 1,204 ) Net tangible assets (liabilities) ( 1,696 ) Identifiable intangible assets: Customer relationships 9,634 Non-competition agreements 848 Developed technology 827 Trade names 846 Total identifiable intangible assets 12,155 Goodwill 13,946 Total purchase price allocation $ 24,405 We assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names estimated useful lives of 15 years , two years , five years , and five years , respectively, the weighted average of which is approximately 12.7 years. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives. 15 The goodwill recognized in the ResortSuite purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve a broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 13.9 million of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 , we increased goodwill by $ 0.8 million to record deferred income tax liabilities identified during the measurement period related to Canada tax treatment of certain intangible assets and to record final working capital adjustments related to the purchase price. The Company recognized acquisition costs of $ 0.2 million related to the acquisition of ResortSuite, consisting primarily of professional fees, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The condensed consolidated statement of operations includes these costs in other charges. Revenue attributable to ResortSuite included in our consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, was $ 1.4 million and $ 4.0 million . Effective April 1, 2022, ResortSuite became Agilysys Canada, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc. 16 Item 2.

Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The pandemic has created significant economic challenges as organizations and governmental authorities around the world have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border closings, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing requirements. Our customers and suppliers have closed or have otherwise applied restrictions at certain sites in response to the pandemic. Similarly, we have provided remote working arrangements for our employees, limited business travel, and canceled or shifted various events to virtual attendance. We have localized our pandemic response to the countries and specific locations in which we, our customers and our suppliers operate. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our business and on the operation of the global markets in general. We continue to monitor and evaluate the operational impact and may take further actions that alter our business operations that we believe are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.

Professional services revenue increased $2.8 million, or 45.7%, due to higher sales and service activity as our new and existing customers continue implementing technology to improve their operations.

Our total gross profit increased $6.1 million, or 24.5%, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and total gross profit margin decreased from 62.6% to 61.7% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022 driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $1.6 million, or 44.0%, and products gross profit margin increased from 45.7% to 49.8% due to a higher proportion of proprietary software deliveries. Subscription and maintenance gross profit increased $3.7 million, or 18.6%, and gross profit margin decreased from 78.4% to 77.6% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit margin increased from 20.9% to 22.7% reflecting improved utilization rates from efficiency gains on multi-solution implementations. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding other charges and legal settlements, increased $4.4 million, or 19.3%, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Product development. Product development increased $1.2 million, or 10.8%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due to hiring and increased salary and incentive rates across our development teams. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $1.9 million, or 49.3%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due to various sales and marketing investments including several key hires, higher levels of marketing event and trade show activity and increased commission expense on higher sales activity. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $1.1 million, or 16.5%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due to hiring and increased salary and incentive rates across our administrative teams, higher rent, and higher subscription charges for cloud computing arrangements. 20 Other charges.

Income Taxes Three Months Ended December 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Income tax expense $ 678 $ 24 $ (654 ) nm Effective tax rate 14.8 % 1.5 % nm - not meaningful For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. 21 Results of Operations First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023 Compared to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2022 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Nine Months Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 32,291 $ 24,244 $ 8,047 33.2 % Subscription and maintenance 86,917 72,371 14,546 20.1 % Professional services 25,960 19,463 6,497 33.4 % Total net revenue 145,168 116,078 29,090 25.1 % Cost of goods sold: Products 16,682 12,420 4,262 34.3 % Subscription and maintenance 19,223 15,184 4,039 26.6 % Professional services 20,627 14,634 5,993 41.0 % Total cost of goods sold 56,532 42,238 14,294 33.8 % Gross profit $ 88,636 $ 73,840 $ 14,796 20.0 % Gross profit margin 61.1 % 63.6 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 36,550 $ 34,074 $ 2,476 7.3 % Sales and marketing 16,619 10,418 6,201 59.5 % General and administrative 22,850 20,330 2,520 12.4 % Depreciation of fixed assets 1,371 1,609 (238 ) (14.8 )% Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 1,326 1,077 249 23.1 % Other charges 374 1,187 (813 ) (68.5 )% Legal settlements 104 371 (267 ) nm Operating income $ 9,442 $ 4,774 $ 4,668 97.8 % Operating income percentage 6.5 % 4.1 % nm - not meaningful The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: 22 Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net revenue: Products 22.2 % 20.9 % Subscription and maintenance 59.9 62.3 Professional services 17.9 16.8 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.5 % 10.7 % Subscription and maintenance 13.2 13.1 Professional services 14.2 12.6 Total net cost of goods sold 38.9 % 36.4 % Gross profit 61.1 % 63.6 % Operating expenses: Product development 25.2 % 29.4 % Sales and marketing 11.5 9.0 General and administrative 15.7 17.5 Depreciation of fixed assets 0.9 1.4 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.9 0.9 Other charges 0.3 1.0 Legal settlements 0.1 0.3 Operating income 6.5 % 4.1 % Net revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures and payments of contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. At December 31, 2022, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 92% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million as of December 31, 2022, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. 24 Cash Flow Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 17,680 $ 21,815 Investing activities (3,643 ) (1,081 ) Financing activities (4,763 ) (4,754 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (427 ) (38 ) Increase in cash $ 8,847 $ 15,942 Cash flow provided by operating activities.

The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $22.3 million and a decrease of $4.6 million due to changes in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash-based earnings is net income of $10.5 million plus $11.8 million of non-cash expenses including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the $4.8 million used in financing activities consisted primarily of $2.9 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.8 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2022, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022, other than the operating lease that commenced during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as described in Note 4, Additional Balance Sheet Information , to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2022. Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 25 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2022. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Significant portions of our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote operation with access to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 26 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The pandemic has created significant economic challenges as organizations and governmental authorities around the world have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border closings, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing requirements. Our customers and vendors have closed or have otherwise applied restrictions at certain sites in response to the pandemic. Similarly, we have provided remote working arrangements for our employees, limited business travel, and canceled or shifted various events to virtual attendance. We have localized our pandemic response to the countries and specific locations in which we, our customers and our vendors operate. See Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview— Recent Developments” of this report for more discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2023 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 23, 2022. Use of estimates 8 Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to uncertainties. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. We recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. We derive maintenance service revenue from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for our proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation. Maintenance revenue includes the same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. We recognize substantially all maintenance revenue over the contract period of the maintenance agreement. We also recognize certain maintenance service revenue based on the volume of payment transactions processed by third parties through access to our software. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. 9 We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), subscription and maintenance and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 10.5 million and $ 21.6 million , and $ 7.3 million and $ 16.1 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue recognized over time (subscription and maintenance and professional services) totaled $ 37.2 million and $ 73.7 million , and $ 30.6 million and $ 60.5 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 13.9 million and $ 12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 34.7 million and $ 29.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 1.6 million and $ 2.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2022 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.4 million and $ 3.1 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2022, we expensed $ 0.8 million and $ 1.5 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.6 million , respectively. During the comparable periods ending September 30, 2021, we expensed $ 0.5 million and $ 1.2 million , respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.6 million , respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 10 4. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) September 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 7,650 $ 7,870 Other taxes payable 1,745 1,994 Professional fees 242 373 Other 322 315 Total $ 9,959 $ 10,552 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,166 $ 1,154 Deferred rent and asset retirement obligations 43 43 Employee benefit obligations 2,548 2,037 Other 72 70 Total $ 3,829 $ 3,304 During the three months ended September 30, 2022 , an operating lease commenced with a lease term of approximately eleven years . Accordingly, we recorded the net lease obligation in operating lease liabilities and the associated operating lease right-of-use asset in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 . 5. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Cash (receipts) for interest, net $ ( 407 ) $ ( 13 ) Cash payments for income tax, net 624 439 Cash payments for operating leases 2,619 2,308 Cash payments for finance leases 3 10 Accrued capital expenditures 270 45 6. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income tax (benefit) expense $ ( 158 ) $ 48 $ 240 $ 241 Effective tax rate ( 4.6 )% 4.7 % 3.5 % 7.5 % For the three and six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first five years of operations, which included fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during its second five years of operations, which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded and maintain a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize 11 the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2022. 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In December 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth appealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 11, 2022, in accordance with its prior rulings, the District Court entered judgment in favor of us and against Ameranth on all claims asserted against us, however, Ameranth's appeal remains pending. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 8. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 3,576 $ 982 $ 6,615 $ 2,954 Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) ( 459 ) ( 918 ) ( 918 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,117 $ 523 $ 5,697 $ 2,036 Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,652 24,451 24,625 24,233 Dilutive SSARs 992 892 881 1,005 Dilutive unvested restricted shares 139 66 85 58 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,783 25,409 25,591 25,296 Income per share - basic: $ 0.13 $ 0.02 $ 0.23 $ 0.08 Income per share - diluted: $ 0.12 $ 0.02 $ 0.22 $ 0.08 Anti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 1,735 1,735 1,736 1,735 Basic income per share is computed as net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 377,491 and 139,332 of restricted 12 shares at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation grants because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (""2020 Plan"") for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The aggregate number of shares that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and performance share grants. We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Product development 2,141 1,751 3,662 3,816 Sales and marketing 290 335 565 666 General and administrative 1,025 1,256 1,717 2,481 Total share-based compensation expense 3,456 3,342 5,944 6,963 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. 13 The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2022 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2022 2,172,939 $ 24.02 Granted — — Exercised ( 201,612 ) 17.77 Forfeited ( 24,762 ) 20.02 Expired — — Outstanding at September 30, 2022 1,946,565 $ 24.72 3.9 $ 59,618 Exercisable at September 30, 2022 1,619,517 $ 24.82 3.8 $ 49,439 Vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2022 1,946,565 $ 24.72 3.9 $ 59,618 As of September 30, 2022, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested service condition SSARs was $ 1.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 0.5 years. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted shares are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2022 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2022 147,973 $ 43.56 Granted 253,968 42.94 Vested ( 15,878 ) 44.70 Forfeited ( 8,572 ) 44.67 Outstanding at September 30, 2022 377,491 $ 43.09 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares includes grants subject only to a service condition and certain grants subject to both a service condition and a market condition. As of September 30, 2022, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted shares was $ 11.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.4 years. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted 5,384 common shares to our Chief Executive Officer in May 2022 that vested immediately for a total value of $ 0.2 million. 10. Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. 14 The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We pay dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. 11. Business Combination On January 5, 2022 (the acquisition date), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a Canada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of ResortSuite’s operations since the acquisition date. The acquisition extends our solutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The purchase price consisted of $ 22.6 million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand, partially offset by $ 0.3 million of ResortSuite’s cash received in the acquisition, and $ 2.2 million of cash paid in March for certain ResortSuite tax liabilities resulting in net cash consideration of $ 24.5 million. We allocated the purchase price for ResortSuite to the intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. We determined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach, which discounts the expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, we applied Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 to record certain customer accounts receivable and the contract liabilities assumed in the acquisition, which consisted of undelivered performance obligations under customer contracts. We adopted ASU 2021-08 early as permitted. As a result, in allocating the purchase price, we recorded $ 2.8 million of contract liabilities, representing the revenue that will be recognized as the underlying performance obligations are delivered. The following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of ResortSuite: (In thousands) Total Components of Purchase Price: Cash $ 24,800 Total purchase price $ 24,800 Allocation of Purchase Price: Net tangible assets (liabilities): Accounts receivable, net $ 2,025 Other current assets, including cash acquired 519 Other assets 567 Current and other liabilities ( 768 ) Contract liabilities ( 2,835 ) Net tangible assets (liabilities) ( 492 ) Identifiable intangible assets: Customer relationships 9,634 Non-competition agreements 848 Developed technology 827 Trade names 846 Total identifiable intangible assets 12,155 Goodwill 13,137 Total purchase price allocation $ 24,800 We assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names estimated useful lives of 15 years , two years , five years , and five years , respectively, the weighted average of which is approximately 12.7 years. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives. The goodwill recognized in the ResortSuite purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve a broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 13.1 million of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 15 The Company recognized acquisition costs of $ 0.1 million related to the acquisition of ResortSuite, consisting primarily of professional fees, during the six months ended September 30, 2022. The condensed consolidated statement of operations includes these costs in other charges. Revenue attributable to ResortSuite included in our consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, was $ 1.3 million and $ 2.6 million . Net income was not material. We have prepared the purchase price allocation for ResortSuite on a preliminary basis. Changes to the allocation may occur as additional information becomes available during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Effective April 1, 2022, ResortSuite became Agilysys Canada, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc. 16 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 24 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. While we have previously taken certain cost reduction measures, we may take further actions that alter our business operations in response to changes in the global environment. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys is well known for its long heritage of hospitality-focused technology innovation. The Company delivers modular and integrated software solutions and expertise to businesses seeking to maximize Return on Experience (ROE) through hospitality encounters that are both personal and profitable. Over time, customers achieve High Return Hospitality by consistently delighting guests, retaining staff and growing margins. Customers around the world include: branded and independent hotels; multi-amenity resort properties; casinos; property, hotel and resort management companies; cruise lines; corporate dining providers; higher education campus dining providers; food service management companies; hospitals; lifestyle communities; senior living facilities; stadiums; and theme parks. The Agilysys Hospitality Cloud combines core operational systems for property management (PMS), point-of-sale (POS) and Inventory and Procurement (I&P) with Experience Enhancers that meaningfully improve interactions for guests and for employees across dimensions such as digital access, mobile convenience, self-service control, personal choice, payment options, service coverage and real-time insights to improve decisions.

To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to existing software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, increasing profitability and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry-leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, subscription and maintenance revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Total net revenue increased $9.9 million, or 26.0%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Products revenue increased $3.2 million, or 44.5%, due to higher sales and deliveries to new customers and expansion with existing customers. Subscription and maintenance revenue increased $5.0 million, or 20.8%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 28.6% during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Professional services revenue increased $1.6 million, or 24.2%, due to higher sales and service activity as our new and existing customers continue implementing technology to improve their operations. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $5.1 million, or 21.1%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and total gross profit margin decreased from 64.0% to 61.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $1.5 million, or 40.5%, and products gross profit margin decreased from 49.9% to 48.5% due to the composition of hardware products delivered. Subscription and maintenance gross profit increased $3.9 million, or 20.3%, and gross profit margin decreased from 79.1% to 78.8% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit margin decreased from 24.5% to 17.0% reflecting lower utilization rates due to higher non-billable hours on new, more complex multi-solution implementations. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding other charges and legal settlements, increased $4.2 million, or 18.7%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Product development. Product development increased $1.2 million, or 10.5%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to hiring and increased salary rates across our development teams. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $1.9 million, or 55.4%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to various sales and marketing investments including several key hires, significantly higher levels of marketing event and trade show activity and increased commission expense on higher sales activity. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $1.0 million, or 16.1%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to hiring and increased salary rates across our administrative teams including information security, information technology, and business operations. 20 Other charges. Other charges consist of severance costs, infrequent settlements of customer disputes and acquisition costs related to business combinations.

Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other (income) expense, net. Other (income) expense, net mainly consists of movement of foreign currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three Months Ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Income tax (benefit) expense $ (158 ) $ 48 $ 206 429.2 % Effective tax rate (4.6 )% 4.7 % nm - not meaningful For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. 21 Results of Operations First Half Fiscal 2023 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2022 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the six months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021: Six Months Ended September 30, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 21,594 $ 16,143 $ 5,451 33.8 % Subscription and maintenance 56,763 47,234 9,529 20.2 % Professional services 16,891 13,240 3,651 27.6 % Total net revenue 95,248 76,617 18,631 24.3 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11,314 8,020 3,294 41.1 % Subscription and maintenance 12,456 9,763 2,693 27.6 % Professional services 13,618 9,711 3,907 40.2 % Total cost of goods sold 37,388 27,494 9,894 36.0 % Gross profit $ 57,860 $ 49,123 $ 8,737 17.8 % Gross profit margin 60.7 % 64.1 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 24,134 $ 22,864 $ 1,270 5.6 % Sales and marketing 10,733 6,475 4,258 65.8 % General and administrative 14,922 13,526 1,396 10.3 % Depreciation of fixed assets 934 1,114 (180 ) (16.2 )% Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 896 810 86 10.6 % Other charges 281 805 (524 ) (65.1 )% Legal settlements - 367 (367 ) nm Operating income $ 5,960 $ 3,162 $ 2,798 88.5 % Operating income percentage 6.3 % 4.1 % nm - not meaningful The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: 22 Six Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Net revenue: Products 22.7 % 21.1 % Subscription and maintenance 59.6 61.6 Professional services 17.7 17.3 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.9 % 10.5 % Subscription and maintenance 13.1 12.7 Professional services 14.3 12.7 Total net cost of goods sold 39.3 % 35.9 % Gross profit 60.7 % 64.1 % Operating expenses: Product development 25.3 % 29.8 % Sales and marketing 11.2 8.5 General and administrative 15.7 17.7 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.0 1.3 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.9 1.1 Other charges 0.3 1.1 Legal settlements - 0.5 Operating income 6.3 % 4.1 % Net revenue.

We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures and payments of contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. At September 30, 2022, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 93% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents of $96.2 million as of September 30, 2022, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. 24 Cash Flow Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,117 $ 11,673 Investing activities (799 ) (788 ) Financing activities (2,375 ) (3,638 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (718 ) (38 ) (Decrease) increase in cash $ (775 ) $ 7,209 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $3.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023. The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $6.6 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $7.5 million including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, and a decrease of $11.0 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first six months of fiscal 2023, the $2.4 million used in financing activities consisted primarily of $1.5 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $0.9 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2022, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022, other than the operating lease that commenced during the three months ended September 30, 2022, as described in Note 4, Additional Balance Sheet Information , to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2022. Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2022. 25 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the six months ended September 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Significant portions of our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote operation with access to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 26 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The pandemic has created significant economic challenges as organizations and governmental authorities around the world have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border closings, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing requirements. Our customers and vendors have closed or have otherwise applied restrictions at certain sites in response to the pandemic. Similarly, we have provided remote working arrangements for our employees, limited business travel, and canceled or shifted various events to virtual attendance. We have localized our pandemic response to the countries and specific locations in which we, our customers and our vendors operate. See Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview— Recent Developments” of this report for more discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2023 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 23, 2022. Use of estimates 8 Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our proprietary software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. We recognize revenue for hardware sales when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. We recognize maintenance service revenue primarily from providing unspecified updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and technical support services for our on-premise proprietary software. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Maintenance revenue also includes the same services provided by third-parties for remarketed software. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. 9 We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), subscription and maintenance and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 11.0 million and $ 8.8 million , and over time (subscription and maintenance and professional services) totaled $ 36.5 million and $ 29.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 20.9 million and $ 17.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 1.5 million and $ 2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of June 30, 2022 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.3 million and $ 2.9 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , we expensed $ 0.7 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 10 4. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) June 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 5,170 $ 7,870 Other taxes payable 2,164 1,994 Professional fees 144 373 Other 392 315 Total $ 7,870 $ 10,552 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,160 $ 1,154 Deferred rent and asset retirement obligations 43 43 Employee benefit obligations 2,517 2,037 Other 72 70 Total $ 3,792 $ 3,304 5. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Three Months Ended June, 30 (In thousands) 2022 2021 Cash (receipts) for interest, net $ ( 100 ) $ ( 21 ) Cash payments for income tax, net 332 192 Cash payments for operating leases 1,468 969 Cash payments for finance leases 2 5 Accrued capital expenditures 158 24 6. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended June 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 398 $ 193 Effective tax rate 11.6 % 8.9 % For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first five years of operations, which included fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. The India subsidiary is subject to 50 % of regular India income taxes during its second five years of operations, which includes fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2027. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded and maintain a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2022. 11 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. This judgment affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in November 2019 with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys, and Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. In December 2021, the District Court denied Ameranth’s motion to assert additional claims against the defendants. In March 2022, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants still facing the remaining claims. Subsequently, Ameranth appealed the grant of summary judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 11, 2022, in accordance with its prior rulings, the District Court entered judgment in favor of us and against Ameranth on all claims asserted against us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. As of June 30, 2022 , we have an additional operating lease that has not yet commenced of approximately $ 11.7 million. This operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2023 with a lease term of approximately eleven years . 8. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 3,039 $ 1,972 Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) ( 459 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 2,580 $ 1,513 Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,598 24,014 Dilutive SSARs 728 1,115 Dilutive unvested restricted shares 44 49 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,370 25,178 Income per share - basic: $ 0.10 $ 0.06 Income per share - diluted: $ 0.10 $ 0.06 Anti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 1,797 1,735 Basic income per share is computed as net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 390,361 and 138,736 of restricted shares at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income per share at the balance sheet dates. 12 Diluted income per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation grants because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (""2020 Plan"") for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The aggregate number of shares that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and performance share grants. We record compensation expense related to SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share grants subject only to a service condition is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. Under the 2020 Plan, the fair value of performance shares is based on the closing price of our common shares on the settlement date of the performance award, for which we record compensation expense over the service period consistent with our annual bonus incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Product development 1,521 2,065 Sales and marketing 275 331 General and administrative 692 1,225 Total share-based compensation expense 2,488 3,621 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. 13 The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2022 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2022 2,172,939 $ 24.02 Granted — — Exercised ( 114,360 ) 16.04 Forfeited ( 19,171 ) 20.02 Expired — — Outstanding at June 30, 2022 2,039,408 $ 24.51 4.2 $ 46,419 Exercisable at June 30, 2022 1,528,171 $ 24.50 4.1 $ 34,802 Vested and expected to vest at June 30, 2022 2,039,408 $ 24.51 4.2 $ 46,419 As of June 30, 2022, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested service condition SSARs was $ 2.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 0.8 years. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted shares are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2022 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2022 147,973 $ 43.56 Granted 252,707 42.91 Vested ( 7,434 ) 36.68 Forfeited ( 2,885 ) 45.76 Outstanding at June 30, 2022 390,361 $ 43.25 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares includes grants subject only to a service condition and certain grants subject to both a service condition and a market condition. As of June 30, 2022, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock was $ 13.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.7 years. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted 5,384 common shares to our Chief Executive Officer in May 2022 that vested immediately for a total value of $ 0.2 million. 10. Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. 14 The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We pay dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. 11. Business Combination On January 5, 2022 (the acquisition date), we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a Canada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of ResortSuite’s operations since the acquisition date. The acquisition extends our solutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The purchase price consisted of $ 22.6 million of cash paid at closing, funded from cash on hand, partially offset by $ 0.3 million of ResortSuite’s cash received in the acquisition, and $ 2.2 million of cash paid in March for certain ResortSuite tax liabilities resulting in net cash consideration of $ 24.5 million. We allocated the purchase price for ResortSuite to the intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. We determined the fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach, which discounts the expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, we applied Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 to record certain customer accounts receivable and the contract liabilities assumed in the acquisition, which consisted of undelivered performance obligations under customer contracts. We adopted ASU 2021-08 early as permitted. As a result, in allocating the purchase price, we recorded $ 2.8 million of contract liabilities, representing the revenue that will be recognized as the underlying performance obligations are delivered. The following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of ResortSuite: (In thousands) Total Components of Purchase Price: Cash $ 24,800 Total purchase price $ 24,800 Allocation of Purchase Price: Net tangible assets (liabilities): Accounts receivable, net $ 2,025 Other current assets, including cash acquired 519 Other assets 567 Current and other liabilities ( 768 ) Contract liabilities ( 2,835 ) Net tangible assets (liabilities) ( 492 ) Identifiable intangible assets: Customer relationships 9,634 Non-competition agreements 848 Developed technology 827 Trade names 846 Total identifiable intangible assets 12,155 Goodwill 13,137 Total purchase price allocation $ 24,800 We assigned the acquired customer relationships, non-competition agreements, developed technology, and trade names estimated useful lives of 15 years , two years , five years , and five years , respectively, the weighted average of which is approximately 12.7 years. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized, over their estimated useful lives. The goodwill recognized in the ResortSuite purchase price allocation is attributable to synergies in products and technologies to serve a broader customer base, and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 13.1 million of goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 15 The Company recognized acquisition costs of $ 0.1 million related to the acquisition of ResortSuite, consisting primarily of professional fees, during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The condensed consolidated statement of operations includes these costs in other charges. Revenue attributable to ResortSuite included in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $ 1.3 million . Net income was not material. We have prepared the purchase price allocation for ResortSuite on a preliminary basis. Changes to the allocation may occur as additional information becomes available during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Effective April 1, 2022, ResortSuite became Agilysys Canada, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc. 16 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 24 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. While we have previously taken certain cost reduction measures, we may take further actions that alter our business operations in response to changes in the global environment. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise solutions for hotels, resorts and cruise lines, casinos, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadiums, and healthcare. The Company’s software solutions include point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications that manage and enhance the entire guest journey. Agilysys also is known for its world-class customer-centric service. Many of the top hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth, and increase operational efficiencies. The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia. Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to existing software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. 17 Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, increasing profitability and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, subscription and maintenance revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: 18 Results of Operations First Fiscal Quarter 2023 Compared to First Fiscal Quarter 2022 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended June 30, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 11,046 $ 8,844 $ 2,202 24.9 % Subscription and maintenance 27,727 23,207 4,520 19.5 % Professional services 8,733 6,674 2,059 30.9 % Total net revenue 47,506 38,725 8,781 22.7 % Cost of goods sold: Products 5,879 4,360 1,519 34.8 % Subscription and maintenance 6,286 4,744 1,542 32.5 % Professional services 6,846 4,754 2,092 44.0 % Total cost of goods sold 19,011 13,858 5,153 37.2 % Gross profit $ 28,495 $ 24,867 $ 3,628 14.6 % Gross profit margin 60.0 % 64.2 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 11,556 $ 11,485 $ 71 0.6 % Sales and marketing 5,413 3,052 2,361 77.4 % General and administrative 7,353 7,003 350 5.0 % Depreciation of fixed assets 473 566 (93 ) (16.4 )% Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 453 465 (12 ) (2.6 )% Other charges 214 225 (11 ) nm Legal settlements 0 30 (30 ) nm Operating income $ 3,033 $ 2,041 $ 992 48.6 % Operating income percentage 6.4 % 5.3 % nm - not meaningful 19 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Net revenue: Products 23.2 % 22.8 % Subscription and maintenance 58.4 59.9 Professional services 18.4 17.3 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 12.4 % 11.3 % Subscription and maintenance 13.2 12.3 Professional services 14.4 12.2 Total net cost of goods sold 40.0 % 35.8 % Gross profit 60.0 % 64.2 % Operating expenses: Product development 24.3 % 29.7 % Sales and marketing 11.4 7.9 General and administrative 15.5 18.1 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.0 1.3 Amortization of internal-use software and intangibles 0.9 1.2 Other charges 0.5 0.6 Legal settlements 0.0 0.1 Operating income 6.4 % 5.3 % nm - not meaningful Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $8.8 million, or 22.7%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Products revenue increased $2.2 million, or 24.9%, due to higher sales and deliveries to new customers and expansion with existing customers. Subscription and maintenance revenue increased $4.5 million, or 19.5%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 29.5% during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Professional services revenue increased $2.1 million, or 30.9%, due to higher sales and service activity as our new and existing customers continue implementing technology to improve their operations. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $3.6 million, or 14.6%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and total gross profit margin decreased from 64.2% to 60.0% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $0.7 million, or 15.2%, and products gross profit margin decreased from 50.7% to 46.8% due to a higher proportion of third-party products over proprietary software revenue. Subscription and maintenance gross profit increased $3.0 million, or 16.1%, and gross profit margin decreased from 79.6% to 77.3% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit margin decreased from 28.8% to 21.6% as we continue to invest in and train new service team members to meet the growing installation and implementation activity. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding other charges and legal settlements, increased $2.7 million, or 11.9%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Product development. Product development increased $0.1 million, or 0.6%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2022 due to increases in salary rates across our development teams. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $2.4 million, or 77.4%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2022 due to various sales and marketing investments including several key hires and significantly higher levels of marketing event and trade show activity. General and administrative. General and administrative increased $0.4 million, or 5.0%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2022 due to investments in our information security and information technology infrastructure. 20 Other charges. Other charges consist of severance costs, infrequent settlements of customer disputes and acquisition costs related to business combinations. Other (Income) Expenses Three Months Ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Other (income) expense: Interest income $ (101 ) $ (22 ) $ 79 nm Interest expense 1 1 — nm Other income, net (304 ) (103 ) 201 nm Total other (income) expense, net $ (404 ) $ (124 ) $ 280 nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense, net. Other expense, net mainly consists of movement of foreign currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three Months Ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 $ % Income tax expense (benefit) $ 398 $ 193 $ (205 ) (106.2 )% Effective tax rate 11.6 % 8.9 % nm - not meaningful For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to deferred tax assets and to valuation allowances that reduce deferred tax assets and to the recording of net operating losses in a number of foreign jurisdictions offset by current year expense in other foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, capital expenditures, payments of preferred stock dividends, and operating expenses including payments of lease obligations. Our contractual obligations consist primarily of operating leases for office space and preferred stock dividends. At June 30, 2022, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 93% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including commercial paper and treasury bills with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less and money market funds. We determine the fair value of commercial paper using significant other observable inputs based on pricing from independent sources that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or other 21 observable inputs including benchmark yields and interest rates. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents of $94.9 million as of June 30, 2022, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 101 $ 7,995 Investing activities (105 ) (276 ) Financing activities (1,739 ) (2,994 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (331 ) 6 (Decrease) increase in cash $ (2,074 ) $ 4,731 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $0.1 million in the first three months of fiscal 2023. The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $3.0 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $3.3 million including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, and a decrease of $6.2 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first three months of fiscal 2023, the $1.7 million used in financing activities consisted primarily of $0.8 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $0.9 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2022, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2022. Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 22 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2022. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant portions of our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote operation with access to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 23 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. See Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview— Recent Developments” of this report for more discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2022 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 21, 2021. Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Considering the currently unknown extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply to certain of our significant accounting policies. We assessed certain 8 Table of Contents accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to us and the unknown future impacts COVID-19 as of December 3 1 , 202 1 and through the date of this report. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities From Contracts With Customers , which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 to require acquiring entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. The ASU is intended to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability as well as the payment terms and their impact on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We intend to adopt ASU 2021-08 during the three months ending March 31, 2022 – see Note 11, Business Combination . In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We adopted ASU 2020-06 as of April 1, 2021 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes, and is meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years . We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of April 1, 2021 with no material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. 9 Table of Contents Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled . H ardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory . W e are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 8.1 million and $ 24.2 million, and $ 7.6 million and $ 19.4 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $ 31.4 million and $ 91.8 million, and $ 29.1 million and $ 81.4 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 7.5 million and $ 9.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively and $ 36.9 million and $ 38.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 2.3 million and $ 1.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 10 Table of Contents Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2021 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.1 million and $ 2.9 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we expensed $ 0.6 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.9 million, respectively. During the comparable periods ending December 31, 2020, we expensed $ 0.7 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 4. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) December 31, 2021 March 31, 2021 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 5,687 $ 8,454 Other taxes payable 1,989 1,796 Accrued legal settlements — 200 Severance liabilities 7 79 Professional fees 428 97 Other 274 607 Total $ 8,385 $ 11,233 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,148 $ 1,129 Asset retirement obligations 43 170 Employee benefit obligations 2,386 2,639 Other 70 73 Total $ 3,647 $ 4,011 5. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 Cash receipts for interest, net $ ( 6 ) $ ( 63 ) Cash payments for income taxes, net 631 195 Cash payments for operating leases 3,676 4,039 Cash payments for finance leases 15 21 Accrued capital expenditures 1 64 11 Table of Contents 6. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income tax expense $ 24 $ 182 $ 265 $ 311 Effective tax rate 1.5 % ( 9.6 )% 5.6 % 8.7 % For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses that were offset by increased valuation allowance in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the nine months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the utilization of net operating losses that were offset by decreased valuation allowance in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded and maintain a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50 % due December 31, 2022 . The company paid $ 0.9 million in deferred social security taxes during December 2021. 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. Subsequently, Ameranth filed further pleading amendments and discovery requests with the District Court, which were opposed by the defendants. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgement ruling may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. As of December 31, 2021, we have an additional operating lease that has not yet commenced of approximately $ 11.7 million. This operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2023 with a lease term of approximately eleven years . 12 Table of Contents 8. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 1,542 $ ( 2,070 ) $ 4,496 $ 3,280 Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs — — — ( 1,031 ) Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) ( 459 ) ( 1,377 ) ( 1,117 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 1,083 $ ( 2,529 ) $ 3,119 $ 1,132 Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,477 23,429 24,315 23,419 Dilutive SSARs 826 — 943 377 Dilutive unvested restricted shares 89 — 69 107 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,392 23,429 25,327 23,903 Income (loss) per share - basic: $ 0.04 $ ( 0.11 ) $ 0.13 $ 0.05 Income (loss) per share - diluted: $ 0.04 $ ( 0.11 ) $ 0.12 $ 0.05 Anti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares and preferred shares 1,764 4,513 1,736 2,692 Basic income (loss) per share is computed as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 231,199 and 204,009 of restricted shares at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income (loss) per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation grants because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (""2020 Plan"") for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The aggregate number of shares that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and performance share grants. The fair value of restricted share grants subject only to a service condition and performance share grants is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject only to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. For restricted share and SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, share price threshold and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. Inputs for SSAR grants subject to a market condition also include exercise price, remaining contractual term, and suboptimal exercise factor. We record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition using the graded vesting method. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject only to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. 13 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Product development $ 2,217 $ 3,362 $ 6,033 $ 3,773 Sales and marketing 345 666 1,011 735 General and administrative 1,277 2,602 3,758 4,804 Total share-based compensation expense $ 3,839 $ 6,630 $ 10,802 $ 9,312 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2021 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) (in thousands) Outstanding at April 1, 2021 3,068,253 $ 20.90 Exercised ( 820,341 ) 12.72 Forfeited ( 49,750 ) 20.02 Expired ( 246 ) 14.22 Outstanding at December 31, 2021 2,197,916 $ 23.97 4.9 $ 45,041 Exercisable at December 31, 2021 1,262,704 $ 23.54 4.7 $ 26,421 Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2021 2,197,916 $ 23.97 4.9 $ 45,041 As of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested service condition SSARs was $ 6.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.2 years. As of December 31, 2021, there was no unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested market condition SSARs. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. Certain restricted shares are also subject to a market condition. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2021 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2021 132,198 $ 37.67 Granted 108,473 43.77 Vested ( 1,056 ) 52.29 Forfeited ( 8,416 ) 37.66 Outstanding at December 31, 2021 231,199 $ 40.34 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares includes grants subject only to a service condition and certain grants subject to both a service condition and a market condition. As of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock was $ 5.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.3 years. 14 Table of Contents Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted 3,403 common shares to our Chief Executive Officer in May 2021 that vested immediately for a total value of $ 0.2 million. 10. Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We pay dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. 11. Business Combination In December 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ResortSuite Inc. (“ResortSuite”), a Canada-based fully integrated property management solutions provider focused on the complex multi-amenity and resort market. The acquisition extends our solutions to customers in the complex multi-amenity and resort market. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to pay approximately $ 25 million in cash consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares of ResortSuite. The Company is funding the consideration with cash on the Company’s balance sheet. The acquisition closed on January 5, 2022, with a closing payment of $ 22.7 million. The Company expects to record a total purchase price of approximately $ 25 million after payment of certain pre-closing tax liabilities. As a result of the acquisition, ResortSuite has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilysys, Inc. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred immaterial acquisition-related expenses associated with the acquisition of ResortSuite, which were recorded in severance and other charges. The initial accounting for this acquisition is not complete due to the timing of the transaction and the pending measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the January 5, 2022 acquisition date. 15 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 24 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. We have taken actions to mitigate the impact on our business. We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization of customer and employee events, and partially remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may continue to delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. The pandemic could have an ongoing adverse impact on demand for our customers’ products and services, which in turn could negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations timely, which negatively impacts our ability to recognize revenue. While we have previously taken certain cost reduction measures, we may take further actions that alter our business operations in response to changes in the global environment. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative modern cloud native SaaS and on-premise guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia and healthcare.

Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances. • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Third Fiscal Quarter 2022 Compared to Third Fiscal Quarter 2021 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Three months ended December 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 8,101 $ 7,599 $ 502 6.6 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 25,136 22,846 2,290 10.0 Professional services 6,223 6,230 (7 ) nm Total net revenue 39,460 36,675 2,785 7.6 Cost of goods sold: Products 4,400 3,660 740 20.2 Support, maintenance and subscription services 5,421 4,655 766 16.5 Professional services 4,923 4,164 759 18.2 Total cost of goods sold 14,744 12,479 2,265 18.2 Gross profit $ 24,716 $ 24,196 $ 520 2.1 % Gross profit margin 62.6 % 66.0 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 11,210 $ 12,376 $ (1,166 ) (9.4 )% Sales and marketing 3,943 3,327 616 18.5 General and administrative 6,804 7,509 (705 ) (9.4 ) Depreciation of fixed assets 495 722 (227 ) (31.4 ) Amortization of internal-use software 267 521 (254 ) (48.8 ) Severance and other charges 381 1,552 (1,171 ) (75.5 ) Legal settlements, net 4 - 4 nm Operating income (loss) $ 1,612 $ (1,811 ) $ 3,423 189.0 % Operating income (loss) percentage 4.1 % (4.9 )% nm - not meaningful 18 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended December 31, 2021 2020 Net revenue: Products 20.5 % 20.7 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 63.7 62.3 Professional services 15.8 17.0 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.2 % 10.0 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 13.7 12.7 Professional services 12.5 11.3 Total cost of goods sold 37.4 % 34.0 % Gross profit 62.6 % 66.0 % Operating expenses: Product development 28.4 % 33.7 % Sales and marketing 10.0 9.1 General and administrative 17.2 20.5 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.2 2.0 Amortization of internal-use software 0.7 1.4 Severance and other charges 1.0 4.2 Legal settlements, net 0.0 — Operating income (loss) 4.1 % (4.9 )% nm - not meaningful Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $2.8 million, or 7.6%, during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Products revenue increased $0.5 million, or 6.6%, due to higher sales and deliveries as our customers re-open their locations for business. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $2.3 million, or 10.0%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 24.9% during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in subscription revenue is due to increased sales and implementations of our newer cloud native add-on modules. Professional services revenue was consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as customers continue to struggle with labor availability causing delay in certain projects during the quarter while complex implementations require additional time for completion. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $0.5 million, or 2.1%, for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and total gross profit margin decreased from 66.0% to 62.6% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit decreased $0.2 million, or 6.0%, and products gross profit margin decreased from 51.8% to 45.7% due to a higher proportion of third-party products over proprietary software revenue. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $1.5 million, or 8.4%, and gross profit margin decreased from 79.6% to 78.4% as certain variable costs increased ahead of related revenue. Professional services gross profit decreased $0.8 million due to delays in certain professional service projects with a decrease in gross profit margin from 33.2% to 20.9% due to an increase in costs as our implementation teams continue to hire and train new staff while project backlogs increase from ongoing sales activity and certain project delays. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, severance and other charges, decreased $1.7 million, or 7.1%, during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Product development. Product development decreased $1.2 million, or 9.4%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2021 due to higher than usual share-based and other incentive compensation in the prior year which did not reoccur in the current fiscal year. 19 Table of Contents Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing in creased $0.6 million , or 18.5 % , in the third quarter of fiscal 202 2 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 20 2 1 due to the return of some travel costs due to increased in-person selling activity , and higher advertising and promotions costs due to increased marketing event and trade show activity . General and administrative. General and administrative decreased $0.7 million, or 9.4%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2021 due to higher than usual share-based compensation in the prior year which did not reoccur in the current fiscal year. Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges decreased $1.2 million, or 75.5%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2021 due to the absence of layoffs and significantly reduced employee terminations in fiscal 2022.

For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses that were offset by increased valuation allowance in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of 20 Table of Contents these deductible differences . The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible .

For the nine months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the utilization of net operating losses that were offset by decreases in the valuation allowances in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures and payments on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease obligations and preferred stock dividends. At December 31, 2021, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 95% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments including money market funds and commercial paper with original maturity 23 Table of Contents from the date of acquisition of three months or less . We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. As of December 31, 2021, and March 31, 2021, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $115.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements including the acquisition of ResortSuite, which is expected to total approximately $25 million of which Agilysys paid $22.7 million in January 2022. Cash Flow Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 21,815 $ 15,084 Investing activities (1,081 ) (1,078 ) Financing activities (4,754 ) 31,765 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (38 ) 184 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 15,942 $ 45,955 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $21.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022. The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $17.6 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $13.1 million including loss on disposal of property & equipment, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, and an increase of $4.2 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow (used in) provided by financing activities. During the first nine months of fiscal 2022, the $4.8 million used in financing activities consisted primarily of $2.9 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.8 million in preferred stock dividends. During the first nine months of fiscal 2021, the $31.8 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $1.1 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.1 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2021, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Other than as described in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2021. Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" 24 Table of Contents ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 20 2 1 . We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees are now working from home. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 25 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. See Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview— Recent Developments” of this report for more discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2022 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 21, 2021. Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Considering the currently unknown extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply to certain of our significant accounting policies. We assessed certain 8 Table of Contents accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to us and the unknown future impacts COVID-19 as of September 3 0 , 202 1 and through the date of this report. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We adopted ASU 2020-06 as of April 1, 2021 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes, and is meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years . We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of April 1, 2021 with no material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready 9 Table of Contents obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 7.3 million and $ 16.1 million, and $ 6.6 million and $ 11.8 million for the first three and six months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $ 30.6 million and $ 60.5 million, and $ 27.8 million and $ 52.4 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 12.2 million and $ 12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively and $ 29.6 million and $ 30.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 0.1 million and $ 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 2.3 million and $ 1.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2021 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. 10 Table of Contents We had $ 3.1 million and $ 3.1 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 , we expensed $ 0.5 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.6 million, respectively. During the comparable periods ending September 30, 2020 , we expensed $ 0.7 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred . 4.

Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income tax expense $ 48 $ 121 $ 241 $ 128 Effective tax rate 4.7 % 2.0 % 7.5 % 2.3 % For the three and six months ended September 30, 2021, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the utilization of net 11 Table of Contents operating losses that were offset by decreases in the valuation allowances in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded and maintain a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50 % due December 31, 2022 . 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. Subsequently, Ameranth filed further pleading amendments and discovery requests with the District Court, which were opposed by the defendants. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgement ruling may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. As of September 30, 2021, we have additional operating leases that have not yet commenced of approximately $ 11.8 million. These operating leases will commence between fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of three years to eleven years . 12 Table of Contents 8. Earnings per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 982 $ 5,867 $ 2,954 $ 5,350 Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs — ( 94 ) — ( 1,031 ) Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) ( 459 ) ( 918 ) ( 658 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 523 $ 5,314 $ 2,036 $ 3,661 Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,451 23,424 24,233 23,415 Dilutive SSARs 892 342 1,005 329 Dilutive unvested restricted shares 66 100 58 105 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,409 23,866 25,296 23,849 Income per share - basic: $ 0.02 $ 0.23 $ 0.08 $ 0.16 Income per share - diluted: $ 0.02 $ 0.22 $ 0.08 $ 0.15 Anti-dilutive SSARs, restricted shares and preferred shares 1,735 2,415 1,735 2,418 Basic income per share is computed as net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 139,332 and 161,042 of restricted shares at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation grants because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (""2020 Plan"") for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The aggregate number of shares that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and performance share grants. The fair value of restricted share and performance share grants is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. We record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition utilizing the graded vesting method. For SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price, share price threshold, remaining contractual term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, suboptimal exercise factor, and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. 13 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Product development $ 1,751 $ 239 $ 3,816 $ 411 Sales and marketing 335 34 666 70 General and administrative 1,256 983 2,481 2,201 Total share-based compensation expense $ 3,342 $ 1,256 $ 6,963 $ 2,682 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2021 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) (in thousands) Outstanding at April 1, 2021 3,068,253 $ 20.90 Exercised ( 791,549 ) 12.47 Forfeited ( 44,736 ) 20.02 Expired ( 246 ) 14.22 Outstanding at September 30, 2021 2,231,722 $ 23.90 5.2 $ 63,509 Exercisable at September 30, 2021 1,234,892 $ 22.85 4.9 $ 36,448 Vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2021 2,231,722 $ 23.90 5.2 $ 63,509 As of September 30, 2021, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested service condition SSARs was $ 8.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.5 years. As of September 30, 2021, there was no unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested market condition SSARs. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2021 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2021 132,198 $ 37.67 Granted 11,249 52.77 Vested ( 216 ) 53.32 Forfeited ( 3,899 ) 27.25 Outstanding at September 30, 2021 139,332 $ 39.14 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of September 30, 2021, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock was $ 2.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.4 years. 14 Table of Contents Subsequent to September 30, 2021, we granted approximately 29,000 shares with a grant date fair value of $ 1.6 million, the vesting of which is service-based, and approximately 45,000 shares with a grant date fair value of $ 1.8 million, the vesting of which is service-based with a market condition. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted 3,403 common shares to our Chief Executive Officer in May 2021 that vested immediately for a total value of $ 0.2 million. 10. Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. We pay dividends in the same period as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. 15 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 24 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. We have taken actions to mitigate the impact on our business. We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may continue to delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. The pandemic could have an ongoing adverse impact on demand for our customers’ products and services, which in turn could negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue, and could also negatively impact the ongoing collection of accounts receivable from our customers. While we have eased certain cost reduction measures, we may take further actions that alter our business operations as the situation continues to evolve. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative modern technology SaaS and on-premise guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia and healthcare.

Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances. • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Second Fiscal Quarter 2022 Compared to Second Fiscal Quarter 2021 Net Revenue and Operating Income The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020: Three months ended September 30, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 7,299 $ 6,559 $ 740 11.3 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 24,027 22,304 1,723 7.7 Professional services 6,566 5,497 1,069 19.4 Total net revenue 37,892 34,360 3,532 10.3 Cost of goods sold: Products 3,660 2,950 710 24.1 Support, maintenance and subscription services 5,019 4,555 464 10.2 Professional services 4,958 3,701 1,257 34.0 Total cost of goods sold 13,637 11,206 2,431 21.7 Gross profit $ 24,255 $ 23,154 $ 1,101 4.8 % Gross profit margin 64.0 % 67.4 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 11,379 $ 8,257 $ 3,122 37.8 % Sales and marketing 3,423 2,350 1,073 45.7 General and administrative 6,523 5,217 1,306 25.0 Depreciation of fixed assets 548 715 (167 ) (23.4 ) Amortization of internal-use software 345 508 (163 ) (32.1 ) Severance and other charges 580 7 573 nm Legal settlements, net 337 50 287 nm Operating income $ 1,120 $ 6,050 $ (4,930 ) 81.5 % Operating income percentage 3.0 % 17.6 % nm - not meaningful 18 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended September 30, 2021 2020 Net revenue: Products 19.3 % 19.1 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 63.4 64.9 Professional services 17.3 16.0 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 9.7 % 8.6 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 13.2 13.3 Professional services 13.1 10.7 Total cost of goods sold 36.0 % 32.6 % Gross profit 64.0 % 67.4 % Operating expenses: Product development 30.0 % 24.0 % Sales and marketing 9.0 6.8 General and administrative 17.2 15.2 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.5 2.2 Amortization of internal-use software 0.9 1.5 Severance and other charges 1.5 0.0 Legal settlements, net 0.9 0.1 Operating income 3.0 % 17.6 % nm - not meaningful Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $3.5 million, or 10.3%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Products revenue increased $0.7 million, or 11.3%, due to higher sales and deliveries as our customers re-open their locations for business. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $1.7 million, or 7.7%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 21.7% during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in subscription revenue is due to the re-opening of customer sites and increased sales and implementations of our newer add-on modules. Professional services revenue increased $1.1 million, or 19.4%, due to higher sales and service activity as our customers re-open their locations for business. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $1.1 million, or 4.8%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and total gross profit margin decreased from 67.4% to 64.0% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit was consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and products gross profit margin decreased from 55.0% to 49.9% due to a higher proportion of third-party products over proprietary software sales. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $1.3 million, or 7.1%, and gross profit margin was consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as certain variable costs increased proportionately with revenue. Professional services gross profit decreased $0.2 million due to delays in certain professional service projects with a decrease in gross profit margin from 32.7% to 24.5% due to an increase in fixed costs as our implementation teams are fully staffed while projects are delayed. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, severance and other charges, increased $5.2 million, or 30.3%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Product development. Product development increased $3.1 million, or 37.8%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to restored base pay and employee benefits as well as higher share-based compensation. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $1.1 million, or 45.7%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to restored base pay and employee benefits, increased share-based compensation, return of some travel costs, and higher advertising and promotional costs due to increased marketing event and trade show activity. 19 Table of Contents General and administrative. General and administrative in creased by $1.3 million , or 25.0 % , in the second quarter of fiscal 202 2 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 20 2 1 due to restored base pay and employee benefits , increased share-based compensation, and higher internal system subscription costs . Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges increased $0.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to one-time payment of certain service provider charges and modified business taxes on share-based compensation related to the exercise of stock-settled appreciation rights granted to our Chief Executive Officer in connection with his initial employment agreement with the Company in December 2016. Legal settlements, net. Legal settlements, net increased $0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to settlement of a lawsuit involving a former employee; no further activity is expected on this matter.

For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the utilization of net operating losses that were offset by decreases in the valuation allowances in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of 20 Table of Contents these deductible differences . The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible .

Total net revenue increased $12.5 million, or 19.4%, during the first half of fiscal 2022 compared to the first half of fiscal 2021. Products revenue increased $4.3 million, or 36.8%, due to higher sales and deliveries as our customers re-open their locations for business. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $4.4 million, or 10.4%, compared to the first half of fiscal 2021 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 26.9% during the first half of fiscal 2022 compared to the first half of fiscal 2021. Professional services revenue increased $3.7 million, or 38.4%, due to higher sales and service activity as our customers re-open their locations for business. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $7.4 million, or 17.8%, for the first half of fiscal 2022 and total gross profit margin decreased from 65.0% to 64.1% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $2.3 million, or 39.3%, compared to the first half of fiscal 2021 and products gross profit margin increased from 49.4% to 50.3% due to an increase in proprietary software revenue and a higher gross profit margin on the mix of third party products. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $3.5 million, or 10.4%, and gross profit margin was consistent with the first half of fiscal 2021 at 79.3% as certain variable costs increased proportionately with revenue. Professional services gross profit increased $1.6 million, or 82.9%, due to the increase in professional service projects as customers continue to re-open their locations. Professional services gross profit margin increased from 20.2% to 26.7% due to improved utilization rates. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, severance and other charges, increased $10.0 million, or 28.6%, during the first half of fiscal 2022 compared with the first half of fiscal 2021. Product development. Product development increased $6.3 million, or 38.4%, in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to restored base pay and employee benefits as well as higher share-based compensation. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $1.5 million, or 30.8%, in the first half of fiscal 2022 compared with the first half of fiscal 2021 due to restored base pay and employee benefits, increased share-based compensation, a return of some travel costs, and higher advertising and promotional costs due to increased marketing event and trade show activity. General and administrative. General and administrative increased by $2.6 million, or 23.7%, in the first half of fiscal 2022 compared with the first half of fiscal 2021 due to restored base pay and employee benefits, increased share-based compensation, and higher internal system subscription costs. 22 Table of Contents Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges decreased $0.4 million in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to layoffs and other employee terminations during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic which did not re-occur during the first half of fiscal 2022. Legal settlements, net. Legal settlements, net increased $0.3 million in the first half of fiscal 2022 compared with the first half of fiscal 2021 due to settlement of a lawsuit involving a former employee; no further activity is expected on this matter. Other (Income) Expenses Six Months Ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Other expense: Interest income $ (35 ) $ (49 ) $ (14 ) (28.6 )% Interest expense 2 3 1 nm Other expense, net — 194 194 nm Total other expense, net $ (33 ) $ 148 $ 181 nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense. Other expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Six Months Ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Income tax expense $ 241 $ 128 $ (113 ) nm Effective tax rate 7.5 % 2.3 % nm - not meaningful For the six months ended September 30, 2021, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the six months ended September 30, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the utilization of net operating losses that were offset by decreases in the valuation allowances in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, payments on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease obligations and preferred stock dividends. At September 30, 2021, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 96% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less, including investments in commercial paper. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. 23 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2021 , and March 31, 20 2 1 , our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $106.4 million as of September 30, 2021 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 11,673 $ 6,642 Investing activities (788 ) (473 ) Financing activities (3,638 ) 32,799 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (38 ) 85 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 7,209 $ 39,053 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $11.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022. The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $11.7 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $8.7 million including loss on disposal of property & equipment, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow (used in) provided by financing activities. During the first six months of fiscal 2022, the $3.6 million used in financing activities consisted of $2.7 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $0.9 million in preferred stock dividends. During the first six months of fiscal 2021, the $32.8 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $1.0 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $0.2 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2021, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Other than as described in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2021. Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA 24 Table of Contents of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 20 2 1 . We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the six months ended September 30, 2021, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees are now working from home. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 25 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. See Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview— Recent Developments” of this report for more discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2022 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 21, 2021. Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Considering the currently unknown extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply to certain of our significant accounting policies. We assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably 8 Table of Contents available to us and the unknown future impacts COVID-19 as of June 3 0 , 202 1 and through the date of this report. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We adopted ASU 2020-06 as of April 1, 2021 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes, and is meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years . We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of April 1, 2021 with no material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. 9 Table of Contents Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 8.8 million and $ 5.2 million, and over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $ 29.9 million and $ 24.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 17.4 million and $ 17.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 2.2 million and $ 1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of June 30, 2021 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 2.9 million and $ 3.2 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we expensed $ 0.7 million and $ 0.6 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized 10 Table of Contents amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.4 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred . 4. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) June 30, 2021 March 31, 2021 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 7,927 $ 8,454 Other taxes payable 1,468 1,796 Accrued legal settlements 118 200 Severance liabilities 182 79 Professional fees 100 97 Other 353 607 Total $ 10,148 $ 11,233 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,135 $ 1,129 Deferred rent and asset retirement obligations 170 170 Employee benefit obligations 2,804 2,639 Other 69 73 Total $ 4,178 $ 4,011 5. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2021 2020 Cash (receipts) for interest, net $ ( 21 ) $ ( 20 ) Cash payments for income taxes, net 192 134 Cash payments for operating leases 969 1,642 Cash payments for finance leases 5 8 Accrued capital expenditures 24 19 6. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020: Three Months Ended June 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 Income tax expense $ 193 $ 8 Effective tax rate 8.9 % ( 1.6 )% For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded and maintain a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. 11 Table of Contents On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50 % due December 31, 2022 . 7. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. Subsequently, Ameranth filed further pleading amendments and discovery requests with the District Court, which were opposed by the defendants. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgement ruling may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 8. Income (Loss) per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing income (loss) per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 1,972 $ ( 517 ) Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs — ( 937 ) Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) ( 199 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 1,513 $ ( 1,653 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 24,014 23,405 Dilutive SSARs 1,115 — Dilutive unvested restricted shares 49 — Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 25,178 23,405 Income (loss) per share - basic: $ 0.06 $ ( 0.07 ) Income (loss) per share - diluted: $ 0.06 $ ( 0.07 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 4,740 3,560 Basic income (loss) per share is computed as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 138,736 and 194,587 of 12 Table of Contents restricted shares at June 3 0 , 20 2 1 and 20 20 , respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income ( loss ) per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation grants because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 9. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (""2020 Plan"") for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The aggregate number of shares that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3.1 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and performance share grants. The fair value of restricted share and performance share grants is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. We record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition utilizing the graded vesting method. For SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price, share price threshold, remaining contractual term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, suboptimal exercise factor, and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2021 2020 Product development $ 2,065 $ 172 Sales and marketing 331 36 General and administrative 1,225 1,218 Total share-based compensation expense $ 3,621 $ 1,426 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. 13 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2021 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) (in thousands) Outstanding at April 1, 2021 3,068,253 $ 20.90 Exercised ( 714,712 ) 11.78 Forfeited ( 15,818 ) 20.02 Expired ( 162 ) 14.22 Outstanding at June 30, 2021 2,337,561 $ 23.69 5.4 $ 77,558 Exercisable at June 30, 2021 1,255,211 $ 21.99 5.2 $ 43,788 Vested and expected to vest at June 30, 2021 2,337,561 $ 23.69 5.4 $ 77,558 As of June 30, 2021, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested service condition SSARs was $ 12.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.7 years. As of June 30, 2021, there was no unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested market condition SSARs. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2021 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2021 132,198 $ 37.67 Granted 8,610 52.23 Forfeited ( 2,072 ) 24.39 Outstanding at June 30, 2021 138,736 $ 38.77 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of June 30, 2021, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock was $ 3.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.6 years. Performance Shares Upon approval of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, after achieving the performance conditions associated with our annual bonus plan, we granted 3,403 common shares to our Chief Executive Officer during the quarter that vested immediately for a total value of $ 0.2 million. 10. Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 22 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our business since that time. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue impacting our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on various factors, including the ongoing or recurring impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Because an increasing portion of our business is based on a subscription model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. We have taken actions to mitigate the impact on our business. We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may continue to delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. The pandemic could have an ongoing adverse impact on demand for our customers’ products and services, which in turn could continue to negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue, and could also negatively impact the ongoing collection of accounts receivable from our customers. While we have eased certain cost reduction measures recently, we may take further actions that alter our business operations as the situation continues to evolve. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native SaaS and on-premise guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia and healthcare. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive software solutions in the hospitality industry, including point-of-sale (POS), property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, payments, and related applications, to manage the entire guest journey. Agilysys is also known for its world class customer-centric service. During recent years, Agilysys has made major investments in R&D and has successfully modernized virtually all its longstanding trusted software solutions. Some of the largest hospitality companies around the world use Agilysys solutions to help improve guest loyalty, drive revenue growth and increase operational efficiencies. 15 Table of Contents The Company has just one reportable segment serving the global hospitality industry. Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, G eorgia . Our top priority is increasing shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to existing software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically. Our strategic plan specifically focuses on: • Putting the customer first • Focusing on product innovation and development • Improving our liquidity • Increasing organizational efficiency and teamwork • Developing our employees and leaders • Growing revenue by improving the breadth and depth of our product set across both point-of-sale and property management applications • Growing revenue through international expansion The primary objective of our ongoing strategic planning process is to create shareholder value by capitalizing on growth opportunities, turning profitable and strengthening our competitive position within the specific technology solutions and end markets we serve. Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances. • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations First Fiscal Quarter 2022 Compared to First Fiscal Quarter 2021 Net Revenue and Operating Income (Loss) The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020: Three months ended June 30, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 8,844 $ 5,239 $ 3,605 68.8 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 23,207 20,497 2,710 13.2 Professional services 6,674 4,071 2,603 63.9 Total net revenue 38,725 29,807 8,918 29.9 Cost of goods sold: Products 4,360 3,015 1,345 44.6 Support, maintenance and subscription services 4,744 4,306 438 10.2 Professional services 4,754 3,936 818 20.8 Total cost of goods sold 13,858 11,257 2,601 23.1 Gross profit $ 24,867 $ 18,550 $ 6,317 34.1 % Gross profit margin 64.2 % 62.2 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 11,485 $ 8,266 $ 3,219 38.9 % Sales and marketing 3,052 2,601 451 17.3 General and administrative 7,003 5,719 1,284 22.5 Depreciation of fixed assets 566 723 (157 ) (21.7 ) Amortization of internal-use software 465 461 4 0.9 Severance and other charges 225 1,203 (978 ) nm Legal settlements, net 30 - 30 nm Operating income (loss) $ 2,041 $ (423 ) $ 2,464 582.5 % Operating income (loss) percentage 5.3 % (1.4 )% nm - not meaningful 17 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended June 30, 2021 2020 Net revenue: Products 22.8 % 17.6 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 59.9 68.8 Professional services 17.3 13.6 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 11.3 % 10.1 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 12.3 14.4 Professional services 12.2 13.3 Total cost of goods sold 35.8 % 37.8 % Gross profit 64.2 % 62.2 % Operating expenses: Product development 29.7 % 27.7 % Sales and marketing 7.9 8.7 General and administrative 18.1 19.2 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.5 2.5 Amortization of internal-use software 1.2 1.5 Severance and other charges 0.6 4.0 Legal settlements, net 0.1 nm Operating income (loss) 5.3 % (1.4 )% nm - not meaningful Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $8.9 million, or 29.9%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Products revenue increased $3.6 million, or 68.8%, due to higher sales and deliveries as our customers re-open their locations for business. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $2.7 million, or 13.2%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue. The increase in subscription revenue is due to the re-opening of customer sites and increased sales and implementations of our newer add-on modules. Professional services revenue increased $2.6 million, or 63.9%, due to higher sales and service activity as our customers re-open their locations for business. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $6.3 million, or 34.1%, for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and total gross profit margin increased from 62.2% to 64.2% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $2.3 million, or 101.6%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and products gross profit margin increased from 42.5% to 50.7% due to a higher proportion of proprietary software sales over third party products. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.3 million and gross profit margin increased 57 basis points to 79.6% due to increased revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit increased $1.8 million due to the increase in professional service projects as customers to re-open their locations. Professional services gross profit margin increased from 3.3% to 28.8% due to improved utilization rates. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, severance and other charges, increased $4.8 million, or 27.0%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Product development. Product development increased $3.2 million, or 38.9%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 due to restored base pay and employee benefits as well as higher cash-based incentive pay and share-based compensation. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $0.5 million, or 17.3%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to restored base pay and employee benefits as well as increased commission expense due to higher sales levels and increased share-based compensation. 18 Table of Contents General and administrative. General and administrative in creased by $1.3 million , or 22.5 % , in the first quarter of fiscal 202 2 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 20 2 1 due to restored base pay and employee benefits as well as higher cash-based incentive pay and internal system subscription costs . Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges decreased $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to significant layoffs and other employee terminations during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other (Income) Expenses Three Months Ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Other (income) expense: Interest income $ (22 ) $ (21 ) $ 1 4.8 % Interest expense 1 1 0 nm Other (income) expense, net (103 ) 106 209 nm Total other (income) expense, net $ (124 ) $ 86 $ 210 nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned through interest-bearing bank accounts and on cash equivalents including short-term investments in commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other (income) expense. Other (income) expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three Months Ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 $ % Income tax expense $ 193 $ 8 $ (185 ) nm Effective tax rate 8.9 % (1.6 )% nm - not meaningful For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, payments on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease obligations and preferred stock dividends. At June 30, 2021, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 95% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. As of June 30, 2021, and March 31, 2021, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $103.9 million as of June 30, 2021 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 7,995 $ (4,929 ) Investing activities (276 ) (245 ) Financing activities (2,994 ) 33,123 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 6 2 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,731 $ 27,951 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $8.0 million in the first three months of fiscal 2022. The provision of cash was due to cash-based earnings of $6.6 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $4.7 million including loss on disposal of property & equipment, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, and an increase of $1.4 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow (used in) provided by financing activities. During the first three months of fiscal 2022, the $3.0 million used in financing activities consisted of $2.1 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $0.9 million in preferred stock dividends. During the first three months of fiscal 2021, the $33.1 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.1 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $0.9 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2021, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2021. Other than as described in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2021. 20 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2021, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees are now working from home. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 21 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

COVID-19 Pandemic On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak has reached all geographic regions in which we do business, and government authorities around the world have implemented extensive measures attempting to contain the spread and mitigate the effects of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, closures of non-essential businesses, and social distancing requirements. The global spread of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response have negatively impacted us, our customers, our suppliers and the many communities in which we do business. The overall extent and duration of economic and business disruption is not currently known. In response to these challenges, we quickly adjusted our business policies and practices for employees to work from home and have taken other measures to continue our operations with safety as our top priority. We continuously monitor and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including recommendations and orders from government and public health authorities. We are working to help our customers maintain their operations during this difficult time while managing our teams to be prepared for continuously changing demand for our products and services. See Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview— Recent Developments” of this report for a more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2021 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 22, 2020. 8 Table of Contents Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Considering the currently unknown extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply to certain of our significant accounting policies. We assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to us and the unknown future impacts COVID-19 as of December 31, 2020 and through the date of this report. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We describe our accounting policy for Series A convertible preferred stock further below. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes, and is meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years . We are currently reviewing this standard but do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15 , Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. We adopted ASU 2018-15 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. We adopted ASU 2018-13 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires a goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. We adopted ASU 2017-04 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) – Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This new standard requires entities to measure expected credit losses for certain financial assets held at the 9 Table of Contents reporting date using a current expected credit loss model, which is based on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company’s financial instruments within the scope of this guidance primarily includes accounts receivable and contract assets. We adopted ASU 2016-13 as of April 1, 2020 under the modified retrospective approach. As a result, comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards applicable for those periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. 10 Table of Contents We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 7.6 million and $ 19.4 million, and $ 12.1 million and $ 34.9 million for the first three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $ 29.1 million and $ 81.4 million, and $ 29.9 million and $ 86.2 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 9.1 million and $ 8.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 38.1 million and $ 34.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 0.1 million and $ 0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 1.8 million and $ 2.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2020 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.0 million and $ 3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020, we expensed $ 0.7 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively. During the comparable periods ending December 31, 2019, we expensed $ 1.3 million and $ 3.5 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 1.0 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 11 Table of Contents 4. Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs: December 31 and March 31, 2020 Gross Net carrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying (In thousands) amount amortization Impairment amount Amortized intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 10,775 $ ( 10,775 ) $ — $ — Non-competition agreements 2,700 ( 2,700 ) — — Developed technology 10,398 ( 10,398 ) — — Trade names 230 ( 230 ) — — Patented technology 80 ( 80 ) — — 24,183 ( 24,183 ) — — Trade names 8,400 N/A — 8,400 Total intangible assets $ 32,583 $ ( 24,183 ) $ — $ 8,400 (In thousands) Software development costs $ 67,541 $ ( 45,535 ) $ ( 22,006 ) $ — As of March 31, 2020, management determined the net realizable value of the remaining capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $ 22.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions that made it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the related rGuest solutions. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. The amount of impairment recognized during the year ended March 31, 2020 reduced the carrying value of capitalized software development costs to zero with no remaining amortization expense to be recognized in future periods. Amortization expense for software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $ 3.1 million and $ 9.4 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019. These charges are included as costs of goods sold - products in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 5. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) December 31, 2020 March 31, 2020 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 5,053 $ 6,945 Payroll taxes deferred under CARES Act 911 — Other taxes payable 2,084 1,649 Accrued legal settlements 50 — Severance liabilities 329 32 Professional fees 55 50 Other 371 357 Total $ 8,853 $ 9,033 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,123 $ 1,103 Asset retirement obligations 170 170 Payroll taxes deferred under CARES Act 911 — Employee benefit obligations 1,466 511 Other 70 76 Total $ 3,740 $ 1,860 12 Table of Contents 6. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information A dditional information related to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Cash (receipts) for interest, net $ ( 63 ) $ ( 259 ) Cash payments for income taxes, net 195 252 Cash payments for operating leases 4,039 3,560 Cash payments for finance leases 21 27 Accrued capital expenditures 64 48 7. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Income tax expense $ 182 $ 95 $ 311 $ 161 Effective tax rate ( 9.6 )% ( 3.8 )% 8.7 % ( 2.3 )% For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses that were offset by increased valuation allowance in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the nine months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the utilization of net operating losses that were offset by decreased valuation allowance in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions that were offset by increased valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded and maintain a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50 % due December 31, 2022 . 8. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 13 Table of Contents 2020. Subsequently, Ameranth filed further pleading amendments and discovery requests with the District Court, which were opposed by the defendants. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgement ruling may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 9. Income (Loss) per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing income (loss) per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ ( 2,070 ) $ ( 2,582 ) $ 3,280 $ ( 7,075 ) Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs — — ( 1,031 ) — Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) — ( 1,117 ) — Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ ( 2,529 ) $ ( 2,582 ) $ 1,132 $ ( 7,075 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 23,429 23,240 23,419 23,230 Dilutive SSARs — — 377 — Dilutive unvested restricted shares — — 107 — Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 23,429 23,240 23,903 23,230 Income (loss) per share - basic: $ ( 0.11 ) $ ( 0.11 ) $ 0.05 $ ( 0.30 ) Income (loss) per share - diluted: $ ( 0.11 ) $ ( 0.11 ) $ 0.05 $ ( 0.30 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 3,389 1,469 2,692 1,414 Basic income (loss) per share is computed as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 204,009 and 416,960 of restricted shares at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income (loss) per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation grants because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 10. Share-based Compensation We may grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares under our shareholder-approved 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (""2020 Plan"") for up to 2.25 million common shares, plus 868,864 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2016 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The aggregate number of shares that may be granted under the 2020 Plan is 3,118,864 . We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and SSAR exercises or restricted share and performance share grants. The fair value of restricted share and performance share grants is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. For stock option and SSAR grants subject to a service condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price and 14 Table of Contents assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility, and expected term as estimated using the simplified method. We record compensation expense for restricted shares and SSAR grants subject to a service condition utilizing the graded vesting method. For SSAR grants subject to a market condition, we estimate the fair value on the grant date through a lattice option pricing model that utilizes a Monte Carlo analysis with inputs including the closing market price at grant date, exercise price, share price threshold, remaining contractual term and assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, suboptimal exercise factor, and expected volatility of our common shares based on historical volatility. We record compensation expense for SSAR grants subject to a market condition over the derived service period, which is an output of the lattice option pricing model. The grant date is defined as the date all necessary approvals are obtained. All grants during the nine months ended December 31, 2020 were made under the 2020 Plan, which was approved by our shareholders on November 19, 2020. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved substantially all grants under the 2020 Plan for the nine months ended December 31, 2020 on June 2, 2020. The closing market price of our common stock was $ 39.65 and $ 20.02 on November 19, 2020 and June 2, 2020, respectively. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance grants included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Product development $ 3,362 $ 639 $ 3,773 $ 1,579 Sales and marketing 666 104 735 217 General and administrative 2,602 586 4,804 1,360 Total share-based compensation expense $ 6,630 $ 1,329 $ 9,312 $ 3,156 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference between the price of our common shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2020 for SSARs awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 1,644,888 $ 21.07 Granted 2,234,858 20.02 Exercised ( 80,255 ) 11.93 Forfeited ( 68,201 ) 19.79 Expired ( 2,118 ) 14.22 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 3,729,172 $ 20.66 5.5 $ 66,069 Exercisable at December 31, 2020 995,713 $ 14.73 3.5 $ 23,544 Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2020 3,729,172 $ 20.66 5.5 $ 66,069 As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested service condition SSARs was $ 21.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.2 years. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested market condition SSARs was $ 21.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.0 years. If the market condition for any SSARs is met prior to the end of their expected vesting period, all remaining unrecognized compensation expense for those SSARs will be recognized at that time. 15 Table of Contents Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2020 for restricted shares awarded under the 2020 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 178,462 $ 19.89 Granted 56,527 39.63 Forfeited ( 30,980 ) 20.65 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 204,009 $ 25.24 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock was $ 2.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.3 years. Performance Shares We awarded certain restricted shares to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is performance based. The number of shares that vested were based on relative attainment of a performance metric and any unvested shares were forfeited upon settlement of the bonus. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2020 for the performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: Number of Shares Outstanding at April 1, 2020 30,120 Granted — Vested ( 6,714 ) Forfeited ( 23,406 ) Outstanding at December 31, 2020 — 11. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Accounting Policy We classify convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption clauses that are at the election of the Holders. We increase the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value (described below) for all undeclared dividends using the interest method. The Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights, preferences and restrictions (the Certificate of Amendment included as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 26, 2020, defines all terms not otherwise defined below): 16 Table of Contents Voting The Holders will be entitled to one vote for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock upon all matters presented to the common shareholders of the Company , and except as otherwise provided by the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company or required by law, the Holders and common shareholders will vote together as one class on all matters. Additionally, certain matters specific to the Convertible Preferred Stock will require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. Liquidation Preference Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the “Liquidation Preference”) and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Redemption On and after the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, the Company will have the right, and the Holders will have the right to require the Company, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the then-outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference. Conversion Each Holder will have the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as described in the Certificate of Amendment). Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023 , the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is at least 150 % of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert. Dividends The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. The Holders are not entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis; however, certain anti-dilution adjustments to the Convertible Preferred Stock may be made in the event of such dividends. The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Change in Control Events Upon certain change of control events involving the Company, the Company has the right, and each Holder has the right, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its then-outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for cash consideration equal to (i) 150% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring prior to the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, (ii) 125% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the third anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and (iii) 100% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued . Standstill Restrictions The Purchaser and its affiliates are subject to certain customary standstill provisions that restrict them from, among other actions, acquiring additional securities of the Company if such acquisition would result in the Purchaser beneficially owning in excess of 25 % of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company until the later of the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred 17 Table of Contents Stock is initially issued and the date on which the Purchaser no longer has record or beneficial ownership of common stock and Convertible Preferred Stock that constitute at least 10 % of the outstanding common stock. 18 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 29 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak has reached all geographic regions in which we do business, and government authorities around the world have implemented extensive measures attempting to contain the spread and mitigate the effects of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, closures of non-essential businesses, and social distancing requirements. The global spread of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response have negatively impacted us, our customers, our suppliers and the many communities in which we do business. The overall extent and duration of economic and business disruption is not currently known. In response to these challenges, we quickly adjusted our business policies and practices for employees to work from home and have taken other measures to continue our operations with safety as our top priority. We continuously monitor and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including recommendations and orders from government and public health authorities. We are working to help our customers maintain their operations during this difficult time while managing our teams to be prepared for continuously changing demand for our products and services. During the first nine months of our fiscal 2021, revenue was negatively impacted by delays and reduced spending attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers’ operational priorities and as a result of various one-time recurring revenue related and other concessions we have given to customers to help them during this time of need. Due to the pandemic, we have seen a reduction or delay in customer contracts, and we have seen a significant reduction in face-to-face meetings with existing or prospective customers, in-person demonstrations of our solutions, and have been unable to host or attend in-person trade shows and conferences. Limitations on access to the facilities of our customers have also impacted our ability to deliver some of our products, complete certain implementations, and provide in-person consulting and training services, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue. We continued to experience high recurring revenue renewal rates during the first nine months of the fiscal year. We also have an expanded product base that includes new products which allow for contactless capabilities and other features which help promote social distancing and guest safety. Despite our strong first nine months of recurring renewal rates and new solution offerings, we cannot predict how the pandemic will impact our results in the short-term future, including to the extent that customers delay or miss payments, customers defer, reduce, or refrain from placing orders or renewing subscriptions or maintenance arrangements, or travel restrictions and site access restrictions remain necessary. We likewise cannot predict our results in the long-term future as our customers adapt to the lingering and perhaps more permanent impact of the pandemic on the hospitality industry. 19 Table of Contents We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and mostly remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may continue to delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. In addition, during the first nine months of our fiscal 2021, we reduced discretionary costs, implemented a hiring freeze on non-essential positions and reduced payroll and related costs through layoffs, employee furloughs, employee retirement benefit limitations, and temporary salary decreases for executive team members and certain other employees of the Company. Such actions may have an adverse impact on us, particularly those actions that remain in place for an extended period as we continue to manage through the uncertainties around the timing and extent of the pandemic’s impact . We may take further actions or retract previous actions that alter our business operations as the situation continues to evolve. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted and signed into U.S. law to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses facing economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We deferred $1.8 million in employer payroll tax payments under the CARES Act as of December 31, 2020. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2020. MAK Capital Investment In May 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell to MAK Capital One, LLC (“MAK Capital”) $35 million of convertible preferred stock carrying a 5.25% dividend that will be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 1,735,457 preferred shares which added $35 million in preferred stock to the Company’s balance sheet and increased our cash balance by the $35 million investment less closing costs of $1.0 million. The 5.25% dividends will accumulate and increase the liquidation preference of the preferred stock for any undeclared amounts. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative cloud-native subscription and on-premise guest-centric technology solutions for gaming, hotels, resorts and cruise, corporate foodservice management, restaurants, universities, stadia, airport foodservice and healthcare.

In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances. • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products.

Total net revenue decreased $5.3 million, or 12.7%, during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 37.3%, due to lower sales due to delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $1.9 million, or 9.0%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue that increased 18.1% during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Professional services revenue decreased $2.7 million, or 30.0%, due to lower sales due to delayed customer purchasing decisions as the timing of the hospitality recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $3.1 million, or 14.9%, for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 50.2% to 66.0% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category and the absence of software development cost amortization during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Products gross profit increased $1.5 million, or 58.4%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and products gross profit margin increased from 20.5% to 51.8% due to the absence of software development cost amortization during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and a higher proportion of proprietary software sales over third party products. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.1 million and gross profit margin increased 272 basis points to 79.6%. The margin increase is the result of increased revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit decreased $0.4 million due to the delay in professional service projects as customers continued to work towards re-opening their locations. Gross profit margin increased from 27.6% to 33.2% due to improved utilization rates and a slightly larger decrease in the percentage of professional services costs compared to professional services revenue as a result of employee furloughs and layoffs, lower incentive pay and employee benefits. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, severance and other charges, increased $0.7 million, or 3.0%, during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Product development. Product development increased $1.1 million, or 9.7%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 due to lower cash-based incentive pay and employee benefits offset by higher share-based compensation. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $1.6 million, or 32.4%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2020 due to layoffs, temporary reductions in employee benefits, and reduced commission expense due to lower sales levels. The decrease also includes the impact of significantly reduced travel, the absence of in-person trade shows and conference activity, and the ability to conduct more business remotely. 22 Table of Contents General and administrative. General and administrative in creased by $1.4 million , or 23.4 % , in the third quarter of fiscal 202 1 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 20 20 due to higher share-based compensation offsetting lower cash-based incentive pay and employee benefits. Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges increased $1.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 due to layoffs and other employee terminations.

Interest income consists of interest earned through interest-bearing bank accounts and on cash equivalents including short-term investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense. Other expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three Months Ended December 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 $ % Income tax expense $ 182 $ 95 $ (87 ) nm Effective tax rate (9.6 )% (3.8 )% nm - not meaningful For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses that were offset by increased valuation allowance in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions that were offset by increased valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 23 Table of Contents Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences . The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible .

Total net revenue decreased $20.3 million, or 16.7%, during the first nine months of fiscal 2021 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $15.5 million, or 44.4%, due to lower sales combined with delayed deliveries resulting from customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $4.3 million, or 7.0%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2020 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue that increased 17.0% during the first nine months of fiscal 2021 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2020. The growth rate in our support, maintenance and subscription services is significantly lower than we have reported in recent periods due to one-time COVID-19 related financial relief we provided to certain customers primarily during the first half of fiscal 2021 to help them as they dealt with temporary site closures. Professional services revenue decreased $9.1 million, or 36.4%, due to lower sales combined with delayed installations and integration of our software solutions resulting from travel and customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $4.6 million, or 7.5%, for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 50.6% to 65.3% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category and the absence of software development cost amortization.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, payments on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease obligations and preferred stock dividends. At December 31, 2020, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 96% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. The MAK Capital investment increased our cash balance by $34.0 million after closing costs of $1.0 million. As described above under Recent Developments and further in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the transaction resulted in the issuance of 1,735,457 preferred shares with an annual dividend rate of 5.25%. Our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and services, including the impact of changes in customer buying behavior due to circumstances over which we have no control, including, but not limited to, the effects of the 26 Table of Contents COVID-19 pandemic. If we require additional fund ing , for operating needs, a business acquisition or otherwise, we may need access to more capital , which could involve borrowings under a credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, and March 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $92.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 15,084 $ 5,273 Investing activities (1,078 ) (3,035 ) Financing activities 31,765 (1,071 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 184 (33 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 45,955 $ 1,134 Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $15.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. The provision of cash was due primarily to the addition of $12.5 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, to our operating income of $3.3 million offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities. During the first nine months of fiscal 2021, the $31.8 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $1.1 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $1.1 million in preferred stock dividends. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2020, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Other than as described in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2020. Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences 27 Table of Contents or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 20 20 . We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2020, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees are now working from home. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 28 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

COVID-19 Pandemic On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak has reached all geographic regions in which we do business, and government authorities around the world have implemented extensive measures attempting to contain the spread and mitigate the effects of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, closures of non-essential businesses, and social distancing requirements. The global spread of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response have negatively impacted us, our customers, our suppliers and the many communities in which we do business. The overall extent and duration of economic and business disruption is not currently known. In response to these challenges, we quickly adjusted our business policies and practices for employees to work from home and have taken other measures to continue our operations with safety as our priority. We continuously monitor and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including recommendations and orders from government and public health authorities. We are working to help our customers maintain their operations during this difficult time while managing our teams to be prepared for continuously changing demand for our products and services. See Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview— Recent Developments” of this report for a more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2021 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2020, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 22, 2020. 8 Table of Contents Use of estimates Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Considering the currently unknown extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply to certain of our significant accounting policies. We assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to us and the unknown future impacts COVID-19 as of September 30, 2020 and through the date of this report. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We describe our accounting policy for Series A convertible preferred stock further below. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing the separation model, a convertible debt instrument will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. This new standard also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for contracts to qualify for equity classification and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculations by requiring that an entity use the if-converted method and that the effect of potential share settlement be included in diluted earnings per share calculations. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which affects general principles within Topic 740, Income Taxes, and is meant to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years . We are currently reviewing this standard but do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15 , Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. We adopted ASU 2018-15 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. We adopted ASU 2018-13 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires a goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. We adopted ASU 2017-04 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) – Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This new standard requires entities to measure expected credit losses for certain financial assets held at the reporting date using a current expected credit loss model, which is based on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and 9 Table of Contents reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company’s financial instruments within the scope of this guidance primarily includes accounts receivable and contract assets. We adopted ASU 2016-13 as of April 1, 2020 under the modified retrospective approach. As a result, comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards applicable for those periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, given our limited historical write-off activity. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. 10 Table of Contents We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 6.6 million and $ 11.8 million, and $ 11.9 million and $ 22.7 million for the first three and six months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $ 27.8 million and $ 52.4 million, and $ 28.8 million and $ 56.4 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 12.1 million and $ 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 30.5 million and $ 26.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 0.2 million and $ 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 1.7 million and $ 2.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2020 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.1 million and $ 3.4 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2020, we expensed $ 0.7 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively. During the comparable periods ending September 30, 2019, we expensed $ 1.2 million and $ 2.2 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 11 Table of Contents 4. Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs: September 30 and March 31, 2020 Gross Net carrying Accumulated Accumulated carrying (In thousands) amount amortization Impairment amount Amortized intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 10,775 $ ( 10,775 ) $ — $ — Non-competition agreements 2,700 ( 2,700 ) — — Developed technology 10,398 ( 10,398 ) — — Trade names 230 ( 230 ) — — Patented technology 80 ( 80 ) — — 24,183 ( 24,183 ) — — Trade names 8,400 N/A — 8,400 Total intangible assets $ 32,583 $ ( 24,183 ) $ — $ 8,400 (In thousands) Software development costs $ 67,541 $ ( 45,535 ) $ ( 22,006 ) $ — As of March 31, 2020, management determined the net realizable value of the remaining capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $ 22.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions that made it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the related rGuest solutions. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. The amount of impairment recognized during the year ended March 31, 2020 reduced the carry value of capitalized software development costs to zero with no remaining amortization expense to be recognized in future periods. Amortization expense for software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $ 3.1 million and $ 6.3 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019. These charges are included as costs of goods sold - products in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 5. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: September 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 4,793 $ 6,945 Other taxes payable 1,835 1,649 Accrued legal settlements 50 — Severance liabilities 100 32 Professional fees 93 50 Other 314 357 Total $ 7,185 $ 9,033 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,116 $ 1,103 Asset retirement obligations 170 170 Payroll taxes deferred under CARES Act 1,287 — Employee benefit obligations 1,081 511 Other 74 76 Total $ 3,728 $ 1,860 12 Table of Contents 6. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information A dditional information related to the consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Cash (receipts) for interest, net $ ( 46 ) $ ( 191 ) Cash payments for income taxes, net 167 247 Cash payments for operating leases 3,002 2,210 Cash payments for finance leases 14 18 Accrued capital expenditures 12 125 7. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Income tax expense $ 121 $ 41 $ 128 $ 67 Effective tax rate 2.0 % ( 1.4 )% 2.3 % ( 1.5 )% For the three and six months ended September 30, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the utilization of net operating losses that were offset by decreases in the valuation allowances in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded and maintain a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act provides, among other provisions, for the deferral of the employer-paid portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50 % of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50 % due December 31, 2022 . 8. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. Ameranth’s writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied in October 2020. Subsequently, Ameranth filed further pleading amendments and discovery requests with the District Court, which were opposed by the defendants. 13 Table of Contents We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgement ruling may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 9. Income (Loss) per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing income (loss) per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 5,867 $ ( 2,918 ) $ 5,350 $ ( 4,493 ) Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs ( 94 ) — ( 1,031 ) — Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 459 ) — ( 658 ) — Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 5,314 $ ( 2,918 ) $ 3,661 $ ( 4,493 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 23,424 23,238 23,415 23,225 Dilutive SSARs 342 — 329 — Dilutive unvested restricted shares 100 — 105 — Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 23,866 23,238 23,849 23,225 Income (loss) per share - basic: $ 0.23 $ ( 0.13 ) $ 0.16 $ ( 0.19 ) Income (loss) per share - diluted: $ 0.22 $ ( 0.13 ) $ 0.15 $ ( 0.19 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 2,415 1,494 2,418 1,386 Basic income (loss) per share is computed as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 161,042 and 418,854 of restricted shares at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income (loss) per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted income (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares, unvested performance shares, and preferred shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. 10. Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") for up to 2.0 million common shares, plus 957,575 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (""2011 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is 1.25 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. We record compensation expense related to stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and SSARs awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. During fiscal year 2020, we issued 125,000 SSAR awards which are subject to a market condition. The fair value of these awards is estimated using the Lattice 14 Table of Contents option pricing model which utilizes a binary tree and includes multiple assumptions which include volatility and life of the award to determine an appropriate fair value based on the award grant date. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Product development $ 239 $ 672 $ 411 $ 940 Sales and marketing 34 51 70 113 General and administrative 983 622 2,201 774 Total share-based compensation expense $ 1,256 $ 1,345 $ 2,682 $ 1,827 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2020 for SSARs awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 1,644,888 $ 21.07 Exercised ( 63,872 ) 11.64 Forfeited ( 11,430 ) 18.65 Expired ( 1,522 ) 14.22 Outstanding at September 30, 2020 1,568,064 $ 21.48 4.4 $ 11,674 Exercisable at September 30, 2020 973,110 $ 13.82 3.7 $ 11,214 Vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2020 1,568,064 $ 21.48 4.4 $ 11,674 As of September 30, 2020, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested SSARs was $ 3.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.0 years. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2020 for restricted shares awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 178,462 $ 19.89 Forfeited ( 17,420 ) 19.03 Outstanding at September 30, 2020 161,042 $ 19.98 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of September 30, 2020, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock was $ 1.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.4 years. 15 Table of Contents Performance Shares We awarded certain restricted shares to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is performance based. The number of shares that vested were based on relative attainment of a performance metric and any unvested shares were forfeited upon settlement of the bonus. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2020 for the performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Shares Outstanding at April 1, 2020 30,120 Granted — Vested ( 6,714 ) Forfeited ( 23,406 ) Outstanding at September 30, 2020 — 11. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 1.0 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Accounting Policy We classify convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption clauses that are at the election of the Holders. We increase the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value (described below) for all undeclared dividends using the interest method. The Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights, preferences and restrictions (the Certificate of Amendment included as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 26, 2020, defines all terms not otherwise defined below): Voting The Holders will be entitled to one vote for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock upon all matters presented to the common shareholders of the Company , and except as otherwise provided by the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company or required by law, the Holders and common shareholders will vote together as one class on all matters. Additionally, certain matters specific to the Convertible Preferred Stock will require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. Liquidation Preference Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the “Liquidation Preference”) and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. 16 Table of Contents Redemption On and after the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, the Company will have the right, and the Holders will have the right to require the Company, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the then-outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference. Conversion Each Holder will have the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as described in the Certificate of Amendment). Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023 , the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is at least 150 % of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert. Dividends The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. The Holders are not entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis; however, certain anti-dilution adjustments to the Convertible Preferred Stock may be made in the event of such dividends. The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Change in Control Events Upon certain change of control events involving the Company, the Company has the right, and each Holder has the right, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its then-outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for cash consideration equal to (i) 150% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring prior to the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, (ii) 125% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the third anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and (iii) 100% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued . Standstill Restrictions The Purchaser and its affiliates are subject to certain customary standstill provisions that restrict them from, among other actions, acquiring additional securities of the Company if such acquisition would result in the Purchaser beneficially owning in excess of 25 % of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company until the later of the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and the date on which the Purchaser no longer has record or beneficial ownership of common stock and Convertible Preferred Stock that constitute at least 10 % of the outstanding common stock. 17 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 29 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak has reached all geographic regions in which we do business, and government authorities around the world have implemented extensive measures attempting to contain the spread and mitigate the effects of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, closures of non-essential businesses, and social distancing requirements. The global spread of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response have negatively impacted us, our customers, our suppliers and the many communities in which we do business. The overall extent and duration of economic and business disruption is not currently known. In response to these challenges, we quickly adjusted our business policies and practices for employees to work from home and have taken other measures to continue our operations with safety as our priority. We continuously monitor and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including recommendations and orders from government and public health authorities. We are working to help our customers maintain their operations during this difficult time while managing our teams to be prepared for continuously changing demand for our products and services. During the first half of our fiscal 2021, revenue was negatively impacted by delays and reduced spending attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers’ operational priorities and as a result of various one-time recurring revenue related and other concessions we have given to customers to help them during this time of need. Due to the pandemic, we have seen a reduction or delay in customer contracts, and we have been unable to conduct face-to-face meetings with existing or prospective customers, present in-person demonstrations of our solutions, or host or attend in-person trade shows and conferences. Limitations on access to the facilities of our customers have also impacted our ability to deliver some of our products, complete certain implementations, and provide in-person consulting and training services, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue. We continued to experience high recurring revenue renewal rates during the first half of the fiscal year. We also have an expanded product base that includes new products which allow for contactless capabilities and other features which help promote social distancing and guest safety. Despite our strong first half recurring renewal rates and new solution offerings, we cannot predict how the pandemic will impact our results in future periods, including to the extent that customers delay or miss payments, customers defer, reduce, or refrain from placing orders or renewing subscriptions or maintenance arrangements, or travel restrictions and site access restrictions remain necessary. We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may continue to delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. In addition, during the first half of our fiscal 2021, we reduced discretionary costs, implemented a hiring freeze on non-essential positions and reduced payroll and related 18 Table of Contents costs through layoffs, employee furloughs, employee retirement benefit limitations, and salary decreases for executive team members and certain other employees of the Company. Such actions may have an adverse impact on us, particularly those actions that remain in place for an extended period. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as the situation evolves. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted and signed into U.S. law to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses facing economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We plan to continue deferring the timing of employer payroll tax payments as permitted by the CARES Act. We deferred $1.3 million in employer payroll tax payments under the CARES Act as of September 30, 2020. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations as of and for the six months ended September 30, 2020. MAK Capital Investment In May 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell to MAK Capital One, LLC (“MAK Capital”) $35 million of convertible preferred stock carrying a 5.25% dividend that will be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 1,735,457 preferred shares which added $35 million in preferred stock to the Company’s balance sheet and increased our cash balance by the $35 million investment less closing costs of $1.0 million. The 5.25% dividends will accumulate and increase the liquidation preference of the preferred stock for any undeclared amounts.

In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances. • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products.

Total net revenue decreased $6.4 million, or 15.6%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $5.3 million, or 44.8%, due to lower sales combined with delayed deliveries resulting from customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $2.0 million, or 9.7%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 23.9% during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Professional services revenue decreased $3.0 million, or 35.5%, due to lower sales combined with delayed installations and integration of our software solutions resulting from travel and customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $2.9 million, or 14.5%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 49.6% to 67.4% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $1.5 million, or 73.6%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and products gross profit margin increased from 17.5% to 55.0% due to the absence of software development cost amortization during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and a higher proportion of proprietary software sales over third party products. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.1 million and gross profit margin increased 247 basis points to 79.6%. The margin increase is the result of increased revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit decreased $0.7 million due to the drop in demand for professional services while gross profit margin increased from 28.9% to 32.7% due to a slightly larger decrease in the percentage of professional services costs compared to professional services revenue as a result of employee furloughs and layoffs, temporary salary reductions, lower incentive pay and employee benefits. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, severance and other charges, decreased $6.0 million, or 26.0%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Product development. Product development decreased $2.5 million, or 23.4%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to employee furloughs, temporary salary reductions, lower incentive pay and employee benefits, lower recruiting fees, and significantly reduced travel and outside service expenses due to employees working from home. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $2.5 million, or 51.9%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to temporary reductions in salaries and employee benefits, furloughs, and reduced commission expense 21 Table of Contents due to lower sales levels. The decrease also includes the impact of significantly reduced travel, the absence of in-person trade shows and conference activity , and the ability to conduct more business remotely . General and administrative. General and administrative decreased by $0.8 million, or 13.6%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to employee furloughs, temporary salary reductions, lower incentive pay and employee benefits offset by an increase in share-based compensation. Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges decreased $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to reduced severance activity. Other (Income) Expenses Three months ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 $ % Other (income) expense: Interest income $ (28 ) $ (114 ) $ (86 ) (75.4 )% Interest expense 2 2 0 nm Other expense, net 88 108 20 nm Total other (income) expense, net $ 62 $ (4 ) $ (66 ) nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense. Other expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three months ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 $ % Income tax expense $ 121 $ 41 $ (80 ) nm Effective tax rate 2.0 % (1.4 )% nm - not meaningful For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory tax rate due primarily to the utilization of net operating losses that were offset by decreases in the valuation allowances in the U.S, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 22 Table of Contents Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences . The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible .

Total net revenue decreased $14.9 million, or 18.9%, during the first half of fiscal 2021 compared to the first half of fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $10.9 million, or 48.1%, due to lower sales combined with delayed deliveries resulting from customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $2.4 million, or 5.9%, compared to the first half of fiscal 2020 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 16.4% during the first half of fiscal 2021 compared to the first half of fiscal 2020. The growth rate in our support, maintenance and subscription services is significantly lower than we have reported in recent periods due to one-time COVID-19 related financial relief we provided to certain customers during the first half of fiscal 2021 to help them as they deal with temporary site closures during the period. Professional services revenue decreased $6.4 million, or 40.0%, due to lower sales combined with delayed installations and integration of our software solutions resulting from travel and customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $1.5 million, or 3.7%, for the first half of fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 50.9% to 65.0% driven by changes in the composition of revenue by category. Products gross profit increased $1.5 million, or 34.9%, compared to the second half of fiscal 2020 and products gross profit margin increased from 19.0% to 49.4% due to the absence of software development cost amortization during the first half of fiscal 2021 along with a higher proportion of proprietary software sales over third party products. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.4 million and gross profit margin increased 116 basis points to 79.3%. The margin increase is the result of increased revenue on a relatively flat cost base. Professional services gross profit decreased $2.4 million and gross profit margin decreased from 27.1% to 20.2% due to the drop in demand for professional services resulting from travel and customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, severance and other charges, decreased $9.5 million, or 21.5%, during the first half of fiscal 2021 compared with the first half of fiscal 2020.

The decrease also includes the impact of significantly reduced travel, the absence of in-person trade shows and conference activity, and the ability to conduct more business remotely. 24 Table of Contents General and administrative. General and administrative decreased by $1.0 million , or 8.2 %, in the first half of fiscal 2021 compared with the first half of fiscal 2020 due to employee furloughs and layoffs, temporary salary reductions, lower incentive pay and employee benefits offset by an increase in share-based compensation. Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges increased $0.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2021 due to severance charges resulting from layoffs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, payments on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease obligations and preferred stock dividends. At September 30, 2020, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 97% were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. 25 Table of Contents The MAK Capital investment increased our cash balance by $34. 0 million after closing costs of $ 1.0 million. As described above under Recent Developments and further in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the transaction resulted in the issuance of 1,735,457 preferred shares with an annual dividend rate of 5 .25%. Our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and services, including the impact of changes in customer buying behavior due to circumstances over which we have no control, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we require additional funding, for operating needs, a business acquisition or otherwise, we may need access to more capital, which could involve borrowings under a credit facility. As of September 30, 2020, and March 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $85.7 million as of September 30, 2020 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 6,642 $ 1,234 Investing activities (473 ) (1,942 ) Financing activities 32,799 (1,065 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 85 (83 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 39,053 $ (1,856 ) Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $6.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The provision of cash was due primarily to the addition of $4.7 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, to our operating income of $5.4 million offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities. During the first six months of fiscal 2021, the $32.8 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.0 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $1.0 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation and $0.2 million in preferred stock dividends. During the first six months of fiscal 2020, the $1.1 million used in financing activities was primarily related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2020, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Other than as described in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2020. 26 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the six months ended September 30, 2020, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees are now working from home. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 27 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

COVID-19 Pandemic On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak has reached all geographic regions in which we do business, and government authorities around the world have implemented extensive measures attempting to contain the spread and mitigate the effects of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, closures of non-essential businesses, and social distancing requirements. The global spread of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response have negatively impacted us, our customers, our suppliers and the many communities in which we do business. The overall extent and duration of economic and business disruption is not currently known. In response to these challenges, we quickly adjusted our business policies and practices for employees to work from home and have taken other measures to continue our operations with safety as our priority. We continuously monitor and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including recommendations and orders from government and public health authorities. We are working to help our customers maintain their operations during this difficult time while managing our teams to be prepared for continuously changing demand for our products and services. See Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview— Recent Developments” of this report for a more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2021 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2020, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 22, 2020. Use of estimates 8 Table of Contents Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Considering the currently unknown extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply to certain of our significant accounting policies. We assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to us and the unknown future impacts COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020 and through the date of this report. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We describe our accounting policy for Series A convertible preferred stock further below. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed therein. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-1 5, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. We adopted ASU 2018-15 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. We adopted ASU 2018-13 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires a goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. We adopted ASU 2017-04 as of April 1, 2020 with no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) – Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This new standard requires entities to measure expected credit losses for certain financial assets held at the reporting date using a current expected credit loss model, which is based on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company’s financial instruments within the scope of this guidance primarily includes accounts receivable and contract assets. We adopted ASU 2016-13 as of April 1, 2020 under the modified retrospective approach. As a result, comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards applicable for those periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, given our limited historical write-off activity. 3. Revenue Recognition Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. 9 Table of Contents Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We use the market approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $ 5.2 million and $ 10.9 million, and over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $ 24.6 million and $ 27.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 17.5 million and $ 15.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred 10 Table of Contents to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $ 1.4 million and $ 2.0 million for the three months ended June 3 0 , 20 20 and 201 9 , respectively . Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of June 30, 2020 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. We had $ 3.2 million and $ 3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we expensed $ 0.6 million and $ 1.0 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 4.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in economic conditions that made it difficult to project future sales and revenue accurately for the related rGuest solutions. After evaluating the Company’s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software, an impairment charge was required. The amount of impairment recognized during the year ended March 31, 2020 reduced the carry value of capitalized software development costs to zero with no remaining amortization expense to be recognized in future periods. Amortization expense for software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $ 3.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. These charges are included as costs of goods sold - products in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 11 Table of Contents 5. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 6,811 $ 6,945 Other taxes payable 1,512 1,649 Severance liabilities 103 32 Professional fees 104 50 Other 271 357 Total $ 8,801 $ 9,033 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,110 $ 1,103 Asset retirement obligations 170 170 Employee benefit obligations 1,429 511 Other 77 76 Total $ 2,786 $ 1,860 12 Table of Contents 6. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information A dditional information related to the consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows : Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Cash (receipts) for interest, net ( 20 ) ( 79 ) Cash payments for income tax, net 134 73 Cash payments for operating leases 1,642 1,014 Cash payments for finance leases 8 8 Accrued capital expenditures 19 51 7. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019: Three Months Ended June 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 Income tax expense $ 8 $ 25 Effective tax rate ( 1.6 )% ( 1.6 )% For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. 8. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court’s summary judgement with respect to all claims except for two, which were not asserted against Agilysys. In early 2020, the Court of Appeals also denied Ameranth’s request for rehearing. Finally, Ameranth filed for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has not yet responded to the writ. We were not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgement ruling or writ of certiorari may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 13 Table of Contents 9. Loss per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing (loss) per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2020 2019 Numerator: Net loss $ ( 517 ) $ ( 1,575 ) Series A convertible preferred stock issuance costs ( 937 ) — Series A convertible preferred stock dividends ( 199 ) — Net loss available to common shareholders $ ( 1,653 ) $ ( 1,575 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 23,405 23,212 Loss per share - basic and diluted: Loss per share $ ( 0.07 ) $ ( 0.07 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, performance shares and preferred shares 3,560 1,273 Basic loss per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 194,587 and 445,829 of restricted shares at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic loss per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted loss per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 10. Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") for up to 2.0 million common shares, plus 957,575 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (""2011 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is 1.25 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. We record compensation expense related to stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and SSARs awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. During fiscal year 2020, we issued 125,000 SSAR awards which are subject to a market condition. The fair value of these awards is estimated using the Lattice option pricing model which utilizes a binary tree and includes multiple assumptions which include volatility and life of the award to determine an appropriate fair value based on the award grant date. 14 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Product development $ 172 $ 268 Sales and marketing 36 62 General and administrative 1,218 152 Total share-based compensation expense $ 1,426 $ 482 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2020 for SSARs awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 1,644,888 $ 21.07 Exercised ( 56,226 ) 11.16 Forfeited ( 11,276 ) 18.71 Expired ( 88 ) 14.22 Outstanding at June 30, 2020 1,577,298 $ 21.44 4.7 $ 6,028 Exercisable at June 30, 2020 942,608 $ 12.87 3.8 $ 5,887 Vested and expected to vest at June 30, 2020 1,577,298 $ 21.44 4.7 $ 6,028 As of June 30, 2020, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested SSARs was $ 4.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.1 years. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2020 for restricted shares awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2020 178,462 $ 19.89 Forfeited ( 13,995 ) 18.84 Outstanding at June 30, 2020 164,467 $ 19.98 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of June 30, 2020, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $ 1.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.7 years. 15 Table of Contents Performance Shares We awarded certain restricted shares to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is performance based. The number of shares that vest will be based on relative attainment of a performance metric and any unvested shares will forfeit upon settlement of the bonus. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2020 for the performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Shares Outstanding at April 1, 2020 30,120 Granted — Vested — Forfeited — Outstanding at June 30, 2020 30,120 Based on the performance goals, the Compensation Committee of the board of directors awarded 6,714 of the original 30,120 shares having a value of $ 0.1 million based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on July 16, 2020, the date that the Committee made its determination. The remaining 23,406 shares subject to the original annual incentive grant were forfeited and can never be earned by our Chief Executive Officer. 11. Preferred Stock Series A Convertible Preferred Stock On May 22, 2020, we completed the sale of 1,735,457 shares of our preferred stock, without par value, designated as “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) to MAK Capital Fund L.P. and MAK Capital Distressed Debt Fund I, LP (the “Holders”) each, in its capacity as a designee of MAK Capital One LLC (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2020, between the Company and the Purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 35 million. We incurred issuance costs of $ 0.9 million. We added all issuance costs that were netted against the proceeds upon issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption value. As disclosed in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Michael Kaufman, the Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of MAK Capital One LLC. Accounting Policy We classify convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets due to certain contingent redemption clauses that are at the election of the Holders. We increase the carrying value of the convertible preferred stock to its redemption value (described below) for all undeclared dividends using the interest method. The Convertible Preferred Stock has the following rights, preferences and restrictions (the Certificate of Amendment included as Exhibit 3.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 26, 2020, defines all terms not otherwise defined below): Voting The Holders will be entitled to one vote for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock upon all matters presented to the common shareholders of the Company , and except as otherwise provided by the Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Company or required by law, the Holders and common shareholders will vote together as one class on all matters. Additionally, certain matters specific to the Convertible Preferred Stock will require the approval of two-thirds of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class. Liquidation Preference Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the purchase price paid by the Purchaser, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the “Liquidation Preference”) and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. 16 Table of Contents Redemption On and after the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, the Company will have the right, and the Holders will have the right to require the Company, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the then-outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference. Conversion Each Holder will have the right, at its option, to convert its Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $ 20.1676 per share (as may be adjusted from time to time, as described in the Certificate of Amendment). Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, require conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock if, at any time after November 22, 2023 , the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is at least 150 % of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the Holders of the election to convert. Dividends The Holders are entitled to dividends on the Liquidation Preference at the rate of 5.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually either (i) 50% in cash and 50% in kind as an increase in the then-current Liquidation Preference or (ii) 100% in cash, at the option of the Company. The Holders are not entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis; however, certain anti-dilution adjustments to the Convertible Preferred Stock may be made in the event of such dividends. The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference and (ii) the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to receive at such time if the Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into common stock. Change in Control Events Upon certain change of control events involving the Company, the Company has the right, and each Holder has the right, in each case, at the initiating party’s election, to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its then-outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for cash consideration equal to (i) 150% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring prior to the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued, (ii) 125% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the third anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and (iii) 100% of the then-current Liquidation Preference for a change of control occurring on or following the fifth anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued . Standstill Restrictions The Purchaser and its affiliates are subject to certain customary standstill provisions that restrict them from, among other actions, acquiring additional securities of the Company if such acquisition would result in the Purchaser beneficially owning in excess of 25 % of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company until the later of the third anniversary of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock is initially issued and the date on which the Purchaser no longer has record or beneficial ownership of common stock and Convertible Preferred Stock that constitute at least 10 % of the outstanding common stock. 17 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 29 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys. Overview Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak has reached all geographic regions in which we do business, and government authorities around the world have implemented extensive measures attempting to contain the spread and mitigate the effects of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, closures of non-essential businesses, and social distancing requirements. The global spread of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response have negatively impacted us, our customers, our suppliers and the many communities in which we do business. The overall extent and duration of economic and business disruption is not currently known. In response to these challenges, we quickly adjusted our business policies and practices for employees to work from home and have taken other measures to continue our operations with safety as our priority. We continuously monitor and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including recommendations and orders from government and public health authorities. We are working to help our customers maintain their operations during this difficult time while managing our teams to be prepared for continuously changing demand for our products and services. During the first quarter, revenue was negatively impacted by delays and reduced spending attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers’ operational priorities and as a result of various one-time recurring revenue related and other concessions we have given to customers to help them during this time of need. Due to the pandemic, we have seen a reduction or delay in customer contracts and we have been unable to conduct face-to-face meetings with existing or prospective customers, present in-person demonstrations of our solutions, or host or attend in-person trade shows and conferences. Limitations on access to the facilities of our customers have also impacted our ability to deliver some of our products, complete certain implementations, and provide in-person consulting and training services, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue. We continued to experience high recurring revenue renewal rates during the first quarter. We have also begun to offer new software modules of our solutions designed to help our customers address challenges created by the pandemic now and into the future. Despite our strong first quarter recurring renewal rates and new solution offerings, we cannot predict how the pandemic will impact our results in future periods, including to the extent that customers delay or miss payments, customers defer, reduce, or refrain from placing orders or renewing subscriptions or maintenance arrangements, or travel restrictions and site access restrictions remain necessary. We continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These modifications may continue to delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. In addition, during the first quarter of our fiscal 2021, we reduced discretionary costs, implemented a hiring freeze on non-essential positions and reduced payroll and 18 Table of Contents related costs through layoffs, employee furloughs, employee retirement benefit limitations, and salary decreases for executive team members and certain other employees of the Company. These actions may have an adverse impact on us, particularly if they remain in place for an extended period. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as the situation evolves. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted and signed into U.S. law to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses facing economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. However, we plan to continue deferring the timing of employer payroll tax payments and accelerating the refund of AMT credits as permitted by the CARES Act. MAK Capital Investment In May 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell to MAK Capital One, LLC (“MAK Capital”) $35 million of convertible preferred stock carrying a 5.25% dividend that will be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 1,735,457 preferred shares which added $35 million in preferred stock to the Company’s balance sheet and increased our cash balance by the $35 million investment less closing costs of $0.9 million. The 5.25% dividends will accumulate and increase the liquidation preference of the preferred stock for any undeclared amounts. Our Business Agilysys has been a leader in hospitality software for more than 40 years, delivering innovative guest-centric technology solutions for casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, stadiums and arenas. Agilysys offers the most comprehensive solutions in the industry, including point of sale (POS), property management systems (PMS), inventory and procurement, payment solutions, and related hospitality applications, to manage the entire guest journey.

Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, Georgia. We strive to increase shareholder value by improving operating and financial performance and profitably growing the business through superior products and services. To that end, we expect to invest a certain portion of our cash on hand to fund enhancements to existing software products, to develop and market new software products, and to expand our customer breadth, both vertically and geographically.

Profitability and industry leading growth will be achieved through tighter management of operating expenses and sharpening the focus of our investments to concentrate on growth opportunities that offer the highest returns. 19 Table of Contents Revenue - Defined As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. Results of Operations First Fiscal Quarter 2021 Compared to First Fiscal Quarter 2020 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019: Three months ended June 30, Increase (decrease) 2020 2019 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 5,239 $ 10,869 $ (5,630 ) -51.8 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 20,497 20,082 415 2.1 Professional services 4,071 7,438 (3,367 ) -45.3 Total net revenue 29,807 38,389 (8,582 ) -22.4 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 3,015 8,623 (5,608 ) -65.0 Support, maintenance and subscription services 4,306 4,181 125 3.0 Professional services 3,936 5,571 (1,635 ) -29.3 Total cost of goods sold 11,257 18,375 (7,118 ) -38.7 Gross profit $ 18,550 $ 20,014 $ (1,464 ) -7.3 % Gross profit margin 62.2 % 52.1 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 8,266 $ 10,064 $ (1,798 ) -17.9 % Sales and marketing 2,601 4,498 (1,897 ) (42.2 ) General and administrative 5,719 5,874 (155 ) -2.6 Depreciation of fixed assets 723 213 510 239.4 Amortization of intangibles 461 678 (217 ) (32.0 ) Severance and other charges 1,203 231 972 420.8 Operating loss $ (423 ) $ (1,544 ) $ 1,121 (72.6 )% Operating loss percentage (1.4 )% (4.0 )% nm - not meaningful 20 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended June 30, 2020 2019 Net revenue: Products 17.6 % 28.3 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 68.8 52.3 Professional services 13.6 19.4 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 10.1 % 22.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 14.4 10.9 Professional services 13.3 14.5 Total cost of goods sold 37.8 % 47.9 % Gross profit 62.2 % 52.1 % Operating expenses: Product development 27.7 % 26.2 % Sales and marketing 8.7 11.7 General and administrative 19.2 15.3 Depreciation of fixed assets 2.5 0.5 Amortization of intangibles 1.5 1.8 Severance and other charges 4.0 0.6 Operating loss (1.4 )% (4.0 )% Net revenue. Total net revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 22.4%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Products revenue decreased $5.6 million, or 51.8%, due to lower sales combined with delayed deliveries resulting from customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $0.4 million, or 2.1%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 8.6% during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The growth rate in our support, maintenance and subscription services is significantly lower than we have reported in recent quarters due to one-time COVID-19 related financial relief we provided to certain customers during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to help them as they deal with temporary site closures during the period. Professional services revenue decreased $3.4 million, or 45.3%, due to lower sales combined with delayed installations and integration of our software solutions resulting from travel and customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit decreased $1.5 million, or 7.3%, for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and total gross profit margin increased from 52.1% to 62.2%. Products gross profit was flat at $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Products gross profit margin increased from 20.7% to 42.5% due to the absence of software development cost amortization during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 following the impairment of our rGuest suite of products during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 (see further discussion of the impairment in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $0.3 million and gross profit margin decreased 19 basis points to 79.0%. The margin decrease is the result of the COVID-19 related financial relief we provided to certain customers during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2021. Professional services gross profit decreased $1.7 million and gross profit margin decreased from 25.1% to 3.3% due to the drop in demand for professional services due to travel and customer restrictions including temporary site closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, severance and other charges, decreased $3.6 million, or 16.7%, during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Product development. Product development decreased $1.8 million, or 17.9%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to employee furloughs and layoffs, temporary salary reductions, lower incentive pay and employee benefits, a temporary hiring freeze effectively eliminating recruiting fees, and significantly reduced travel and outside service expenses due to employees working from home. 21 Table of Contents Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $1.9 million , or 42.2 % , in the first quarter of fiscal 202 1 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 20 20 due to employee furloughs and layoffs, temporary salary reductions, lower incentive pay and employee benefits, significantly reduced travel and the absence of in-person trade shows and conference activity. General and administrative. General and administrative decreased by $0.2 million, or 2.6%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to employee furloughs and layoffs, temporary salary reductions, lower incentive pay and employee benefits offset by an increase in share-based compensation. Severance and other charges. Severance, and other charges increased $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to severance charges resulting from layoffs. Other (Income) Expenses Three months ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 $ % Other (income) expense: Interest income $ (21 ) $ (80 ) $ (59 ) (73.8 )% Interest expense 1 1 0 nm Other expense, net 106 85 (21 ) nm Total other (income) expense, net $ 86 $ 6 $ (80 ) nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills and money market funds. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense. Other expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three months ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 $ % Income tax expense $ 8 $ 25 $ 17 nm Effective tax rate (1.6 )% (1.6 )% nm - not meaningful For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, payments on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease obligations and preferred stock dividends. 22 Table of Contents At June 30, 2020 , 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 9 6 % were located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. The MAK Capital investment increased our cash balance by $34.1 million after closing costs of $0.9 million. As described above under Recent Developments and further in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the transaction resulted in the issuance of 1,735,457 preferred shares with an annual dividend rate of 5.25%. Our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and services, including the impact of changes in customer buying behavior due to circumstances over which we have no control, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we require additional funding, for operating needs, a business acquisition or otherwise, we may need access to more capital, which could involve borrowings under a credit facility. As of June 30, 2020, and March 31, 2019, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $74.6 million as of June 30, 2020 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. Cash Flow Three Months Ended June 30, (In thousands) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ (4,929 ) $ (1,913 ) Investing activities (245 ) (573 ) Financing activities 33,123 (1,028 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 2 (24 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 27,951 $ (3,538 ) Cash flow used in operating activities. Cash flow used in operating activities was $4.9 million in the first three months of fiscal 2021. The use of cash was due primarily to the offset of $2.6 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, against our operating loss of $0.5 million and the decrease of $6.9 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. Consists primarily of property and equipment purchases. Cash flow provided by financing activities. During the first three months of fiscal 2021, the $33.1 million provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $34.1 million in preferred stock issuance proceeds from the MAK Capital investment, net of issuance costs, offset by $0.9 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. During the first three months of fiscal 2020, the $1.0 million used in financing activities was primarily related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2020, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2020. Other than as described in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies and estimates since March 31, 2020. 23 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Information This Quarterly Report and other publicly available documents, including the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference, contain, and our officers and representatives may from time to time make, ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will"" and similar references to future periods. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management’s current expectations, intentions, or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A in Part II of this Quarterly Report and Item IA of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” contained in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures since March 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO, CFO and Corporate Controller and Treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2020, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees are now working from home. The design of our financial reporting processes, systems, and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller and Treasurer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the impact of resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all possible future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 24 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Table amounts in thousands, except per share data) 1. Nature of Operations and Financial Statement Presentation Nature of Operations We serve five major market sectors: Gaming, both corporate and tribal; Hotels and Resorts; Cruise; Managed Foodservice, and Sports and Entertainment. A significant portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from contract support, maintenance and subscription services. Agilysys operates across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. For more information, visit www.agilysys.com. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2020 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 24, 2019. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our accounting policy for leases changed with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2016-02 (""Topic 842""), as described further below. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed therein. Reclassification – Certain prior year balances have been reclassed to conform to the current year presentation. Specifically, we reclassed certain employee benefit obligations from current to non-current liabilities. 8 Table of Contents Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions previously allowed in the standard and simplifies the accounting for income taxes by providing additional guidance for certain tax situations. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASU 2019-04 provides corrections, updates and clarifications to the previously issued updates ASU 2016-13, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-01. Various areas of the codification were impacted from the update. The standard follows the effective dates of the previously issued ASUs, unless an entity has already early adopted the previous ASUs, in which case the effective date will vary according to each specific ASU adoption. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and the other two ASUs affected by ASU 2019-04 are not applicable to us. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-1 5, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). ASU 2018-02 addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on items within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2019; the adoption had no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires a goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are still assessing the impact of this standard, we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Unlike Accounting Standard Codification Topic 840 (""Topic 840""), which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The most prominent change for leasees is the requirement to recognize both Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for leases 9 Table of Contents clas sified as operating leases under Topic 840. We adopted Topic 842 as of April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption. Please refer to Note 6, Leases for further details. 3. Revenue Recognition Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $12.1 million and $34.9 million, and $10.2 million and $28.1 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $29.9 million and $86.2 million, and $25.8 million and $76.1 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Nature of Goods and Services section below for additional information regarding revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams. Nature of Goods and Services Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or a refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. 10 Table of Contents We use the market estimate approach to drive standalone sellin g price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $8.6 million and $7.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $34.6 million and $28.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets at the beginning of the period, $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $2.7 million and $3.8 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2019 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. As of December 31, 2019, we had $3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019, we expensed $1.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $0.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. During the comparable periods ending December 31, 2018, we expensed $1.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 11 Table of Contents 4.

Remaining Amortization (In thousands) Expense Fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 $ 3,132 2021 12,515 2022 5,403 2023 3,399 2024 690 Total $ 25,139 Amortization expense for software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $3.1 million and $3.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and $9.4 million and $9.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These charges are included as costs of goods sold - products in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense relating to other definite-lived intangible assets was $11,500 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and $34,500 for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. These charges are classified as operating expenses - amortization of intangibles in our condensed consolidated statements of operations along with amortization expense related to our capitalized internal-use software that we classify in Property and equipment, net within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized software development costs for software internally developed to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, are carried on our balance sheet at carrying value, net of accumulated amortization. The Company did not capitalize any amounts for external-use software development costs during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 due to the current active projects, which carry a sufficiently short amount of time between achieving technological feasibility and reaching general availability to preclude capitalization. We capitalized approximately $2.0 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2018. 12 Table of Contents 5. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: December 31, 2019 March 31, 2019 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 10,438 $ 12,755 Other taxes payable 1,231 1,041 Accrued legal settlements — 15 Severance liabilities 86 46 Professional fees 127 67 Deferred rent — 273 Other 600 521 Total $ 12,482 $ 14,718 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,097 $ 1,083 Deferred rent and asset retirement obligations 165 2,613 Employee benefit obligations 279 174 Other 76 76 Total $ 1,617 $ 3,946 6. Leases We adopted Topic 842 on April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption to recognize leases with a duration greater than 12 months on the balance sheet. The impact of adoption on April 1, 2019 was recognition of operating lease liabilities of $16.3 million and related Right-of-Use (""ROU"") assets of $13.8 million. Prior period financial statements have not been restated and therefore the comparative amounts are not presented below or on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. For operating leases with a term greater than 12 months, we have recorded the lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term and the related ROU asset. The remaining lease term has been determined for each lease considering factors such as renewal options, termination options, our Company's historical practices in exercising such options, and current business knowledge which may impact lease related decisions. The majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of office equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by, or associated with our active leases. Since our current leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, our incremental borrowing rates used to determine the value of lease payments in implementation are estimated at April 1, 2019, based on collateralized rates for a term similar to each remaining lease term. We have elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which includes the ability to carryforward the previously determined lease classification (operating or financing), forgo the assessment whether active contracts contain a lease, and whether capitalized costs associated with a lease meet the definition of ""initial direct costs"" as defined within Topic 842. In the event that any of our leases contain nonlease components, we have elected the practical expedient to account for each separate lease component and the associated nonlease component(s) as a single lease component. We have also elected the accounting policy to forgo applying the guidance of Topic 842 to short term leases (defined as a term of 12 month or less, without a purchase option which we are reasonably certain to exercise). As of December 31, 2019, we have one additional operating lease for the extension of the office space at our India Development Center which has not yet commenced. In relation to this lease, we anticipate approximately $2.5 million and $2.5 million of ROU assets and lease liabilities, respectively. The operating lease commences during January 2020. We do not have any related party leases or sublease arrangements. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. 13 Table of Contents The components of lease expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 were as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (in thousands) December 31, 2019 Operating leases expense $ 1,001 $ 3,017 Finance lease expense: Amortization of ROU assets 6 17 Interest on lease liabilities 2 4 Total finance lease expense 8 21 Variable lease costs 60 197 Short term lease expense 22 72 Total lease expense $ 1,091 $ 3,307 Other information related to leases for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 was as follows: Nine Months Ended Supplemental cash flow information December 31, 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in thousands): Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 3,560 Operating cash flows for finance leases 9 Financing cash flows for finance leases 18 ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands): Operating leases $ 185 Finance leases 11 Weighted average remaining lease terms Operating leases 5.26 Finance leases 2.37 Weighted average discount rates Operating leases 10.04 % Finance leases 4.37 % The table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-cancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019: (in thousands) Operating leases Finance leases 2020 (excluding the nine months ended December 31, 2019) $ 1,086 $ 7 2021 4,390 29 2022 3,623 21 2023 2,244 5 2024 2,049 3 Thereafter 5,719 — Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments 19,111 65 Less: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease liabilities (5,076 ) (10 ) Total lease liabilities $ 14,035 $ 55 14 Table of Contents As previously disclosed on our March 31, 2019 Form 10-K and under the previous lease accounting standard, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable l eases as of March 31, 2019 were as follows: Year ending (in thousands) Operating leases Finance leases 2020 $ 4,143 $ 27 2021 3,945 23 2022 3,166 15 2023 1,916 — 2024 1,770 — Thereafter 4,497 — Total lease payments 19,437 65 Less: Amounts representing interest — (8 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 19,437 $ 57 7. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Income tax expense $ 95 $ 182 $ 161 $ 186 Effective tax rate (3.8 )% (4.7 )% (2.3 )% (2.0 )% For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. 8. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. All but one of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. In September 2018, the District Court found the one surviving Ameranth patent invalid and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In November 2019, the District Court's ruling was upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In early 2020, the Court of Appeals also denied Ameranth’s request for rehearing. It is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or the denial of Ameranth’s appeal may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 15 Table of Contents 9. Loss per S hare The following data shows the amounts used in computing (loss) per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Numerator: Net loss $ (2,582 ) $ (4,048 ) $ (7,075 ) $ (9,575 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding 23,240 23,048 23,230 23,030 Loss per share - basic and diluted: Loss per share $ (0.11 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.30 ) $ (0.42 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares and performance shares 1,469 1,471 1,414 1,443 Basic loss per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 416,960 and 482,846 of restricted shares at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic loss per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted loss per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 10. Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") for up to 2.0 million common shares, plus 957,575 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (""2011 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is 1.25 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. We record compensation expense related to stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and SSARs awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. 16 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Product development $ 639 $ 509 $ 1,579 $ 938 Sales and marketing 104 136 217 335 General and administrative 586 637 1,360 1,683 Total share-based compensation expense $ 1,329 $ 1,282 $ 3,156 $ 2,956 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 for SSARs awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 1,016,643 $ 11.22 Granted 91,364 22.41 Exercised (30,430 ) 9.47 Forfeited (15,704 ) 18.13 Expired (9,112 ) 10.35 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 1,052,761 $ 12.15 4.3 $ 13,959 Exercisable at December 31, 2019 825,908 $ 10.96 3.9 $ 11,931 As of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested SSARs was $0.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.6 years. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 for restricted shares awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 237,146 $ 13.46 Granted 197,460 22.57 Vested (2,757 ) 22.67 Forfeited (45,009 ) 17.01 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 386,840 $ 17.63 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $3.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.0 years. 17 Table of Contents Performance Shares We awarded certain restricted shares to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is performance based. The number of shares that vest will be based on relative attainment of a performance metric and any unvested shares will forfeit upon settlement of the bonus. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 for the performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Shares Outstanding at April 1, 2019 63,291 Granted 30,120 Vested (23,526 ) Forfeited (39,765 ) Outstanding at December 31, 2019 30,120 Based on the performance goals, management estimates a liability of approximately $450,000 to be settled through the vesting of a variable number of the performance shares subsequent to March 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested performance shares was $0.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3 months. 11. Fair Value Measurements We estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. We assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy. The hierarchy indicates the extent to which pricing inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Level 1 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and are the most observable. Level 2 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities that are either directly or indirectly observable, or other observable inputs such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates, and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market and include our own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable and unobservable inputs is reflected in the hierarchy assessment disclosed in the tables below. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The following tables present information about our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value: (In thousands) Recorded value as of December 31, 2019 Active markets for identical asset or liabilities (Level 1) Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs (Level 2) Active markets for unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 910 - - $ 910 (In thousands) Recorded value as of March 31, 2019 Active markets for identical asset or liabilities (Level 1) Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs (Level 2) Active markets for unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 895 - - $ 895 18 Table of Contents The recorded value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is adjusted to the cash surrender value of the policies obtained from the third party life insurance providers, which are not observable in the market, and therefore, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the cash surrender val ue of these policies are recorded within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The following table presents a summary of changes in the fair value of the Level 3 assets: Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 Corporate-owned life insurance: Balance on April 1 $ 895 $ 853 Unrealized loss relating to instruments held at reporting date (11 ) (12 ) Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements, net 26 27 Balance on December 31 $ 910 $ 868 19 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2019. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 29 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 for additional information concerning these items.

Revenue - Defined We separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. 20 Table of Contents • Support, maintena nce and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. Results of Operations Third Fiscal Quarter 2020 Compared to Third Fiscal Quarter 2019 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Three months ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2019 2018 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 12,126 $ 10,232 $ 1,894 18.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 20,965 19,345 1,620 8.4 Professional services 8,896 6,437 2,459 38.2 Total net revenue 41,987 36,014 5,973 16.6 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 9,639 8,371 1,268 15.1 Support, maintenance and subscription services 4,841 3,909 932 23.8 Professional services 6,443 5,087 1,356 26.7 Total cost of goods sold 20,923 17,367 3,556 20.5 Gross profit $ 21,064 $ 18,647 $ 2,417 13.0 % Gross profit margin 50.2 % 51.8 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 11,285 $ 10,059 $ 1,226 12.2 % Sales and marketing 4,918 5,217 (299 ) (5.7 ) General and administrative 6,084 5,865 219 3.7 Depreciation of fixed assets 854 651 203 31.2 Amortization of intangibles 608 675 (67 ) (9.9 ) Restructuring, severance and other charges 11 58 (47 ) nm Operating loss $ (2,696 ) $ (3,878 ) $ 1,182 (30.5 )% Operating loss percentage (6.4 )% (10.8 )% nm - not meaningful 21 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended December 31, 2019 2018 Net revenue: Products 28.9 % 28.4 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 49.9 53.7 Professional services 21.2 17.9 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 23.0 % 23.2 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 11.5 10.9 Professional services 15.3 14.1 Total cost of goods sold 49.8 % 48.2 % Gross profit 50.2 % 51.8 % Operating expenses: Product development 26.9 % 27.9 % Sales and marketing 11.7 14.5 General and administrative 14.5 16.3 Depreciation of fixed assets 2.0 1.8 Amortization of intangibles 1.5 1.9 Restructuring, severance and other charges 0.0 0.2 Operating loss (6.4 )% (10.8 )% Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $6.0 million, or 16.6%, during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Products revenue increased $1.9 million, or 18.5%, due to increased sales of third-party hardware including new customers and expansion with existing customers. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $1.6 million, or 8.4%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 driven by continued growth in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 24.8% during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Professional services revenue increased $2.5 million, or 38.2%, due to ongoing installations and integration of our software solutions for our growing customer base. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $2.4 million, or 13.0%, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and total gross profit margin decreased from 51.8% to 50.2%. Products gross profit increased $0.6 million and gross profit margin increased approximately 232 basis points to 20.5%. The improvement is primarily related to increased product revenue on a partially fixed cost base which includes software development cost amortization. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $0.7 million and gross profit margin decreased 288 basis points to 76.9%. The margin decrease is the result of costs incurred for the expansion of our teams and infrastructure to continue to support and host customers. Professional services gross profit increased $1.1 million and gross profit margin increased 660 basis points to 27.6% due to the increased efficiencies of implementation projects during the current quarter following the hiring and training of additional team members at the beginning of fiscal 2020 to meet growing demand for professional services. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $1.3 million, or 5.7%, during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Product development. Product development increased $1.2 million, or 12.2%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 due primarily to an increase in headcount and additional rent expense related to our India Development Center. 22 Table of Contents Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $0. 3 million, or 5.7 %, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2019 due to the overall consistency of sales and marketing team composition, compensation and activities. General and administrative. General and administrative increased by $0.2 million, or 3.7%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to increases in headcount and improvement of our internal systems to support our growing organization and business requirements.

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in treasury bills and commercial paper. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other (income) expense. Other (income) expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three months ended December 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Income tax expense $ 95 $ 182 $ 87 nm Effective tax rate (3.8 )% (4.7 )% nm - not meaningful For the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 23 Table of Contents Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of ou r deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences . The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on th e generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible.

Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $5.3 million, or 9.3%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019 driven by support and maintenance for the growth in customers using our on premise software products along with continued increases in subscription-based service revenue, which increased 22.2% during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Professional services revenue increased $4.8 million, or 24.2%, due to ongoing installation and integration of our software solutions for our growing customer base. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $7.0 million, or 12.9%, for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and total gross profit margin decreased slightly from 52.1% to 50.6%. Products gross profit increased $2.0 million and gross profit margin increased approximately 217 basis points to 19.5%. The improvement is primarily related to increased product revenue on a partially fixed cost base which includes software development cost amortization. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $3.5 million and gross profit margin decreased 97 basis points to 77.7%. Our slight margin decrease is due to the expansion of our teams and infrastructure to continue supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit increased $1.5 million and gross profit margin increased 112 basis points to 27.3% due to the increased efficiencies of implementation projects during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 following the hiring and training of additional team members at the beginning of fiscal 2020 to meet growing demand for professional services. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $5.6 million, or 8.9%, during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Product development. Product development increased $4.8 million, or 17.7%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019. $2.5 million of this increase was due to increased employee compensation and hiring costs from our continued expansion of our product development teams. The remaining $2.3 million was due to the reduction of cost capitalization. The products in our rGuest platform for which we capitalized costs reached general availability be the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products join our well established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. The Company capitalized $2.0 million of external use software costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs in first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company capitalized no software development costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2020. 25 Table of Contents Sales and marketing. Sale s and marketing de creased slightly by $0. 1 million, or 0.4 %, in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2019 due to the overall consistency of sales and marketing team composition, compensation and activities. General and administrative. General and administrative increased by $1.0 million, or 5.6%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2019 due primarily to increases in headcount and improvement of our internal systems to support our growing organization and business requirements. Restructuring, severance, and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges decreased $0.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019 due to a reduction in severance payments and executive search fees. Legal settlements, net. The Company received approximately $0.1 million of settlement funds during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 due to the resolution of an outstanding lawsuit involving a former employee; no further activity is expected related to this matter.

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in treasury bills and commercial paper. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense. Other expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Nine months ended December 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Income tax expense $ 161 $ 186 $ 25 nm Effective tax rate (2.3 )% (2.0 )% nm - not meaningful For the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are consistently subject to tax audits; due to the nature of examinations in multiple jurisdictions, changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 26 Table of Contents Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences . The ultimate rea lization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and employee tax withholdings payments for share-based compensation. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $41.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. At December 31, 2019, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents of which 93% is located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less, including investments in treasury bills and commercial paper. We believe credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash Flow Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 5,273 $ 1,719 Investing activities (3,035 ) (3,826 ) Financing activities (1,071 ) (702 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (33 ) (139 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,134 $ (2,948 ) Cash flow used in operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $5.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020. The provision of cash was due primarily to the offset of $16.3 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, against our operating loss of $7.1 million and the decrease of $3.6 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the first nine months of fiscal 2020, the $3.0 million used in investing activities consisted of property and equipment purchases. During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, the $3.8 million used in investing activities consisted of $1.6 million of property and equipment purchases along with $2.2 million of capitalized software development costs. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first nine months of fiscal 2020, the $1.1 million used in financing activities was primarily related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2020 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2019, as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended September 30, 2019, are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 24, 2019. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our accounting policy for leases changed with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2016-02 (""Topic 842""), as described further below. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed therein. 8 Table of Contents Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In April 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASU 2019-04 provides corrections, updates and clarifications to the previously issued updates ASU 2016-13, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-01. Various areas of the codification were impacted from the update. The standard follows the effective dates of the previously issued ASUs, unless an entity has already early adopted the previous ASUs, in which case the effective date will vary according to each specific ASU adoption. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and the other two ASUs affected by ASU 2019-04 are not applicable to us. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-1 5, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). ASU 2018-02 addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on items within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2019; the adoption had no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires a goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are still assessing the impact of this standard, we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Unlike Accounting Standard Codification Topic 840 (""Topic 840""), which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The most prominent change for leasees is the requirement to recognize both Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under Topic 840. We adopted Topic 842 as of April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption. Please refer to Note 6, Leases for further details. 9 Table of Contents 3. Revenue Recognition Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $11.9 million and $22.7 million, and $8.8 million and $17.8 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Revenue recognized over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $28.8 million and $56.4 million, and $25.4 million and $50.4 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Nature of Goods and Services section below for additional information regarding revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams. Nature of Goods and Services Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or a refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. Hardware is purchased from suppliers and provided to the end-user customers via drop-ship or from inventory. We are the primary obligor as we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. These services represent a stand-ready obligation that is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer; we account for these support and maintenance services as a single performance obligation recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. The Company recognizes subscription revenue over a one-month period based on the typical monthly invoicing and renewal cycle in accordance with our customer agreement terms. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. 10 Table of Contents We use the market estimate approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by max imizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transactio n price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $10.5 million and $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $26.0 million and $19.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Because the right to the transaction became unconditional, we transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets recognized at March 31, 2019, $0.4 million and $2.4 million during the three and six months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and from contract assets recognized at April 1, 2018, $0.2 million and $3.2 million during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2019 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. As of September 30, 2019, we had $3.4 million of capitalized sales incentive costs. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 , we expensed $1.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. During the comparable periods ending September 30, 2018, we expensed $0.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of sales commissions, which included amortization of capitalized amounts of $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. These expenses are included in operating expenses – sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 11 Table of Contents 4.

Remaining Amortization (In thousands) Expense Fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 $ 6,273 2021 12,515 2022 5,403 2023 3,399 2024 689 Total $ 28,279 Amortization expense for software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $3.1 million and $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and $6.3 million and $6.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These charges are included as costs of goods sold - products in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense relating to other definite-lived intangible assets was $11,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and $23,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. These charges are classified as operating expenses - amortization of intangibles in our condensed consolidated statements of operations along with amortization expense related to our capitalized internal-use software that we classify in Property and equipment, net within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized software development costs for software internally developed to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, are carried on our balance sheet at carrying value, net of accumulated amortization. The Company did not capitalize any amounts for external-use software development costs during the three and six months ended September 30, 2019. Current active projects which carry a sufficiently short amount of time between achieving technological feasibility and reaching general availability to preclude capitalization. We capitalized approximately $2.0 million during the six months ended September 30, 2018. 12 Table of Contents 5. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: September 30, 2019 March 31, 2019 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 8,269 $ 12,929 Other taxes payable 957 1,041 Accrued legal settlements — 15 Severance liabilities 146 46 Professional fees 131 67 Deferred rent — 273 Other 481 521 Total $ 9,984 $ 14,892 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,096 $ 1,083 Deferred rent and asset retirement obligations 165 2,613 Other 77 76 Total $ 1,338 $ 3,772 6. Leases We adopted Topic 842 on April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption to recognize leases with a duration greater than 12 months on the balance sheet. The impact of adoption on April 1, 2019 was recognition of operating lease liabilities of $16.3 million and related Right-of-Use (""ROU"") assets of $13.8 million. Prior period financial statements have not been restated and therefore the comparative amounts are not presented below or on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. For operating leases with a term greater than 12 months, we have recorded the lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term and the related ROU asset. The remaining lease term has been determined for each lease considering factors such as renewal options, termination options, our Company's historical practices in exercising such options, and current business knowledge which may impact lease related decisions. The majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of office equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by, or associated with our active leases. Since our current leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, our incremental borrowing rates used to determine the value of lease payments in implementation are estimated at April 1, 2019, based on collateralized rates for a term similar to each remaining lease term. We have elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which includes the ability to carryforward the previously determined lease classification (operating or financing), forgo the assessment whether active contracts contain a lease, and whether capitalized costs associated with a lease meet the definition of ""initial direct costs"" as defined within Topic 842. In the event that any of our leases contain nonlease components, we have elected the practical expedient to account for each separate lease component and the associated nonlease component(s) as a single lease component. We have also elected the accounting policy to forgo applying the guidance of Topic 842 to short term leases (defined as a term of 12 month or less, without a purchase option which we are reasonably certain to exercise). As of September 30, 2019, we have no leases which have not yet commenced. In addition, we do not have any related party leases or sublease arrangements. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. 13 Table of Contents The components of lease expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (in thousands) September 30, 2019 Operating leases expense $ 1,003 $ 2,016 Finance lease expense: Amortization of ROU assets 5 11 Interest on lease liabilities 1 3 Total finance lease expense 6 14 Variable lease costs 69 137 Short term lease expense 36 50 Total lease expense $ 1,114 $ 2,217 Other information related to leases for the six months ended September 30, 2019 was as follows: Six Months Ended Supplemental cash flow information September 30, 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in thousands): Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 2,210 Operating cash flows for finance leases 6 Financing cash flows for finance leases 12 ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands): Operating leases $ 185 Finance leases 6 Weighted average remaining lease terms Operating leases 5.40 Finance leases 2.22 Weighted average discount rates Operating leases 9.93 % Finance leases 4.30 % The table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-cancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2019: (in thousands) Operating leases Finance leases 2020 (excluding the six months ended September 30, 2019) $ 2,163 $ 14 2021 4,391 25 2022 3,630 17 2023 2,252 1 2024 2,057 — Thereafter 5,763 — Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments 20,256 57 Less: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted lease liabilities (5,446 ) (6 ) Total lease liabilities $ 14,810 $ 51 14 Table of Contents As previously disclosed on our March 31, 2019 Form 10-K and under the previous lease accounting standard, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable l eases as of March 31, 2019 were as follows: Year ending (in thousands) Operating leases Finance leases 2020 $ 4,143 $ 27 2021 3,945 23 2022 3,166 15 2023 1,916 — 2024 1,770 — Thereafter 4,497 — Total lease payments 19,437 65 Less: Amounts representing interest — (8 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 19,437 $ 57 7. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense and effective tax rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Income tax expense $ 41 $ 53 $ 67 $ 4 Effective tax rate (1.4 )% (1.4 )% (1.5 )% (0.1 )% For the three and six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. 8. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. Most of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. Cases against us and our co-defendants remained pending in the District Court with respect to one surviving Ameranth patent. In September 2018, the District Court found that patent invalid, and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In early 2019, Ameranth appealed the District Court's summary judgment ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We are not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or appeal may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 15 Table of Contents 9. Loss per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing (loss) per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Numerator: Net loss $ (2,918 ) $ (3,791 ) $ (4,493 ) $ (5,528 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding 23,238 23,131 23,225 23,113 Loss per share - basic and diluted: Loss per share $ (0.13 ) $ (0.16 ) $ (0.19 ) $ (0.24 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares and performance shares 1,494 1,481 1,386 1,419 Basic loss per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 418,854 and 486,701 of restricted shares at September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic loss per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted loss per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 10. Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") for up to 2.0 million common shares, plus 957,575 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (""2011 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is 1.25 million. We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. We record compensation expense related to stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and SSARs awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. 16 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Product development $ 672 $ 514 $ 940 $ 429 Sales and marketing 51 134 113 199 General and administrative 622 617 774 1,046 Total share-based compensation expense $ 1,345 $ 1,265 $ 1,827 $ 1,674 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2019 for SSARs awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 1,016,643 $ 11.22 Granted 91,364 22.41 Exercised (30,430 ) 9.47 Forfeited (14,706 ) 18.39 Expired (8,937 ) 10.27 Outstanding at September 30, 2019 1,053,934 $ 12.15 4.5 $ 14,183 Exercisable at September 30, 2019 773,583 $ 10.98 4.2 $ 11,321 As of September 30, 2019, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested SSARs was $0.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.7 years. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2019 for restricted shares awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 237,146 $ 13.46 Granted 190,042 22.49 Vested (2,757 ) 22.67 Forfeited (35,696 ) 16.81 Outstanding at September 30, 2019 388,735 $ 17.49 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of September 30, 2019, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $4.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.1 years. 17 Table of Contents Performance Shares We awarded certain restricted shares to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is performance based. The number of shares that vest will be based on relative attainment of a performance metric and any unvested shares will forfeit upon settlement of the bonus. The following table summarizes the activity during the six months ended September 30, 2019 for the performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: (In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of Shares Outstanding at April 1, 2019 63,291 Granted 30,120 Vested (23,526 ) Forfeited (39,765 ) Outstanding at September 30, 2019 30,120 Based on the performance goals, management estimates a liability of $450,000 to be settled through the vesting of a variable number of the performance shares subsequent to March 31, 2020. As of September 30, 2019, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested performance shares was $0.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 6 months. 11. Fair Value Measurements We estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. We assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy. The hierarchy indicates the extent to which pricing inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Level 1 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and are the most observable. Level 2 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities that are either directly or indirectly observable, or other observable inputs such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates, and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market and include our own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable and unobservable inputs is reflected in the hierarchy assessment disclosed in the tables below. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The following tables present information about our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value: (In thousands) Recorded value as of September 30, 2019 Active markets for identical asset or liabilities (Level 1) Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs (Level 2) Active markets for unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 904 - - $ 904 (In thousands) Recorded value as of March 31, 2019 Active markets for identical asset or liabilities (Level 1) Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs (Level 2) Active markets for unobservable inputs (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 895 - - $ 895 18 Table of Contents The recorded value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is adjusted to the cash surrender value of the policies obtained from the third party life insurance providers, which are not observable in the market, and therefore, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies are recorded within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The following table presents a summary of changes in the fair value of the Level 3 assets: Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2019 2018 Corporate-owned life insurance: Balance on April 1 $ 895 $ 853 Unrealized (loss) gain relating to instruments held at reporting date 7 8 Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements, net 2 2 Balance on September 30 $ 904 $ 863 19 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2019. Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 27 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 for additional information concerning these items.

Revenue - Defined We separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems. 20 Table of Contents • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarke ted ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. Results of Operations Second Fiscal Quarter 2020 Compared to Second Fiscal Quarter 2019 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018: Three months ended September 30, Increase (decrease) 2019 2018 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 11,873 $ 8,769 $ 3,104 35.4 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 20,329 18,856 1,473 7.8 Professional services 8,520 6,578 1,942 29.5 Total net revenue 40,722 34,203 6,519 19.1 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 9,794 7,703 2,091 27.1 Support, maintenance and subscription services 4,654 3,977 677 17.0 Professional services 6,057 4,774 1,283 26.9 Total cost of goods sold 20,505 16,454 4,051 24.6 Gross profit $ 20,217 $ 17,749 $ 2,468 13.9 % Gross profit margin 49.6 % 51.9 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 10,778 $ 10,151 $ 627 6.2 % Sales and marketing 4,890 4,393 497 11.3 General and administrative 6,038 5,176 862 16.7 Depreciation of fixed assets 707 676 31 4.6 Amortization of intangibles 614 674 (60 ) (8.9 ) Restructuring, severance and other charges 190 448 (258 ) (57.6 ) Legal settlements, net (119 ) 35 (154 ) nm Operating loss $ (2,881 ) $ (3,804 ) $ 923 (24.3 )% Operating loss percentage (7.1 )% (11.1 )% nm - not meaningful 21 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended September 30, 2019 2018 Net revenue: Products 29.2 % 25.6 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 49.9 55.1 Professional services 20.9 19.3 Total net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products 24.1 % 22.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 11.4 11.6 Professional services 14.9 14.0 Total cost of goods sold 50.4 % 48.1 % Gross profit 49.6 % 51.9 % Operating expenses: Product development 26.5 % 29.7 % Sales and marketing 12.0 12.8 General and administrative 14.8 15.1 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.7 2.0 Amortization of intangibles 1.5 2.0 Restructuring, severance and other charges 0.5 1.3 Legal settlements, net (0.3 ) 0.1 Operating loss (7.1 )% (11.1 )% Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $6.5 million, or 19.1%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Products revenue increased $3.1 million, or 35.4%, due to increased sales of third party hardware including new customers and expansion with existing customers. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $1.5 million, or 7.8%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 driven by growth in customers using our on premise software products which require the payment of support and maintenance along with continued increases in subscription based service revenue, which increased 15.7% during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Professional services revenue increased $1.9 million, or 29.5%, due to continued growth in our customer base which require installations of our traditional on premise and subscription based software solutions. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $2.5 million, or 13.9%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and total gross profit margin decreased from 51.9% to 49.6%. Products gross profit increased $1.0 million and gross profit margin increased approximately 535 basis points to 17.5%. The improvement is primarily related to increased product revenue on a partially fixed cost base which includes software development cost amortization. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $0.8 million and gross profit margin decreased 180 basis points to 77.1%. The margin decrease is the result of costs incurred for the expansion of our teams and infrastructure to continue to support and host customers. Professional services gross profit increased $0.7 million and gross profit margin increased 148 basis points to 28.9% due to the increase in implementation projects completed during the current quarter following the hiring and training of additional team members at the beginning of fiscal 2020 to meet growing demand for professional services. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $2.0 million, or 9.3%, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Product development. Product development increased $0.6 million, or 6.2%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due primarily to an increase in headcount and additional rent expense related to our India Development Center. 22 Table of Contents Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $0. 5 million, or 11.3 %, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to the timing of sales and marketing events. General and administrative. General and administrative increased by $0.9 million, or 16.7%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to increases in headcount and improvement of our internal systems to support our growing organization and business requirements. Restructuring, severance, and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges decreased $0.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 due to a reduction in severance payments and executive search fees. Legal settlements, net. The Company received approximately $0.1 million of settlement funds during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the resolution of an outstanding lawsuit involving a former employee; no further activity is expected related to this matter. Other Expenses (Income) Three months ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Other expense (income): Interest (income) $ (114 ) $ (97 ) $ (17 ) 17.5 % Interest expense 2 3 (1 ) nm Other expense, net 108 28 80 nm Total other expense (income), net $ (4 ) $ (66 ) $ 62 nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in treasury bills and commercial paper. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense. Other expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three months ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Income tax expense $ 41 $ 53 $ 12 nm Effective tax rate (1.4 )% (1.4 )% nm - not meaningful For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 23 Table of Contents Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantia lly all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences . The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible.

Total net revenue increased $10.9 million, or 16.0%, during the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to the first half of fiscal 2019. Products revenue increased $4.9 million, or 27.4%, due to increased sales of third party hardware including new customers and expansion with existing customers. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $3.6 million, or 9.9%, compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 driven by growth in customers using our on premise software products which require the payment of support and maintenance along with continued increases in subscription based service revenue, which increased 19.4% during the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to the first half of fiscal 2019. Professional services revenue increased $2.4 million, or 17.5%, due to continued growth in our customer base which requires installations of our traditional on premise and subscription based software solutions. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $4.6 million, or 12.9%, for the first half of fiscal 2020 and total gross profit margin decreased slightly from 52.2% to 50.9%. Products gross profit increased $1.3 million and gross profit margin increased approximately 212 basis points to 19.0%. The improvement is primarily related to increased product revenue on a partially fixed cost base which includes software development cost amortization. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.8 million and gross profit margin remained consistent at 78.1%. Margin steadiness is due to the expansion of our teams and infrastructure to continue supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit increased $0.4 million and gross profit margin decreased 151 basis points to 27.1% due to the hiring and training of additional team members at the beginning of fiscal 2020 to meet growing demand for professional services. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding legal settlements, restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $4.3 million, or 10.7%, during the first half of fiscal 2020 compared with the first half of fiscal 2019. Product development. Product development increased $3.6 million, or 20.9%, in the first half of fiscal 2020 due primarily to the reduction of cost capitalization and the continued expansion of our product development teams. The products in our rGuest platform for which we capitalized costs reached general availability be the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products join our well established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. The Company capitalized $2.0 million of external use software costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs in first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company capitalized no software development costs in the first half of fiscal 2020. 25 Table of Contents Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased slightly by $0. 2 million, or 2.7 %, in the first half of fiscal 2020 compared with the first half o f fiscal 2019 due primarily to the increase in sales incentives related to better progress through the first half of the year towards sales teams reaching established quotas . General and administrative. General and administrative increased by $0.7 million, or 6.5%, in the first half of fiscal 2020 compared with the first half of fiscal 2019 due primarily to increases in headcount and improvement of our internal systems to support our growing organization and business requirements. Restructuring, severance, and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges decreased $0.5 million during the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 due to a reduction in severance payments and executive search fees. Legal settlements, net. The Company received approximately $0.1 million of settlement funds during the first half of fiscal 2020 due to the resolution of an outstanding lawsuit involving a former employee; no further activity is expected related to this matter. Other Expenses (Income) Six months ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Other expense (income): Interest (income) $ (194 ) $ (152 ) $ (42 ) 27.6 % Interest expense 3 5 (2 ) nm Other expense, net 193 228 (35 ) (15.4 )% Total other expense, net $ 2 $ 81 $ (79 ) nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash equivalents including short-term investments in treasury bills and commercial paper. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense. Other expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Six months ended September 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Income tax expense $ 67 $ 4 $ (63 ) nm Effective tax rate (1.5 )% (0.1 )% nm - not meaningful For the six months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. 26 Table of Contents Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, as management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of these ded uctible differences . The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of finance lease and obligations at September 30, 2019. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $38.9 million as of September 30, 2019 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. As of September 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million, comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. At September 30, 2019, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents of which 92% is located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less, including investments in treasury bills and commercial paper. Therefore, we believe that credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash Flow Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,234 $ (2,748 ) Investing activities (1,942 ) (3,524 ) Financing activities (1,065 ) (616 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (83 ) (151 ) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,856 ) $ (7,039 ) Cash flow used in operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2020. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $4.5 million with offsetting adjustments of $10.3 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and a decrease of $4.6 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the first half of fiscal 2020, the $2.0 million used in investing activities consisted of property and equipment purchases. During the first half of fiscal 2019, the $3.5 million used in investing activities consisted of $1.3 million of property and equipment purchases along with $2.2 million of capitalized software development costs. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first half of fiscal 2020, the $1.1 million used in financing activities was primarily related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. Contractual Obligations As of September 30, 2019, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2019. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 27 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2019.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2020 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019 , as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019 , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 24, 2019. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our accounting policy for leases changed with 8 Table of Contents the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2016-02 (""Topic 842""), as described further below. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed therein. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In April 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASU 2019-04 provides corrections, updates and clarifications to the previously issued updates ASU 2016-13, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-01. Various areas of the codification were impacted from the update. The standard follows the effective dates of the previously issued ASUs, unless an entity has already early adopted the previous ASUs, in which case the effective date will vary according to each specific ASU adoption. Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, and the other two ASUs affected by ASU 2019-04 are not applicable to us. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-1 5, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). ASU 2018-02 addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on items within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2019; the adoption had no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires a goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are still assessing the impact of this standard, we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. 9 Table of Contents In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Unlike Accounting Standard Codification Topic 840 (""Topic 840""), which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance requires both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The most prominent change for leasees is the requirement to recognize both Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under Topic 840. We adopted Topic 842 as of April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption. Please refer to Note 6, Leases for further details. 3. Revenue Recognition Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $10.9 million and $9.1 million , and over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $27.5 million and $24.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. See Nature of Goods and Services section below for additional information regarding revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams. Nature of Goods and Services Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Performance obligations specific to each individual contract are defined within the terms of each purchase order. Each performance obligation is identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to our customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or a refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration, and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. A majority of our hardware sales involve shipment directly from its suppliers to the end-user customers. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor as we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. Each of these performance 10 Table of Contents obligations provide benefit to the customer on a standalone basis and are distinct in the context of the contract. Each of these distinct performance obligations represent a stand ready obligation to provide service to a customer, which is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer, which is why we account for these support services as a single performance obligation, recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for contracts that provide customers a right to access our software for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software at any time outside of the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when provided the right to access the software. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and any hosting services is not considered a distinct performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation to be recognized over the contract period. Typically, we invoice fees monthly and either party has the ability to cancel the agreement at each invoiced period. As a result, the contractual period for revenue recognition purposes is considered to be one month with monthly renewals for the term of the customer agreement. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services can be provided by internal or external providers, do not significantly affect the customer's ability to access or use other provided goods or services, and provide a measure of benefit beyond that of other promised goods or services in the contract. As a result, professional services are considered distinct in the context of the contract and represent a separate performance obligation. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. These contracts are reviewed quarterly for loss contract accounting treatment. We use the market estimate approach to drive standalone selling price (""SSP"") by maximizing observable data points (in the form of recently executed customer contracts) to determine the price customers are willing to pay for the goods and services transferred. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 15.6 million and $ 11.6 million , respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we transferred $ 2.0 million and $ 3.0 million to accounts receivable from contract assets recognized at March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively, because the right to the transaction consideration became unconditional. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. As a result, unsatisfied performance obligations as of June 30, 2019 are expected to be satisfied and the allocated transaction price recognized in revenue within a period of 12 months or less. 11 Table of Contents Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract Sales commission expenses that would not have occurred absent the customer contracts are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract. We have elected to take the practical expedient available to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected benefit and amortization period is one year or less. For subscription contracts that are renewed monthly based on an agreement term, we capitalize commission expenses and amortize as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. Other sales commission expenses have a period of benefit of one year or less, and are therefore expensed as incurred in line with the practical expedient elected. As of June 30, 2019 , we had $ 3.3 million of capitalized sales incentive costs. These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we expensed $1.0 million and $0.9 million , respectively, of sales commissions, including amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.3 million , respectively, which is included in operating expenses - sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. 4. Intangible Assets and Software Development Costs The following table summarizes our intangible assets and software development costs: June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019 Gross Net Gross Net carrying Accumulated carrying carrying Accumulated carrying (In thousands) amount amortization amount amount amortization amount Amortized intangible assets: Customer relationships $ 10,775 $ (10,775 ) $ — $ 10,775 $ (10,775 ) $ — Non-competition agreements 2,700 (2,700 ) — 2,700 (2,700 ) — Developed technology 10,398 (10,398 ) — 10,398 (10,398 ) — Trade names 230 (203 ) 27 230 (192 ) 38 Patented technology 80 (80 ) — 80 (80 ) — 24,183 (24,156 ) 27 24,183 (24,145 ) 38 Unamortized intangible assets: Trade names 8,400 N/A 8,400 8,400 N/A 8,400 Total intangible assets $ 32,583 $ (24,156 ) $ 8,427 $ 32,583 $ (24,145 ) $ 8,438 Software development costs $ 67,541 $ (36,149 ) $ 31,392 $ 67,541 $ (32,974 ) $ 34,567 The following table summarizes our remaining amortization expense relating to in service intangible assets and software development costs. Remaining Amortization (In thousands) Expense Fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 $ 9,413 2021 12,515 2022 5,403 2023 3,399 2024 689 Total $ 31,419 12 Table of Contents Amortization expense for software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $3.2 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These charges are included as costs of goods sold - products in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense relating to other definite-lived intangible assets was $11,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 . These charges are classified as operating expenses - amortization of intangibles in our condensed consolidated statements of operations along with amortization expense related to our capitalized internal-use software that we classify in Property and Equipment, net within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized software development costs for software internally developed to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, are carried on our balance sheet at carrying value, net of accumulated amortization. The Company did not capitalize any amounts for external-use software development costs during the three months ended June 30, 2019 due to the current active projects which carry a sufficiently short amount of time between achieving technological feasibility and reaching general availability to preclude capitalization. We capitalized approximately $2.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 . 5. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 7,585 $ 12,929 Other taxes payable 1,319 1,041 Accrued legal settlements 15 15 Severance liabilities 34 46 Professional fees 189 67 Deferred rent — 273 Other 332 521 Total $ 9,474 $ 14,892 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,090 $ 1,083 Deferred rent and asset retirement obligations 165 2,613 Other 76 76 Total $ 1,331 $ 3,772 6. Leases We adopted Topic 842 on April 1, 2019 using the current period adjustment method of adoption to recognize leases with a duration greater than 12 months on the balance sheet. The impact of adoption on April 1, 2019 was recognition of operating lease liabilities of $16.3 million and related Right-of-Use (""ROU"") assets of $13.8 million. Prior period financial statements have not been restated and therefore the comparative amounts are not presented below or on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019 . For operating leases with a term greater than 12 months, we have recorded the lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term and the related ROU asset. The remaining lease term has been determined for each lease considering factors such as renewal options, termination options, our company's historical practices in exercising such options, and current business knowledge which may impact lease related decisions. The majority of our leases are comprised of real estate leases for our respective offices around the globe. Our finance leases consist of office equipment. We have no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by, or associated with our active leases. Since our current leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, our incremental borrowing rates used to determine the value of lease payments in implementation are estimated at April 1, 2019, based on collateralized rates for a term similar to each lease term. 13 Table of Contents We have elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which includes the ability to carryforward the previously determined lease classification (operating or financing), forgo the assessment whether active contracts contain a lease, and whether capitalized costs associated with a lease meet the definition of ""initial direct costs"" as defined within Topic 842. In the event that any of our leases contain nonlease components, we have elected the practical expedient to account for each separate lease component and the associated nonlease component(s) as a single lease component. We have also elected the accounting policy to forgo applying the guidance of Topic 842 to short term leases (defined as a term of 12 month or less, without a purchase option which we are reasonably certain to exercise). As of June 30, 2019 , we have no leases which have not yet commenced. In addition, we do not have any related party leases or sublease arrangements. We have variable payments for expenses such as common area maintenance and taxes. We do not have variable payments that are based on an index or rate. As a result, we do not include variable payments in the calculation of the lease liability. Any variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. The components of lease expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were as follows: (in thousands) Three months ended June 30, 2019 Operating leases expense $ 1,013 Finance lease expense: Amortization of ROU assets 6 Interest on lease liabilities 2 Total finance lease expense 8 Variable lease costs 68 Short term lease expense 14 Total lease expense $ 1,103 Other information related to leases was as follows: Three months ended June 30, 2019 Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in thousands): Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 1,014 Operating cash flows for finance leases 6 Financing cash flows for finance leases 2 ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (in thousands): Operating leases $ 185 Finance leases — Weighted average remaining lease terms Operating leases 5.57 Finance leases 2.35 Weighted average discount rates Operating leases 9.85 % Finance leases 4.25 % The table below reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments (displayed by year and in the aggregate) under non-cancelable leases with terms of more than one year to the total lease liabilities recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 : 14 Table of Contents (in thousands) Operating leases Finance leases 2020 (excluding the three months ended June 30, 2019) $ 3,260 $ 22 2021 4,432 23 2022 3,669 15 2023 2,291 — 2024 2,099 — Thereafter 5,913 — Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments 21,664 60 Less: difference between undiscounted lease payments and discounted operating lease liabilities (5,923 ) (5 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 15,741 $ 55 As previously disclosed on our March 31, 2019 Form 10-K and under the previous lease accounting standard, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of March 31, 2019 were as follows: Year ending (in thousands) Operating leases Finance leases 2020 $ 4,143 $ 27 2021 3,945 23 2022 3,166 15 2023 1,916 — 2024 1,770 — Thereafter 4,497 — Total lease payments 19,437 65 Less: Amounts representing interest — (8 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 19,437 $ 57 15 7. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense (benefit) and effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 : Three months ended June 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 25 $ (49 ) Effective tax rate (1.6 )% 2.7 % For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. 8. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g. restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. The case against us was consolidated with similar cases brought by Ameranth against more than 30 other defendants. Most of the patents at issue in the case were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2016. Cases against us and our co-defendants remained pending in the District Court with respect to one surviving Ameranth patent. In September 2018, the District Court found that patent invalid, and granted summary judgment in favor of the movant co-defendants. In early 2019, Ameranth appealed the District Court's summary judgment ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We are not a party to the appeal, and it is currently unclear what impact the summary judgment ruling or appeal may have on our case. Ameranth seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees from us. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 16 Table of Contents 9. Loss per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing (loss) per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three months ended June 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2019 2018 Numerator: Net loss $ (1,575 ) $ (1,736 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding 23,212 23,095 Loss per share - basic and diluted: Loss per share $ (0.07 ) $ (0.08 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares and performance shares 1,273 1,356 Basic loss per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 445,829 and 490,117 of restricted shares at June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic loss per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted loss per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 10. Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") for up to 2.0 million common shares, plus 957,575 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (""2011 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is 1.25 million . We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. We record compensation expense related to stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and SSARs awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. 17 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: Three months ended June 30, (In thousands) 2019 2018 Product development $ 268 $ (85 ) Sales and marketing 62 65 General and administrative 152 429 Total share-based compensation expense $ 482 $ 409 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2019 for SSARs awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 1,016,643 $ 11.22 Granted 91,364 22.41 Exercised (23,545 ) 8.47 Forfeited (2,380 ) 14.22 Cancelled/expired (3,839 ) 9.60 Outstanding at June 30, 2019 1,078,243 $ 12.23 4.8 $ 10,048 Exercisable at June 30, 2019 733,066 $ 11.00 4.4 $ 7,672 As of June 30, 2019 , total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested SSARs was $0.9 million , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.8 years. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2019 for restricted shares awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 237,146 $ 13.46 Granted 189,160 22.47 Vested — — Forfeited (10,597 ) 13.06 Outstanding at June 30, 2019 415,709 $ 17.56 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of June 30, 2019 , total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $4.7 million , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.8 years. 18 Table of Contents Performance Shares We awarded certain restricted shares to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is performance based. The number of shares that vest will be based on relative attainment of a performance metric and any unvested shares will forfeit upon settlement of the bonus. The following table summarizes the activity during the three months ended June 30, 2019 for the performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: Number of Shares (In thousands, except share and per share data) Outstanding at April 1, 2019 63,291 Granted 30,120 Vested (23,526 ) Forfeited (39,765 ) Outstanding at June 30, 2019 30,120 Based on the performance goals, management estimates a liability of $450,000 to be settled through the vesting of a variable number of the performance shares subsequent to March 31, 2020 . As of June 30, 2019 , total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested performance shares was $405,000 , which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 9 months . 19 Table of Contents 11. Fair Value Measurements We estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. We assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy. The hierarchy indicates the extent to which pricing inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Level 1 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and are the most observable. Level 2 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities that are either directly or indirectly observable, or other observable inputs such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates, and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market and include our own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable and unobservable inputs is reflected in the hierarchy assessment disclosed in the tables below. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 . The following tables present information about our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value: Fair value measurement used Recorded value as of Active markets for identical assets or liabilities Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs Active markets for unobservable inputs (In thousands) June 30, 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 901 — — $ 901 Fair value measurement used Recorded value as of Active markets for identical assets or liabilities Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs Active markets for unobservable inputs (In thousands) March 31, 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 895 — — $ 895 The recorded value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is adjusted to the cash surrender value of the policies obtained from the third party life insurance providers, which are not observable in the market, and therefore, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies are recorded within “Other (income) expenses, net” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The following table presents a summary of changes in the fair value of the Level 3 assets: Three months ended June 30, (In thousands) 2019 2018 Corporate-owned life insurance: Balance on April 1 $ 895 $ 853 Unrealized gain relating to instruments held at reporting date 4 4 Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements, net 2 2 Balance on June 30 $ 901 $ 859 20 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2019 . Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 27 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys.

In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Revenue - We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of software licenses, third party hardware and operating systems • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. Results of Operations First Fiscal Quarter 2020 Compared to First Fiscal Quarter 2019 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 : Three months ended June 30, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 10,869 $ 9,080 $ 1,789 19.7 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 20,082 17,929 2,153 12.0 Professional services 7,438 6,998 440 6.3 Total net revenue 38,389 34,007 4,382 12.9 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 8,623 7,130 1,493 20.9 Support, maintenance and subscription services 4,181 4,074 107 2.6 Professional services 5,571 4,914 657 13.4 Total cost of goods sold 18,375 16,118 2,257 14.0 Gross profit $ 20,014 $ 17,889 $ 2,125 11.9 % Gross profit margin 52.1 % 52.6 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 10,064 $ 7,089 $ 2,975 42.0 % Sales and marketing 4,498 4,754 (256 ) (5.4 ) General and administrative 5,874 6,005 (131 ) (2.2 ) Depreciation of fixed assets 213 606 (393 ) (64.9 ) Amortization of intangibles 678 543 135 24.9 Restructuring, severance and other charges 231 440 (209 ) (47.5 ) Legal settlements — 91 (91 ) nm Operating loss $ (1,544 ) $ (1,639 ) $ 95 (5.8 )% Operating loss percentage (4.0 )% (4.8 )% nm - not meaningful 23 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our condensed consolidated statement of operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended June 30, 2019 2018 Net revenue: Products 28.3 % 26.7 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 52.3 52.7 Professional services 19.4 20.6 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 22.5 % 21.0 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 10.9 12.0 Professional services 14.5 14.4 Total 47.9 % 47.4 % Gross profit 52.1 % 52.6 % Operating expenses: Product development 26.2 % 20.8 % Sales and marketing 11.7 14.0 General and administrative 15.3 17.7 Depreciation of fixed assets 0.5 1.8 Amortization of intangibles 1.8 1.6 Restructuring, severance and other charges 0.6 1.3 Legal settlements — 0.3 Operating loss (4.0 )% (4.8 )% Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $4.4 million , or 12.9% , during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . Products revenue increased $1.8 million , or 19.7% , due to increased sales of on premise software and third party hardware including new customers and expansion with existing customers. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $2.2 million , or 12.0% , compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 driven by growth in customers using our on premise software products which require the payment of support and maintenance along with continued increases in subscription based service revenue, which increased 23.5% during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . Professional services revenue increased $0.4 million , or 6.3% , due to growth in our customer base, including installations of our traditional on premise and subscription based software solutions. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $2.1 million , or 11.9% , for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and total gross profit margin decreased slightly from 52.6% to 52.1% . Products gross profit increased $0.3 million and gross profit margin decreased approximately 80 basis points to 20.7% primarily as a result of increased developed technology amortization. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.0 million and gross margin increased 190 basis points to 79.2% due to the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit decreased $0.2 million and gross profit margin decreased 470 basis points to 25.1% due to the hiring and training of additional team members at the beginning of fiscal 2020 to meet growing demand for professional services. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $2.3 million , or 12.3% , during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . 24 Table of Contents Product development. Product development increased $3.0 million , or 42.0% , in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due primarily to the reduction of cost capitalization and the continued expansion of our product development teams. The products in our rGuest platform for which we capitalized costs reached general availability by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products join our well established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. The Company capitalized $2.0 million of external use software development costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs in the three months ended June 30, 2018 . The Company capitalized no software development costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $0.3 million , or 5.4% , in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to the timing of sales and marketing events. General and administrative. General and administrative decreased slightly by $0.1 million , or 2.2% , in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to reduced share-based compensation. Depreciation. We had a $0.4 million benefit in the fiscal 2020 first quarter that did not impact the fiscal 2019 first quarter and will not affect our ongoing depreciation expense in future quarters. Restructuring, severance, and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges decreased $0.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to a reduction in severance payments and executive search fees. Other Expenses (Income) Three months ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Other expense (income): Interest (income) $ (80 ) $ (55 ) $ 25 45.5 % Interest expense 1 3 2 nm Other expense, net 85 198 113 nm Total other expense, net $ 6 $ 146 $ 140 nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on short-term investments in treasury bills, commercial paper and corporate-owned life insurance policies. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with finance leases. Other expense. Other expense consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. Income Taxes Three months ended June 30, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2019 2018 $ % Income tax expense (benefit) $ 25 $ (49 ) $ (74 ) nm Effective tax rate (1.6 )% 2.7 % nm - not meaningful 25 Table of Contents For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. Because of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease and rental obligations at June 30, 2019 . We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $37.2 million as of June 30, 2019 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019 , our total debt was approximately $0.1 million , comprised of finance lease obligations in both periods. At June 30, 2019 , 100% of our cash and cash equivalents of which 92% is located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments with original maturity from the date of acquisition of three months or less, including investments in treasury bills and commercial paper. Therefore, we believe that credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash Flow Three months ended June 30, (In thousands) 2019 2018 Net cash (used in): Operating activities $ (1,913 ) $ (1,363 ) Investing activities (573 ) (2,878 ) Financing activities (1,028 ) (525 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (24 ) (101 ) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,538 ) $ (4,867 ) Cash flow used in operating activities. Cash flow used in operating activities was $1.9 million in the first three months of fiscal 2020 . The use of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $1.6 million with offsetting adjustments of $4.5 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation and a decrease of $4.9 million in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the first three months of fiscal 2020 , the $0.6 million used in investing activities consisted of property and equipment purchases. During the first three months of fiscal 2019, the $2.9 million used in investing activities consisted of $0.7 million of property and equipment purchases along with $2.1 million of capitalized software development costs. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first three months of fiscal 2020 , the $1.0 million used in financing activities was primarily comprised of $1.0 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. 26 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2019 , there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2019 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Agilysys operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. For more information, visit www.agilysys.com. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts consolidated with our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on March 31st. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2019 refers to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. Our unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information, the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 , as well as the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , are unaudited. However, these financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the audited annual financial statements, except for the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described below. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been made. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2018 , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 25, 2018. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our accounting policy for revenue recognition changed with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2014-09 (""Topic 606""), as described further below. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed therein. 7 Table of Contents Reclassification - Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Specifically, we have elected to present our changes in operating assets and liabilities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as a single line item. Prior year results have been condensed to be consistent with current year presentation. Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract . ASU 2018-15 addresses the treatment of implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update does not impact the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption (including early adoption in any interim period) permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . ASU 2018-13 addresses the required disclosures around fair value measurement. The disclosure requirements of the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, the policy for timing transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 measurements have been removed. Certain modifications were made to required disclosures and additional requirements were established. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements and 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases . ASU 2018-11 provides for an additional optional adoption method of ASU 2016-02, Leases , allowing for the application of the new standard as of the adoption date and recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. ASU 2018-10 provides corrections and updates to the previously issued codification regarding Topic 842. Various areas of the codification were impacted from the update. The two standards follow the effective dates of ASU 2016-02, Leases . Consistent with the documentation below, we are still assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02, however we anticipate the adoption of the standard will materially affect our consolidated financial statements given the significance of our leases. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). ASU 2018-02 addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate on items within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business , and ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . ASU No. 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018; the adoption had no impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires goodwill impairment to be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of its goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. While we are still assessing the impact of this standard, we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method, with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial adoption. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018; the adoption had no impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which provides guidance with the intent of reducing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have adopted this standard as of April 1, 2018; the adoption had no impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . This new standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Entities will be required to use a model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses for trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The new standard is effective for annual periods, and for interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for all periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and we are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements, but we anticipate that the new guidance will materially impact our consolidated financial statements given the significance of our leases. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted ASU No. 2014-09 as of April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. Please refer to Note 3, ""Revenue Recognition"" for further details. 3. Revenue Recognition On April 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. Results for reporting periods beginning after the adoption date are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under prior guidance. Disaggregation of Revenue We derive and report our revenue from the sale of products (software and hardware including server, storage, and point of sale), support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services. Revenue recognized at a point in time (products) totaled $10.2 million and $28.1 million , and over time (support, maintenance and subscription services and professional services) totaled $25.8 million and $76.1 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 , 9 Table of Contents respectively. See Nature of Goods and Services section below for additional information regarding revenue recognition procedures for our revenue streams. Nature of Goods and Services Our customary business practice is to enter into legally enforceable written contracts with our customers. The majority of our contracts are governed by a master agreement between us and the customer, which sets forth the general terms and conditions of any individual contract between the parties, which is then supplemented by a customer purchase order to specify the different goods and services, the associated prices, and any additional terms for an individual contract. Multiple contracts with a single counterparty entered into at the same time are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. Capable of being distinct means the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us. Distinct in the context of the contract means the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled and expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Typically, our contracts do not provide our customer with any right of return or refund; we do not constrain the contract price as it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal due to a return or a refund. Typically, our customer contracts contain one or more of the following goods or services which constitute performance obligations. Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software. Generally, our contracts do not provide significant services of integration and customization and installation services are not required to be purchased directly from us. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support. We have concluded that the software license is distinct as the customer can benefit from the software on its own. Software revenue is typically recognized when the software is delivered or made available for download to the customer. Revenue for hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when obligations that affect the customer's final acceptance of the arrangement have been fulfilled. A majority of our hardware sales involve shipment directly from its suppliers to the end-user customers. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor as we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms and product returns with the customer, and we bear the credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods. As the principal contact with the customer, we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped. In certain limited instances, as shipping terms dictate, revenue is recognized upon receipt at the point of destination or upon installation at the customer site. Support and maintenance revenue is derived from providing telephone and on-line technical support services, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when-and-if-available basis. Each of these performance obligations provide benefit to the customer on a standalone basis and are distinct in the context of the contract. Each of these distinct performance obligations represent a stand ready obligation to provide service to a customer, which is concurrently delivered and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer, which is why we account for these support services as a single performance obligation, recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement. Our subscription service revenue is comprised of fees for Software as a Service (“SaaS”) contracts that provide customers a right to access our software, which we maintain, and host in a data center, for a subscribed period. We do not provide the customer the contractual right to license the software outside of the data center at any time during the subscription period under these contracts. The customer can only benefit from the software and software maintenance when combined with the hosting service since the right to access is only provided to the software hosted in the data center. Accordingly, each of the rights to access the software, the maintenance services, and the hosting services is not considered a distinct 10 Table of Contents performance obligation in the context of the contract and should be combined into a single performance obligation and recognized over the contract period. Typically, we invoice fees monthly. Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for consulting, installation, integration and training and are generally recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the professional services as the services are being performed. Professional services that are billed on a time and materials basis are recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on labor hours expended to date relative to the total labor hours expected to be required to satisfy the related performance obligation. We estimate standalone selling price (""SSP"") based on the price at which the performance obligations are sold by considering certain specific factors related to our company together with customer information. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP basis. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold. Revenue is recorded net of any applicable taxes collected and remitted to governmental agencies. Contract Balances Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that we have transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The majority of our contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to professional services. We expect billing and collection of our contract assets to occur within the next twelve months. We receive payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules and accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or consideration which is unconditionally due from customers prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was $ 7.6 million and $ 28.1 million . During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 , we transferred $ 0.4 million and $ 3.8 million to accounts receivable from contract assets recognized at April 1, 2018 because the right to the transaction consideration became unconditional. Our arrangements are for a period of one year or less. We had approximately $ 42 million of remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2018 , which we expect to recognize over the next twelve months . Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract We capitalize commission expenses paid to internal sales personnel as expenses that are incremental to obtaining customer contracts. We have determined that these commission expenses are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. Capitalized sales commissions are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period the goods or services are expected to be transferred to the customer to which the assets relate, which can range as long as five years. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. We have capitalized $ 1.9 million of sales incentive costs in prior periods as part of our opening retained earnings adjustment on April 1, 2018. Capitalized sales incentive costs as of December 31, 2018 was $ 2.9 million . These balances are included in other non-current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet and are amortized as we satisfy the underlying performance obligations, generally based on the contract terms and anticipated renewals. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 , we expensed $1.3 million and $3.1 million of sales commissions, which includes amortization of capitalized amounts of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively; included in operating expenses - sales and marketing in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. All other costs to obtain a contract are not considered incremental and therefore are expensed as incurred. Financial Statement Impact of Adoption on Previously Reported Results 11 Table of Contents We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative impact of applying the new guidance to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of April 1, 2018 was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the adoption date. As a result of applying the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard, the following adjustments were made to noted accounts on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 1, 2018: (In thousands) March 31, 2018 Adjustment from Topic 606 April 1, 2018 Assets: Accounts receivable, net 16,389 3,124 19,513 Contract assets — 4,583 4,583 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 5,593 (496 ) 5,097 Other non-current assets 2,484 2,409 4,893 Liabilities: Contract liabilities 26,820 7,006 33,826 Shareholders' equity: Retained earnings 103,601 2,614 106,215 The acceleration of revenue that was deferred under prior guidance as of the adoption date was primarily attributable to the requirement of Topic 606 to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative basis using SSP rather than allocating under the residual method, which allocates the entire arrangement discount to the delivered performance obligations. Due to the Company's full valuation allowance as of the adoption date, there is no tax impact associated with the adoption of Topic 606. We made certain presentation changes to our condensed consolidated balance sheet on April 1, 2018 to comply with Topic 606. Prior to adoption of the new standard, we offset accounts receivable and contract liabilities (previously presented as deferred revenue on our condensed consolidated balance sheet) for unpaid deferred performance obligations included in contract liabilities. Under the new standard, we record accounts receivable and related contract liabilities for non-cancelable contracts with customers when the right to consideration is unconditional. Upon adoption, the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time were reclassified from accounts receivable to contract assets. Impact of Topic 606 on Financial Statement Line Items The impact of adoption of Topic 606 on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 was as follows: 12 Table of Contents December 31, 2018 As reported Balance without adoption of Topic 606 Effect of Change Higher (Lower) (In thousands) Assets: Accounts receivable, net 33,640 23,801 9,839 Contract assets 4,221 — 4,221 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4,334 4,751 (417 ) Other non-current assets 5,515 2,860 2,655 Liabilities: Contract liabilities 39,935 26,391 13,544 Shareholders' equity: Retained earnings 96,640 93,886 2,754 Three months ended December 31, 2018 As reported Balance without adoption of Topic 606 Effect of Change Higher (Lower) (In thousands) Net revenue: Products 10,232 9,889 343 Support, maintenance and subscription services 19,345 19,558 (213 ) Professional services 6,437 6,699 (262 ) Total net revenue: 36,014 36,146 (132 ) Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 5,217 5,351 (134 ) Net Loss (4,048 ) (4,050 ) (2 ) Nine months ended December 31, 2018 As reported Balance without adoption of Topic 606 Effect of Change Higher (Lower) (In thousands) Net revenue: Products 28,081 26,982 1,099 Support, maintenance and subscription services 56,130 56,752 (622 ) Professional services 20,013 20,593 (580 ) Total net revenue: 104,224 104,327 (103 ) Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 14,363 14,606 (243 ) Net Loss (9,575 ) (9,715 ) (140 ) The adoption of Topic 606 had no material impact to cash used in operating, investing or financing activities on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 13 Table of Contents 4. Restructuring Charges We recognize restructuring charges when a plan that materially changes the scope of our business or the manner in which that business is conducted is adopted and communicated to the impacted parties, and the expenses have been incurred or are reasonably estimable. Fiscal 2018 Restructuring Plan As of December 31, 2018 , we had a remaining liability of approximately $20,000 recorded for the fiscal 2018 restructuring plan. Following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the restructuring liability: Balance at Provisions/Adjustments Payments Balance at (In thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2018 Fiscal 2018 Restructuring Plan: Restructuring and other employment costs $ 198 $ — $ (178 ) $ 20 Total restructuring costs $ 198 $ — $ (178 ) $ 20 14 Table of Contents 5.

Estimated Amortization (In thousands) Expense Fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 $ 3,257 2020 12,599 2021 12,515 2022 5,403 2023 3,399 2024 689 Total $ 37,862 Amortization expense for software development costs related to assets to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed was $3.4 million and $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and $9.4 million and $7.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. These charges are included as costs of goods sold - products in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense relating to other definite-lived intangible assets was $11,500 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and $34,500 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . These charges are classified as operating expenses - amortization of intangibles in our condensed consolidated statements of operations along with amortization expense related to our capitalized internal-use software that we classify in Property and Equipment, net within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized software development costs for software internally developed to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, are carried on our balance sheet at carrying value, net of accumulated amortization. The Company did not capitalize any amounts for external-use software development costs during the three months ended December 31, 2018 due to the current active projects which carry a sufficiently short amount of time between achieving technological feasibility and 15 Table of Contents reaching general availability to preclude capitalization. We capitalized approximately $1.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 , and $2.0 million and $6.5 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 6. Additional Balance Sheet Information Additional information related to the condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows: (In thousands) December 31, 2018 March 31, 2018 Accrued liabilities: Salaries, wages, and related benefits $ 10,483 $ 6,793 Other taxes payable 1,120 769 Restructuring liabilities 20 198 Severance liabilities 33 — Professional fees 143 288 Deferred rent 430 407 Other 643 786 Total $ 12,872 $ 9,241 Other non-current liabilities: Uncertain tax positions $ 1,342 $ 1,519 Deferred rent 2,060 2,313 Other 77 79 Total $ 3,479 $ 3,911 Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts was $33.6 million and $16.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018 , respectively. The related allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.8 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018 , respectively. 7. Income Taxes The following table compares our income tax expense (benefit) and effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 : Three months ended Nine months ended December 31, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 182 $ (1,623 ) $ 186 $ (1,439 ) Effective tax rate (4.7 )% 45.6 % (2.0 )% 15.0 % For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 , the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, a SAB 118 and Tax Act deferred tax adjustment including the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, certain foreign and state tax effects, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 , the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to a $1.3 million benefit resulting from the effect of a reduction in the deferred rate due to federal tax reform, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, 16 certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. On December 22, 2017, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (""SAB"") No. 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB No. 118 allows registrants to record provisional amounts for a period up to one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act when the registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. As of March 31, 2018, it was uncertain if and to what extent various states would enact legislation to conform to the Tax Act. As legislative guidance and accounting interpretations were expected in the future, we considered the accounting of the deferred tax remeasurement including the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, to be incomplete and therefore only considered amounts related to these items to be reasonably estimated as of March 31, 2018 . We completed the accounting for the Tax Act during Q3 fiscal 2019 and recorded an adjustment on December 31, 2018 of $0.2 million to increase our deferred tax liability associated with certain indefinite lived intangibles. 8. Commitments and Contingencies Agilysys is the subject of various threatened or pending legal actions and contingencies in the normal course of conducting its business. We provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount or timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not possible to predict with certainty, management believes that the ultimate resolution of such individual or aggregated matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Ameranth alleges, among other things, that point-of-sale and property management and other hospitality information technology products, software, components and/or systems sold by us infringe a patent owned by Ameranth purporting to cover generation and synchronization of menus, including restaurant menus, event tickets, and other products across fixed, wireless and/or internet platforms as well as synchronization of hospitality information and hospitality software applications across fixed, wireless and internet platforms. The complaint seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of this lawsuit, or any possible monetary exposure associated with the lawsuit. However, we dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 17 Table of Contents 9. (Loss) per Share The following data shows the amounts used in computing (loss) per share and the effect on earnings and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common shares. Three months ended Nine months ended December 31, December 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Numerator: Net loss $ (4,048 ) $ (1,934 ) $ (9,575 ) $ (8,138 ) Denominator: Weighted average shares outstanding 23,048 22,851 23,030 22,777 Loss per share - basic and diluted: Loss per share $ (0.18 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.42 ) $ (0.36 ) Anti-dilutive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares and performance shares 1,471 1,658 1,443 1,705 Basic loss per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 482,846 and 530,138 of restricted shares at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic loss per share at the balance sheet dates. Diluted loss per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights (""SSARs""), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of share-based compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, for all periods presented, basic weighted-average shares outstanding were used in calculating the diluted net loss per share. 10. Share-based Compensation We may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and restricted share units under our shareholder-approved 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (""2016 Plan"") for up to 2.0 million common shares, plus 957,575 common shares, the number of shares that were remaining for grant under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (""2011 Plan"") as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan, plus the number of shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Plan that are forfeited, settled in cash, canceled or expired. The maximum aggregate number of restricted shares or restricted share units that may be granted under the 2016 Plan is 1.25 million . We may distribute authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to satisfy share option and appreciation right exercises or restricted share and performance share awards. We record compensation expense related to stock options, SSARs, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and SSARs awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares. 18 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations: Three months ended Nine months ended December 31, December 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Product development $ 509 $ 456 $ 938 $ 982 Sales and marketing 136 173 335 529 General and administrative 637 829 1,683 2,265 Total share-based compensation expense 1,282 1,458 2,956 3,776 Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights SSARs are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled in common shares of Agilysys, Inc. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2018 for SSARs awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per right) (in years) Outstanding at April 1, 2018 1,103,160 $ 10.60 Granted 158,244 14.22 Exercised (179,681 ) 10.28 Forfeited (43,960 ) 10.85 Cancelled/expired (6,138 ) 10.62 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 1,031,625 $ 11.20 5.0 $ 2,155 Exercisable at December 31, 2018 576,277 $ 10.60 4.5 $ 2,155 As of December 31, 2018 , total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non-vested SSARs was $0.7 million , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.9 years. Restricted Shares We granted shares to certain of our Directors, executives and key employees, the vesting of which is service-based. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2018 for restricted shares awarded under the 2011 and 2016 Plans: Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In thousands, except share and per share data) (per share) Outstanding at April 1, 2018 243,354 $ 10.78 Granted 249,949 14.32 Vested (10,000 ) 12.47 Forfeited (63,748 ) 10.71 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 419,555 $ 12.93 The weighted-average grant date fair value of the restricted shares is determined based upon the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. As of December 31, 2018 , total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $2.6 million , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.9 years. 19 Table of Contents Performance Shares We awarded certain restricted shares to our Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of which is performance based. The number of shares that vest will be based on relative attainment of a performance metric and any unvested shares will forfeit upon settlement of the bonus. The following table summarizes the activity during the nine months ended December 31, 2018 for the performance shares awarded under the 2016 Plan: Number of Shares (In thousands, except share and per share data) Outstanding at April 1, 2018 91,463 Granted 63,291 Forfeited (75,641 ) Vested (15,822 ) Outstanding at December 31, 2018 63,291 Based on the performance goals, management estimates a liability of $450,000 to be settled through the vesting of a variable number of the performance shares subsequent to March 31, 2019 . As of December 31, 2018 , total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non-vested performance shares was $135,000 , which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 3 months . 20 Table of Contents 11. Fair Value Measurements We estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. We assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy. The hierarchy indicates the extent to which pricing inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Level 1 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and are the most observable. Level 2 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities that are either directly or indirectly observable, or other observable inputs such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates, and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market and include our own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The use of observable and unobservable inputs is reflected in the hierarchy assessment disclosed in the tables below. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the nine months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . The following tables present information about our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value: Fair value measurement used Recorded value as of Active markets for identical assets or liabilities Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs Active markets for unobservable inputs (In thousands) December 31, 2018 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 868 — — $ 868 Fair value measurement used Recorded value as of Active markets for identical assets or liabilities Quoted prices in similar instruments and observable inputs Active markets for unobservable inputs (In thousands) March 31, 2018 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Corporate-owned life insurance — non-current $ 853 — — $ 853 The recorded value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is adjusted to the cash surrender value of the policies obtained from the third party life insurance providers, which are not observable in the market, and therefore, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies are recorded within “Other expenses (income), net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table presents a summary of changes in the fair value of the Level 3 assets: Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 Corporate-owned life insurance: Balance on April 1 $ 853 $ 809 Unrealized (loss) relating to instruments held at reporting date (12 ) (11 ) Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements, net 27 27 Balance on December 31 $ 868 $ 825 21 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”), management explains the general financial condition and results of operations for Agilysys and subsidiaries including: — what factors affect our business; — what our earnings and costs were; — why those earnings and costs were different from the year before; — where the earnings came from; — how our financial condition was affected; and — where the cash will come from to fund future operations. The MD&A analyzes changes in specific line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and provides information that management believes is important to assessing and understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q updates information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as well as our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2018 . Information provided in the MD&A may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” on page 27 of this Quarterly Report, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in Part II of this Quarterly Report, and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 for additional information concerning these items. Management believes that this information, discussion, and disclosure is important in making decisions about investing in Agilysys.

Results for operating periods beginning after the adoption date are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under prior guidance in effect at that time. For additional information regarding the adoption of this accounting standard, please refer to Note 3, ""Revenue Recognition"" in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item I of this report for further details. As required by the SEC, we separately present revenue earned as products revenue, support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or professional services revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition to the SEC requirements, we may, at times, also refer to revenue as defined below. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms we use to describe our revenue may be different from those used by other companies and caution should be used when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenue: • Products revenue – Revenue earned from the sales of hardware equipment and proprietary and remarketed software. • Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue – Revenue earned from the sale of proprietary and remarketed ongoing support, maintenance and subscription or hosting services. • Professional services revenue – Revenue earned from the delivery of implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Third Fiscal Quarter 2019 Compared to Third Fiscal Quarter 2018 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 : Three months ended December 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 10,232 $ 8,156 $ 2,076 25.5 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 19,345 17,215 2,130 12.4 Professional services 6,437 5,939 498 8.4 Total net revenue 36,014 31,310 4,704 15.0 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 8,371 6,820 1,551 22.7 Support, maintenance and subscription services 3,909 4,132 (223 ) (5.4 ) Professional services 5,087 4,730 357 7.5 Total cost of goods sold 17,367 15,682 1,685 10.7 Gross profit $ 18,647 $ 15,628 $ 3,019 19.3 % Gross profit margin 51.8 % 49.9 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 10,059 $ 7,269 $ 2,790 38.4 % Sales and marketing 5,217 4,278 939 21.9 General and administrative 5,865 6,114 (249 ) (4.1 ) Depreciation of fixed assets 651 581 70 12.0 Amortization of intangibles 675 471 204 43.3 Restructuring, severance and other charges 58 378 (320 ) (84.7 ) Legal settlements — 150 (150 ) nm Operating loss $ (3,878 ) $ (3,613 ) $ (265 ) 7.3 % Operating loss percentage (10.8 )% (11.5 )% nm - not meaningful 25 Table of Contents The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Three months ended December 31, 2018 2017 Net revenue: Products 28.4 % 26.0 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 53.7 55.0 Professional services 17.9 19.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 23.2 % 21.8 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 10.9 13.2 Professional services 14.1 15.1 Total 48.2 % 50.1 % Gross profit 51.8 % 49.9 % Operating expenses: Product development 27.9 % 23.2 % Sales and marketing 14.5 13.6 General and administrative 16.3 19.5 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.8 1.9 Amortization of intangibles 1.9 1.5 Restructuring, severance and other charges 0.2 1.2 Legal settlements — 0.5 Operating loss (10.8 )% (11.5 )% Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $4.7 million , or 15.0% , during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Products revenue increased $2.1 million , or 25.5% , due to growth in both third party hardware sales and proprietary on premise software sales, both of which grew more than 20% compared to the prior year. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $2.1 million , or 12.4% , compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 driven by growth in customers using our on premise software products which require the payment of support and maintenance along with continued increases in subscription based service revenue, which increased approximately 25% during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Professional services revenue increased $0.5 million , or 8.4% , as a result of growth in our customer base including installations of our traditional on premise and subscription based software solutions and increased use of our technical services team for customer specific software development projects. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $3.0 million , or 19.3% , for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and total gross profit margin increased 1.9% to 51.8% from 49.9% . Products gross profit increased $0.5 million and gross profit margin increased 1.8% to 18.2% primarily due to higher proprietary on premise software sales. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.4 million and gross margin increased 3.8% to 79.8% due primarily to the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit increased $0.1 million and gross profit margin increased 0.6% to 21.0% due to increased revenue with a relatively consistent increase in cost. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $3.8 million , or 20.1% , during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . 26 Table of Contents Product development. Product development increased $2.8 million , or 38.4% , in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to the absence of cost capitalization. The products in our rGuest platform for which we had capitalized costs reached general availability by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products join our well established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. The Company did not capitalize any amounts for external-use software development costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 due to the relatively short development cycle associated with the agile development of our current active products. We capitalized approximately $2.1 million in total development costs during the three months ended December 31, 2017 . Total product development costs, including operating expenses and capitalized amounts, were $10.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $9.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The $0.7 million increase is mostly due to the continued expansion of our R&D teams. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased by $0.9 million , or 21.9% , in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 due primarily to a $0.5 million increase in commissions and incentive compensation as well as $0.3 million of increased advertising and promotional expense related to the timing of marketing events. General and administrative. General and administrative decreased $0.2 million , or 4.1% , in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 mostly due to a $0.2 million reduction in stock compensation for executive grants. Restructuring, severance, and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges decreased $0.3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the non-recurring nature of the 2018 restructuring activities. Other Expenses (Income) Three months ended December 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ % Other expense (income): Interest (income) $ (83 ) $ (13 ) $ 70 nm Interest expense 3 3 — — % Other expense (income), net 68 (46 ) (114 ) nm Total other (income), net $ (12 ) $ (56 ) $ (44 ) nm nm - not meaningful Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on investments in certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and corporate-owned life insurance policies. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of costs associated with capital leases. Other expense (income). Other expense (income) consists mainly of the impact of foreign currency due to movement of European and Asian currencies against the US dollar. 27 Table of Contents Income Taxes Three months ended December 31, (Unfavorable) favorable (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ % Income tax expense (benefit) $ 182 $ (1,623 ) $ (1,805 ) nm Effective tax rate (4.7 )% 45.6 % nm - not meaningful For the three months ended December 31, 2018 , the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, adjustments to uncertain tax positions, a SAB 118 and Tax Act deferred tax adjustment including the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, certain foreign and state tax effects, and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 , the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to a $1.3 million benefit resulting from the effect of a reduction in the deferred rate due to passage of the Tax Act, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the range of zero to $0.1 million of tax and zero to $0.2 million of interest based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time. We have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. 28 Results of Operations First Nine Months Fiscal 2019 Compared to First Nine Months Fiscal 2018 Net Revenue and Operating Loss The following table presents our consolidated revenue and operating results for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 : Nine months ended December 31, Increase (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ % Net revenue: Products $ 28,081 $ 25,758 $ 2,323 9.0 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 56,130 50,990 5,140 10.1 Professional services 20,013 18,557 1,456 7.8 Total net revenue 104,224 95,305 8,919 9.4 Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 23,204 19,862 3,342 16.8 Support, maintenance and subscription services 11,960 12,610 (650 ) (5.2 ) Professional services 14,775 15,160 (385 ) (2.5 ) Total cost of goods sold 49,939 47,632 2,307 4.8 Gross profit $ 54,285 $ 47,673 $ 6,612 13.9 % Gross profit margin 52.1 % 50.0 % Operating expenses: Product development $ 27,299 $ 20,708 $ 6,591 31.8 % Sales and marketing 14,363 13,616 747 5.5 General and administrative 17,047 18,475 (1,428 ) (7.7 ) Depreciation of fixed assets 1,933 1,892 41 2.2 Amortization of intangibles 1,892 1,421 471 33.1 Restructuring, severance and other charges 948 1,241 (293 ) (23.6 ) Legal settlements 126 150 (24 ) (16.0 ) Operating loss $ (9,323 ) $ (9,830 ) $ 507 (5.2 )% Operating loss percentage (8.9 )% (10.3 )% nm - not meaningful 29 The following table presents the percentage relationship of our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to our consolidated net revenues for the periods presented: Nine months ended December 31, 2018 2017 Net revenue: Products 26.9 % 27.0 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 53.9 53.5 Professional services 19.2 19.5 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold: Products (inclusive of developed technology amortization) 22.3 % 20.9 % Support, maintenance and subscription services 11.4 13.2 Professional services 14.2 15.9 Total 47.9 % 50.0 % Gross profit 52.1 % 50.0 % Operating expenses: Product development 26.2 % 21.7 % Sales and marketing 13.8 14.3 General and administrative 16.3 19.4 Depreciation of fixed assets 1.9 2.0 Amortization of intangibles 1.8 1.5 Restructuring, severance and other charges 0.9 1.3 Legal settlements 0.1 0.2 Operating loss (8.9 )% (10.3 )% Net revenue. Total net revenue increased $8.9 million , or 9.4% , during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018 . Products revenue increased $2.3 million , or 9.0% , due to growth in both third party hardware sales and proprietary on premise software sales. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue increased $5.1 million , or 10.1% , compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018 driven by growth in customers using our on premise software products which require the payment of support and maintenance along with continued increases in subscription based service revenue, which increased approximately 23.6% during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018 . Professional services revenue increased $1.5 million , or 7.8% , as a result of growth in our customer base including installations of our traditional on premise and subscription based software solutions and increased use of our technical services team for customer specific software development projects. Gross profit and gross profit margin. Our total gross profit increased $6.6 million , or 13.9% , for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and total gross profit margin increased 2.1% to 52.1% from 50.0% . Products gross profit decreased $1.0 million and gross profit margin decreased approximately 5.5% to 17.4% primarily as a result of increased developed technology amortization. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $5.8 million and gross margin increased 3.4% to 78.7% due primarily to the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit increased $1.8 million and gross profit margin increased 7.9% to 26.2% due to increased revenue with lower cost from restructuring of our professional services workforce during the first quarter of 2018 into a more efficient operating structure with more limited use of contract labor. Operating expenses Operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements, restructuring, severance and other charges, increased $6.4 million , or 11.4% , during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2018 . 30 Product development. Product development increased $6.6 million , or 31.8% , in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cost capitalization. The products in our rGuest platform for which we had capitalized costs reached general availability by the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These products join our well established products with the application of agile development practices in a more dynamic development process that involves higher frequency releases of product features and functions. The Company capitalized $2.0 million of external use software development costs, and $0.3 million of internal use software development costs in the nine months ended December 31, 2018 , with the full balance capitalized in Q1 fiscal 2019. We capitalized approximately $ 8.2 million in total development costs during the nine months ended December 31, 2017 . Total product development costs, including operating expenses and capitalized amounts, were $29.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to $28.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The $0.7 million increase is mostly due to the continued expansion of our R&D teams. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing increased $0.7 million , or 5.5% , in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2018 mostly due to increased commissions and incentive compensation as a result of our continued revenue growth. General and administrative. General and administrative decreased $1.4 million , or 7.7% , in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due to approximately $1.1 million reduction in professional and outside services costs and a $0.2 million reduction in compensation expense. Restructuring, severance, and other charges. Restructuring, severance, and other charges during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2018 decreased $0.3 million , or 23.6% due to non-recurring 2018 restructuring activities.

Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $37.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements in the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018 , our total debt was approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million , comprised of capital lease obligations in both periods. At December 31, 2018 , 100% of our cash and cash equivalents were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. We maintain approximately 90% of our cash and cash equivalents in the United States. Therefore, we believe that credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents. 32 Table of Contents Cash Flow Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,719 $ 2,098 Investing activities (3,826 ) (12,588 ) Financing activities (702 ) (1,282 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (139 ) 132 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,948 ) $ (11,640 ) Cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 excluded approximately $7.3 million of capitalized software development costs which were reflected in investing activities. Cash flow provided by operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 excluded approximately $2.2 million of capitalized software development costs which were reflected in investing activities. This reduction is related to a change in development and deployment practices that no longer permit capitalization of such costs. This results in the inclusion of this type of cost in operating activities rather than investing activities and is the main driver of decreased cash provided by operating activities during the current fiscal year. Cash flow used in investing activities. For the first nine months of fiscal 2019 , the $3.8 million in cash used in investing activities was comprised of $2.2 million for the development of proprietary software and $1.6 million for purchase of property and equipment compared to $7.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively, in fiscal 2018. The reduction in expenditures associated with development of proprietary software is described above under cash flow provided by operating activities. The reduction in expenditures associated with property and equipment is due to payments associated with the establishment of our India Development Center in fiscal 2018, as well as reduced capitalization of internal use software and reduced equipment purchases in fiscal 2019. Cash flow used in financing activities. During the first nine months of fiscal 2019 , the $0.7 million used in financing activities was primarily comprised of $0.6 million related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding on share based compensation. The reduction from fiscal 2018 is primarily related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy employee tax withholding associated with the timing of vesting of grants in fiscal 2018. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2018 , there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as presented in our Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2018 .

All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding the prospects of TerrAscend’s industry or TerrAscend’s prospects, plans, financial position or business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""can"", “expect”, “likely”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “potential”, “proposed”, “estimate” and other similar words, including negative and grammatical variations thereof, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” happen, or by discussions of strategy. Forward-looking statements include estimates, plans, expectations, opinions, forecasts, projections, targets, guidance, or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: Certain of the forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and the general expectations of TerrAscend concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by TerrAscend using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry. Such data is inherently imprecise. The cannabis industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors, which factors are described further below. With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, TerrAscend has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which TerrAscend operates; (iii) the output from TerrAscend’s operations; (iv) consumer interest in TerrAscend’s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of TerrAscend’s activities; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) TerrAscend’s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; and (x) TerrAscend’s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of TerrAscend, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States (""U.S."") relating to cannabis operations in the U.S.; and those discussed under Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 16, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The purpose of forward-looking statements is to provide the reader with a description of management’s expectations, and such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for any other purpose. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. TerrAscend can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on the date such forward-looking statements are made.

TerrAscend operates a number of synergistic businesses, including Gage (""Gage""), a cultivator, processor and retailer in Michigan; KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings LLC (collectively ""Pinnacle""); The Apothecarium (“The Apothecarium”), a cannabis dispensary with several retail locations in California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; TerrAscend NJ, LLC (""TerrAscend NJ""), a cultivator, processor and retailer with operations in New Jersey; Ilera Healthcare (“Ilera”), Pennsylvania’s medical cannabis cultivator, processor and dispenser; vertically integrated operations in Maryland which include HMS Health, LLC and HMS Processing, LLC (collectively “HMS”), a cannabis cultivator and process or, Allegany Medical Marijuana Dispensary (""AMMD""), Peninsula Alternative Health (""Peninsula""), Blue Ridge Wellness (""Blue Ridge""), and Herbiculture Inc. (""Herbiculture""); Valhalla Confections, a cannabis-infused edibles brand; and State Flower, a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Francisco. Notwithstanding various states in the U.S. which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Effective July 4, 2023, the Company commenced trading of its common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX""), under the ticker symbol ""TSND"". Beginning on May 3, 2017 until the Company's listing on the TSX, common shares of the Company were traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange under ticker symbol ""TER"". The common shares of the Company began trading on OTCQX on October 22, 2018 under the ticker symbol ""TRSSF"" and changed its ticker symbol to ""TSNDF"" effective July 6, 2023. The Company’s registered office is loc ated at 77 City Centre Drive, Suite 501, Mississauga, Ontario, L5B 1M5. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) of the Company and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and operating results. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023, or any other interim or future periods. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value as described herein. At September 30, 2023, TerrAscend had an accumulated deficit of $ 662,075 . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, TerrAscend incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $ 8,439 and $ 40,472 , respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023 the Company’s current liabilities exceed its current assets. Therefore, the Company expects that it may need additional capital to continue to fund its operations. The aforementioned indicators raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including: (i) identifying access to future capital required to meet the Company’s on-going obligations, (ii) improved cashflow growth from the Company's consolidated operations, particularly in New Jersey and most recently Maryland with conversion to adult use sales, and (iii) various cost and efficiency improvements. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022 contained in the Company's 2022 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 2 of the summary of significant accounting policies of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 in the Company's 2022 Form 10-K other than the new estimate disclosed in Note 3 of the financial statements. 6 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) The Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (“VOE”) or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). As a part of the TSX listing, the Company reorganized its ownership in subsidiaries to segregate the Company’s Canadian cannabis operations from its operations in the United States and amended its share structure at TerrAscend (the ""Reorganization""). After the Reorganization, the Company owns 95 % of its Canadian business. The Company continues to consolidate both its Canadian and its U.S. cannabis operation under two different consolidation models. Subsequent to the Reorganization, all operations in the United States have a functional currency of USD. Canadian operations continue to have a functional currency of CAD. Voting Interest Entities A VOE is an entity in which (1) the total equity investment at risk is deemed sufficient to absorb the expected losses of the entity, (2) the at-risk equity holders, as a group, have all of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest and (3) the entity is structured with substantive voting rights. The Company consolidates the Canadian operations under a VOE model based on the controlling financial interest obtained through common shares with substantive voting rights. Variable Interest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more characteristics of a controlling financial interest defined under the voting interest model. The Company consolidates VIE when it has a variable interest that provide it with (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (power) and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE (benefits). As a result of the Company's TSX listing effort, TerrAscend Growth Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $ 1 million of Class A shares to an investor. See Note 10 for accounting treatment of Class A shares. The Company’s ownership in Class B shares, representing 100 % of the issued and outstanding shares of TerrAscend Growth Corp., were exchanged for non-voting, non-participating exchangeable shares of TerrAscend Growth Corp. Simultaneously, the Company entered into a protection agreement with TerrAscend Growth Corp. that contains certain negative covenants that are designed to preserve the value of the non-voting shares until such time as they are converted into common shares. The Company determined TerrAscend Growth Corp. is a VIE as all the Company’s US activities continue to be conducted on behalf of the Company which has disproportionately few voting rights. After conducting an analysis of the following VIE factors; purpose and design of the VIE, the protection agreement in place, the board structure of TerrAscend Growth Corp., and substantive kick-out rights of the Class A shareholders, it was determined that the Company has the power to direct the activities of TerrAscend Growth Corp. In addition, given the structure of the Class A shares where all of the losses and substantially all of the benefits of TerrAscend Growth Corp. are absorbed by the Company, the Company consolidates as the primary beneficiary in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 810 Consolidation . Management has applied significant judgment on the decision to consolidate its VIE's based on the facts and circumstances noted above. The Company's U.S. operations are consolidated through the VIE model. Therefore, substantially all of the Company's current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities are consolidated through the VIE model. The Company's assets and liabilities that are not consolidated through the VIE model include convertible debt, derivative liability and assets and liabilities from discontinued operations. The Company also consolidates a minimal amount of assets and liabilities within Canada, see Note 21 for more information.

Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has an Employee Retention Credit (""ERC"") for qualified wages of $ 14,903 which was included in other receivables in the table above at December 31, 2022. During January 2023, the Company received $ 12,667 , pursuant to a financing agreement with a third-party lender. In exchange, the Company assigned to the lender its interests in the $ 14,903 ERC claim that was submitted during December 2022. The difference between the amount of the claim and the amount received from the lender is the employee retention credits transfer fee which is equal to 15 % of the total claim amount. The framework prescribed in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing was reviewed and management has concluded that this should be accounted for as an asset transfer with recourse. This fee is included in finance and other expenses. If the Company does not receive the ERC claim, in whole or in part, the Company is required to repay the related portion of the funds received plus interest of 10 % accrued from the date of the financing agreement through the repayment date. The Company’s obligation under the financing agreement will be satisfied upon receipt of the ERC claim or other full repayment. As of September 30, 2023, the lender has received refunds in the amount of $ 11,527 . Subsequent to quarter end, the lender has received a further $ 1,739 , and is awaiting receipt of the remaining refunds . Management has concluded that collection remains probable and no additional recourse obligation was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Trade receivables $ 24,888 $ 14,786 Less: provision for sales returns and expected credit losses ( 10,990 ) ( 10,556 ) Total trade receivables, net $ 13,898 $ 4,230 Of which Current 12,276 4,045 31-90 days 1,492 614 Over 90 days 11,120 10,127 Less: provision for sales returns and expected credit losses ( 10,990 ) ( 10,556 ) Total trade receivables, net $ 13,898 $ 4,230 The over 90 days aged balance relates mainly to one customer which was deemed uncollectible. AMMD On January 27, 2023, TerrAscend closed the acquisition of AMMD, a dispensary in Cumberland, Maryland. Under the terms of the agreement, TerrAscend acquired a 100 % equity interest in AMMD for total consideration of $ 10,000 in cash, in addition to entering into a long-term lease with the option to purchase the real estate. The cash consideration paid included repayments of indebtedness and transaction expenses on behalf of AMMD of $ 160 and $ 29 , respectively. The following table pre sents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the January 27, 2023 acquisition date and allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: Cash and cash equivalents $ 20 Inventory 303 Prepaid expense 4 Operating right of use asset 1,499 Fixed assets 416 Intangible asset 5,330 Goodwill 6,151 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 366 ) Deferred tax liability ( 1,936 ) Corporate income taxes payable ( 291 ) Operating lease liability ( 1,499 ) Net assets acquired $ 9,631 Cash 10,000 Working capital adjustment ( 369 ) Total consideration $ 9,631 8 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) The acquired intangible assets include a medical license, which is treated as a definite-lived intangible asset and amortized over a 30-year period. The consideration paid reflected the synergies, economies of scale, and workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The accounting for this acquisition has been provisionally determined at September 30, 2023. The fair value of net assets acquired, specifically with respect to inventory, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating right of use assets, lease liabilities, corporate income taxes payable, deferred tax liability, and goodwill have been determined provisionally and are subject to adjustment. Upon completion of a comprehensive valuation and finalization of the purchase price allocation, the amounts above may be adjusted retrospectively to the acquisition date in future reporting periods. A n adjustment was made to decrease intangible assets of $ nil for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and of $ 620 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to new information regarding the fair value at January 27, 2023. This resulted in an increase to goodwill of the same amount. Costs related to this transaction were $ 191 , including legal, accounting, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses. Of the total amount of transaction costs, $ 36 and $ 99 were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On a standalone basis, had the Company acquired the business on January 1, 2023, sales estimates would have been $ 7,956 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and net income estimates would have been $ 2,716 . Actual sales and net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 since the date of acquisition are $ 7,277 and $ 2,472 , respectively. Peninsula On June 28, 2023, the Company closed the acquisition of Peninsula, a dispensary located in Salisbury, Maryland. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired 100 % of the equity interest in Peninsula for total consideration of $ 15,394 exclusive of assumed financing obligations of $ 7,226 .

The cash consideration paid included transaction expenses and repayments of indebtedness on behalf of Peninsula of $ 290 and $ 33 , respectively. The stock consideration was subject to a statutory lock-up restriction of 6 months, and, as such, a share restriction discount was considered in determining the fair value of the closing stock payment as at the transaction date. The Company guaranteed that if within 18 months from the transaction d ate of the stock consideration, the aggregate gross proceeds resulting from the sales of the common shares plus the aggregate value of the remaining common shares is less than $ 9,000 , the Company shall pay the difference (""Peninsula contingent consideration""). The fair value of the Peninsula contingent consideration was calculated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (""Black-Scholes model""). The following table presents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the June 28, 2023 acquisition date and allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: Inventory 370 Prepaid expense 371 Operating right of use asset 1,168 Fixed assets 68 Intangible asset 21,800 Goodwill 840 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 829 ) Loans payable ( 7,226 ) Operating lease liability ( 1,168 ) Net assets acquired $ 15,394 Cash 1,234 Common shares of TerrAscend 7,857 Loans payable 3,646 Contingent consideration 2,657 Total consideration $ 15,394 9 TerrAscend Corp.

The seller then becomes the lessee and the buyer becomes the lessor. Under ASC 842 Leases , both parties must assess whether the buyer-lessor has obtained control of the asset and a sale has occurred. Through the Gage Acquisition, the Company entered into leaseback transactions on six properties of owned real estate. The Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify as a sale because control was not transferred to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company has classified the lease portion of the transaction as a finance lease and continues to depreciate the asset. During 2023, five out of six agreements were amended to remove the purchase option which qualified the transactions as a sale. As a result, the Company derecognized underlying assets of $ 8,725 and its related financial obligations in the amount of $ 10,528 , resulting in a gain of $ 1,803 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company concurrently recognized an operating right of use asset and operating lease liability of $ 10,518 for the five dispensaries.

Each debenture bears interest at a rate of 9.9 % per annum from the date of issuance, calculated and compounded semi-annually, and payable on the Maturity Date. Each holder had the option to elect to receive up to 4.95 % per annum of such interest payable in cash on a semi-annual basis. Each debenture will be convertible into common shares, at the option of the holder, at any time or times prior to the close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, at a conversion price of $ 2.01 . Holders converting their debentures will receive accrued and unpaid interest for the period from and including the date of the last interest payment date, to and including, the date of conversion. In accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging , the conversion option was bifurcated from the host instrument as the instrument's strike price is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. It was recorded at fair value, using the Black-Scholes model (Note 23).

The total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the market price of the common shares on the exercise date and the price paid by the option holder to exercise the option) related to stock options exercised is presented below: For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Exercised $ 7 $ 188 $ 558 $ 328 The fair value of the various stock options granted were estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Volatility 78.61 % - 80.16 % 77.55 % - 77.89 % Risk-free interest rate 2.85 % - 3.40 % 1.63 % - 3.51 % Expected life (years) 9.78 - 10.01 9.62 - 10.01 Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % Forfeiture rate 26.11 % 26.11 % Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company's stock price. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. treasury bond issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $ 4,587 a nd $ 6,378 , respectively.

Non-controlling interest consists mainly of the Company’s ownership minority interest in its New Jersey operations. On June 26, 2023, the Company reduced its non-controlling interest through a buy out of the minority interest in IHC Real Estate LP (Note 10). This transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the non-controlling interest was adjusted by $ 1,323 to reflect the change in the net book value ownership interest. The difference from the consideration paid of $ 7,500 is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the parent’s equity holders. The following table s ummarizes the non-controlling interest activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023: September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Opening carrying amount $ 2,374 $ 5,367 Capital distributions ( 6,966 ) ( 7,550 ) Acquisition of non-controlling interest ( 1,323 ) — Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 6,492 4,557 Ending carrying amount $ 577 $ 2,374 Parties are related if one party has the ability to control or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financing and operating decisions.

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the disallowed tax deductions for 22 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) business expenses pursuant to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), and a return to provision adjustment primarily related to the Company's New Jersey tax return filings. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 differed from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the disallowed tax deductions for business expenses pursuant to Section 280E of the Code.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of TerrAscend's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with TerrAscend's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial information and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 16, 2023, or the Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q including information with respect to TerrAscend's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth under ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's Annual Report, its actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the following discussion and analysis. Unless otherwise noted, dollar amounts in this Item 2 are in thousands of U.S. dollars. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of the financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the accompanying notes for each respective period. Overview TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated licensed operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Maryland and California, and is a cannabis retailer in Ontario, Canada with a majority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent and high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use markets. Notwithstanding the fact that various states in the U.S. have implemented medical marijuana laws or that have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. TerrAscend operates under one operating segment, which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend owns a portfolio of operating businesses and several synergistic brands including: 29 TerrAscend’s head office and registered office is located at 77 City Centre Drive, Suite 501 – East Tower, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, L5B 1M5. TerrAscend’s telephone number is 1.717.610.4165 and its website is www.terrascend.com . Information contained on or accessible through TerrAscend’s website is not a part of this Quarterly Report, and the inclusion of TerrAscend’s website address in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is an inactive textual reference only. Recent Developments Subsequent Transactions Components of Results of Operations The following discussion sets forth certain components of the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss as well as factors that impact those items. Revenue TerrAscend generates revenue from the sale of cannabis products, brands, and services to the United States and Canadian markets. Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales in the medical and legal adult use market across Canada and in several U.S. states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or adult use. Cost of sales Cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to providing cannabis products and services to TerrAscend's customers, including personnel-related expenses, the depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other overhead costs. General and administrative General and administrative (""G&A"") consists primarily of personnel costs related to finance, human resources, legal, and other administrative functions. Additionally G&A expense includes professional fees to third parties, as well as marketing expenses. In addition, G&A expense includes share-based compensation on options, restricted stock units and warrants. TerrAscend expects that G&A expense will increase in absolute dollars as the business grows. Amortization and depreciation Amortization and depreciation includes the amortization of intangible assets. Amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over the following terms: Brand intangibles- indefinite lives Indefinite useful lives Brand intangibles- definite lives 3 years Software 5 years Licenses 5-30 years 30 Customer relationships 5 years Non-compete agreements 3 years Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms: Buildings and improvements Lesser of useful life or 30 years Land Not depreciated Machinery & equipment 5-15 years Office furniture & production equipment 3-5 years Right of use assets Lease term Assets in process Not depreciated Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. TerrAscend first performs a qualitative assessment. If based on the results of a qualitative assessment it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, an additional quantitative impairment test is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, TerrAscend performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration As a result of some of its acquisitions, TerrAscend recognizes a contingent consideration payable, which is an obligation to transfer additional assets to the seller if future events occur. The liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period to determine its fair value. A gain or loss is recognized in the other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a result of the revaluation. Loss (gain) on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset The Company's warrant liability consists of the warrant liability acquired through its Gage Acquisition, a detachable warrant liability issued through the private placement (Note 13), and a conversion option related to the convertible debenture offering (Note 12). These warrants were recorded as a warrant liability and are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting unit using the Black-Scholes model. A gain or loss is recognized in the other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a result of the revaluation. Finance and other expenses Finance and other expenses consists primarily of interest expense on TerrAscend's outstanding debt obligations. Transaction and restructuring costs Transaction costs include costs incurred in connection with TerrAscend's acquisitions, such as expenses related to professional fees, consulting, legal and accounting. Restructuring costs are those costs associated with severance and restructuring of business units. Impairment of property and equipment TerrAscend evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When TerrAscend determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying 31 value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gain) loss Unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gain) loss represents the loss recognized on the remeasurement of USD denominated cash and other assets recorded in the Canadian dollars functional currency at TerrAscend's Canadian operations. Unrealized and realized loss (gain) on investments TerrAscend accounts for its investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a valuation technique which maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs, with subsequent holding changes in fair value recognized in unrealized gain or loss on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes Provision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which TerrAscend conducts business.

Loss (gain) on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Loss (gain) on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative assets $ 3,217 $ (5,497 ) $ change $ 8,714 % change -159 % The warrant liability was remeasured to fair value at September 30, 2023 using the Black-Scholes model. The Company recognized a loss of $3,217 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the rising share price from June 30, 2023, as compared to September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a gain on fair value warrants of $5,497 as a result of the reduction of the Company's share price from June 30, 2022, as compared to September 30, 2022.

The Company recognized a gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as a result of the reduction of the Company's share price from December 31, 2021 as compared to September 30, 2022, as well as from warrants exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $59,373. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the purchase option derivative asset related to the option to purchase an additional 6.25% of ownership of the Company's New Jersey partnership, were remeasured using the Monte Carlo simulation model and resulted in a loss of $818. Finance and other expenses For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Finance and other expenses $ 28,341 $ 29,563 $ change $ (1,222 ) % change -4 % The decrease of $1,222 in finance and other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is primarily due to a loss recorded from the indemnification asset release related to the acquisition of Apothecarium during nine months ended September 30, 2022. Transaction and restructuring costs For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Transaction and restructuring costs $ 392 $ 1,585 $ change $ (1,193 ) % change -75 % The decrease of $1,193 in transaction and restructering costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 relates primarily to the Gage Acquisition, which closed on March 10, 2022. 36 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gain) loss For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gain) loss $ (175 ) $ 624 $ change $ (799 ) % change -128 % The change in unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss from a loss of $624 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to a gain of $175 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was a result of the Company's subsidiary TerrAscend Growth Corp, changing its functional currency to U.S. dollars from Canadian dollars in July 2023. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 32,655 $ (25,602 ) $ change $ 58,257 % change -228 % The change in provision for (benefit from) income taxes from a $25,602 benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes of $32,655 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the decrease in pre-tax loss for 2023 as a result of the impairment of Gage Growth Corp in 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ $ Cash and cash equivalents 25,410 26,158 Restricted Cash 606 605 Current assets 107,214 121,993 Non-current assets 627,452 579,594 Current liabilities 146,380 137,905 Non-current liabilities 303,504 242,511 Working capital (39,166 ) (15,912 ) Total shareholders' equity 284,782 321,171 The calculation of working capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. TerrAscend defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP. Liquidity and going concern At September 30, 2023, TerrAscend had an accumulated deficit of $662,075. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, TerrAscend incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $8,439 and $40,472, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023 the Company’s current liabilities exceed its current assets. Therefore, it is possible that the Company may need additional capital to continue to fund its operations. The aforementioned indicators raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including: (i) identifying access to future capital required to meet the Company’s on-going obligations, (ii) improved cashflow growth from TerrAscend's consolidated operations, particularly in New Jersey and most recently Maryland with conversion to adult use sales, and (iii) various cost and efficiency improvements. Since its inception, TerrAscend's primary sources of capital have been through the issuance of equity securities or debt facilities, and TerrAscend has received aggregate net proceeds from such transactions totaling $654,250 as of September 30, 2023. 37 TerrAscend expects to fund any additional future requirements through the following sources of capital: Capital requirements The Company has $208,874 in principal amounts of loans payable at September 30, 2023. Of this amount, $18,448 are due within the next twelve months. TerrAscend has entered into leases for certain premises and offices for which it owes monthly lease payments. TerrAscend has $99,003 in lease obligations. Of this amount, $9,948 are due in the next twelve months. Additionally, TerrAscend makes monthly payments on financing obligations on one of its real estate properties with $971 payable, $181 of which is due in the next twelve months. TerrAscend's undiscounted contingent consideration payable is $6,446 at September 30, 2023. The contingent consideration payable relates to TerrAscend's business acquisitions of the Apothecarium, State Flower, and Peninsula. Those payments are due in the next twelve months, with the exception of Peninsula. During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend expensed $7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses. The final payment of $3,750 was made in July 2023. At September 30, 2023, the Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $51,032 and corporate income taxes payable of $58,707. TerrAscend does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on TerrAscend's results of operations or financial condition, including and without limitation, such consideration as liquidity and capital resources. TerrAscend intends to meet its capital commitments through any or all of the sources of capital noted above. TerrAscend's objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance future obligations. Debt facilities Ilera Term Loan On December 18, 2020, WDB Holding PA, a subsidiary of TerrAscend, entered into a senior secured term loan with a syndicate of lenders in the amount of $120,000 (""Ilera Term Loan""). The term loan bears interest at 12.875% per annum and matures on December 17, 2024. TerrAscend has the ability to increase the facility by up to $30,000. WDB Holding PA's obligation under the Ilera Term Loan and related transaction documents are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of WDB Holding PA, and secured by TerrAscend USA Inc.'s equity interest in WDB Holding PA and substantially all of the assets of WDB Holding PA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto. The loan can be refinanced at the option of the borrower after 18 months from the closing date subject to a premium payment due. Of the total proceeds received, $105,767 was used to satisfy the remaining Ilera earn-out payments. On April 28, 2022, the Ilera Term Loan was amended to provide WDB Holding PA with greater flexibility by resetting the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio levels that must be satisfied at the end of each measurement period and extending the date in which WDB Holding PA is required to deliver its budget for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. In addition, the no-call period was extended from 18 months to 30 months, subject to a premium payment. This modification was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On November 11, 2022, WDB Holding PA, TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors party to the Ilera Term Loan and the PA Agent (on behalf of the required lenders) entered into an amendment to the PA Credit Agreement, pursuant to which PA Agent and the required lenders agreed that WDB Holding PA's obligation to maintain the consolidated interest coverage ratio as set 38 forth in the PA Credit Agreement for the period ended September 30, 2022, shall not apply, subject to certain conditions, including (but not limited to) an obligation to enter into a subsequent amendment agreement on or before December 15, 2022, documenting certain enhancements and amendments to the PA Credit Agreement to be agreed. In addition, WDB Holding PA offered a prepayment of $5,000 pro rata to all lenders holding outstanding loans thereunder at a price equal to 103.22% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On December 21, 2022, WDB Holding PA completed an amendment to reduce TerrAscend's principal debt by $35,000 and annual interest expense by $5,000. TerrAscend agreed to make a $35,000 payment at the original prepayment price of 103.22% to par, and agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to add certain collateral to Ilera Term Loan, collectively by March 15, 2023. The amendment further provided that should WDB Holding PA not maintain the prescribed interest coverage ratio, the Company shall be required to deposit funds, as outlined in the amendment, into a restricted account, and no event of default shall occur. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On March 15, 2023, WDB Holding PA, in exchange for a fee in the amount of 1% of the then outstanding principal loan balance, agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the obligation date to prepay TerrAscend's debt from March 15, 2023 to June 30, 2023 in which WDB Holding PA must use commercially reasonable efforts to add additional collateral to the Ilera Term Loan, (ii) increase the amount of debt to be reduced by up to $37,000, subject to certain reductions in amount based on meeting certain time based milestones, at a prepayment price of 103.22% to par, and (iii) extend the next test date in respect of the interest coverage ratio until June 30, 2023. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On April 14, 2023, WDB Holding PA agreed to an amendment to the Ilera Term Loan to, among other things, to (i) permit changes necessary for the TSX Transaction (as defined therein), and (ii) to waive certain tax provisions. On June 8, June 15, and June 29, 2023, WBD Holding PA made repayments of principal in the amounts of $7,896, $442, and $28,236, respectively. On June 22, 2023, WDB Holding PA further agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the next test date for the interest coverage ratio from June 30, 2023 to September 30, 2023, and (ii) amend the terms for which WDB Holding PA may incur certain indebtedness and liens. There is $78,427 of principal amounts outstanding at September 30, 2023. On October 2, 2023, TerrAscend completed a prepayment of the Ilera Term Loan of $1,500 at the original prepayment price of 103.22% to par. Gage Loans The Gage Acquisition included a senior secured term loan (the ""Original Gage Term Loan"") with an acquisition date fair value of $53,857. The credit agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate plus 7% or (ii) 10.25%. The term loan is payable monthly and matures on November 30, 2022. The term loan is secured by a first lien on all Gage assets. On August 10, 2022, the Original Gage Term Loan was amended as a result of the corporate restructure in conjunction with the Gage Acquisition. The amendment to the Original Gage Term Loan includes the addition of a borrower and guarantor under the term loan and a right of first offer in favor of the administrative agent for a refinancing of the term loan. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On November 29, 2022, TerrAscend Growth Corp. repaid $30,000 outstanding principal amount on the Original Gage Term Loan. On November 30, 2022, the remaining loan principal amount of $25,000 on the Original Gage Term Loan was amended (the ""Amended Gage Term Loan""). The Amended Gage Term Loan bears interest on $25,000 at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the U.S. ""prime rate"" plus 6.00%, and (ii) 13.0% and matures on November 1, 2024. Commencing on May 31, 2023, TerrAscend Growth Corp will make monthly principal repayments of 0.40% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Additionally, the unpaid principal amount of the loan shall bear paid in kind interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum. No prepayment fees are owed if TerrAscend Growth Corp voluntarily prepays the loan after 18 months. If such prepayment occurs prior to 18 months, a prepayment fee equal to all of the interest on the loans that would be due after the date of such prepayment, is owed. Under the Amended Gage Term Loan, TerrAscend has the ability to borrow incremental term loans of $30,000 at the option of TerrAscend and subject to consents from the required lenders. The additional $30,000 incremental term loans available under the amendment have not been drawn as of December 31, 2022. This loan represents a loan syndication, and therefore TerrAscend assessed each of the lenders separately under ASC 470 Debt to determine if this represents a modification, or an extinguishment of debt. For three of the four remaining lenders, it was determined that this was a modification. For the remaining lender, it was determined that this represented an extinguishment of debt and therefore the fees paid to the lenders on modification were expensed. As a result of this transaction, TerrAscend expensed $1,907 of fees paid to the lenders and third parties as they did not meet the criteria for capitalization under ASC 470 Debt . 39 Additionally, the Gage Acquisition included a loan payable to a former owner of a licensed entity with an acquisition date fair value of $2,683, and a promissory note with an acquisition date fair value of $4,065. The loan payable to the former owner bears interest at a rate of 0.2%. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 6%. There is $2,979 of principal amounts outstanding at September 30, 2023 on the loan payable and promissory note. On June 9, 2023, TerrAscend Growth Corp. agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) permit changes necessary for the TSX Transaction (as defined therein) and (ii) to permit certain indebtedness and waive certain tax provisions. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt. Pinnacle Loans The Pinnacle Acquisition purchase price included two promissory notes in an aggregate amount of $10,000 to pay down all Pinnacle liabilities and encumbrances. The promissory note matures on June 30, 2023 and bears interest rates of 6%.

The Pelorus Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate tied to the one month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), subject to a base rate, plus 9.5%, with interest-only payments for the first 36 months. The base rate is defined as, on any day, the greatest of (i) 2.5%, (b) the effective federal funds rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%, and (c) one month SOFR in effect on such day. The obligations of the borrowers under the Pelorus Term Loan are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and certain other subsidiaries of TerrAscend and secured by all of the assets of TerrAscend's Maryland and New Jersey businesses, including certain real estate in Maryland and New Jersey, but excludes all MD dispensaries.

On April 17, 2023, TerrAscend NJ, LLC agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) permit changes necessary for the TSX Transaction (as defined therein), and (ii) to waive certain tax provisions. On June 22, 2023, TerrAscend NJ, LLC further agreed to an amendment to permit certain indebtedness. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt. Stearns Loan On June 26, 2023, the Company closed on a $25,000 commercial loan with Stearns Bank, secured by the Company's cultivation facility in Pennsylvania and its AMMD dispensary in Cumberland, Maryland. The Company was required to hold $5,000 on deposit in a restricted account, of which $2,500 of the restricted cash was released on July 28, 2023 upon meeting certain criteria pursuant to the terms of the Stearns Loan. The loan carries an interest rate of prime plus 2.25% and matures in December 2024. The proceeds from the loan were used to pay down the Company's higher interest rate debt, thereby lowering the Company's overall interest expense.

Cash Flows Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 18,052 $ (33,431 ) The increase of $51,483 in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2022 is due primarily to an increase in income from operations, lower interest, reduced tax payments, partially offset by an increase in working capital. Cash flows used in investing activities For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Net cash used in investing activities $ (13,292 ) $ (12,582 ) The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to the cash paid for the acquisition of four dispensaries in Maryland.

The Company also paid the success fee of $3,750 related to Alternative Treatment Center licenses issued by the New Jersey Department of Health during nine months ended September 30, 2023. These investments were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the Company's Canadian facility of $14,285. In comparison, the net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily relates to investments in property and equipment of $24,678, related to the buildout of a cultivation site in Maryland, continuing renovations at the Company's Pennsylvania cultivation site, as well as the continued buildout of the Company's Lodi alternative treatment center in New Jersey. Additionally, the Company had investments in intangible assets of $1,330, primarily related to adult use licenses in New Jersey.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, TerrAscend reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. TerrAscend believes that certain investors and analysts use these metrics to measure a company’s ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and TerrAscend calculates (i) Adjusted gross profit as gross profit from continuing operations adjusted for certain material non-cash items, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as EBITDA from continuing operations adjusted for certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments which management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. TerrAscend believes Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful performance measure to assess the performance of TerrAscend as it provides more meaningful ongoing operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of TerrAscend’s underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. The table below reconciles net loss to 42 EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended Notes September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Net loss $ (8,671 ) $ (310,985 ) $ (44,916 ) $ (312,829 ) Loss from discontinued operations 232 10,424 4,444 15,377 Loss from continuing operations (8,439 ) (300,561 ) (40,472 ) (297,452 ) Add (deduct) the impact of: Provision for income taxes 13,543 (34,033 ) 32,655 (25,602 ) Finance expenses 10,203 10,347 26,041 25,759 Amortization and depreciation 5,417 6,560 15,179 17,578 EBITDA from continuing operations (a) 20,724 (317,687 ) 33,403 (279,717 ) Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) — 415 — 2,770 Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) — — — 5,894 Vape recall (d) — — — 2,965 Share-based compensation (e) 1,775 2,705 5,469 10,524 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (f) — 331,242 — 331,242 (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration (g) (645 ) 36 (645 ) 189 Other one-time items (h) 998 1,311 5,287 4,209 Employee Retention Credits Transfer Fee (i) — — 2,236 — Loss on lease termination and derecognition of ROU asset (j) — — 205 — Loss (gain) on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset (k) 3,217 (5,497 ) 2,564 (58,555 ) Indemnification asset release (l) — — — 3,973 Impairment of property and equipment (m) — (81 ) 345 848 Gain on disposal of fixed assets (n) (1,879 ) — (1,879 ) — Unrealized and realized loss (gain) on investments (o) 5 (231 ) 2,365 3 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gain) loss (p) (43 ) 583 (175 ) 624 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations $ 24,152 12,796 $ 49,175 $ 24,969 TerrAscend calculates adjusted gross profit by adjusting gross profit for the one-time relief of fair value of inventory upon acquisition, non-cash write downs of inventory, vape recall, and other one-time adjustments to gross profit as TerrAscend does not believe that these impacts are reflective of ongoing operations. The table below reconciles gross profit to adjusted gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended Notes September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Gross profit $ 47,805 $ 31,131 $ 117,931 $ 70,706 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) — 415 — 2,770 Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) — — — 5,894 Vape recall (d) — — — 2,965 Other one time adjustments to gross profit (q) — — 94 238 Adjusted gross profit $ 47,805 $ 31,546 $ 118,025 $ 82,573 43 The increase in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to implementation of adult use sales in New Jersey and Maryland along with the reduction of general and administrative expenses. Critical Accounting Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company's future financial statements will be affected. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates from the information provided in Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,"" other than the significant judgment relating to variable interest entities. Variable interest entities Management has applied significant judgment on the decision to consolidate its variable interest entity (“VIE”), TerrAscend Growth Corp.. The Company consolidates VIE when it has a variable interest that provide it with (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (power) and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE (benefits). Key areas of judgment related to the assessment of the purpose and design of the VIE, the protection agreement in place, the board structure of TerrAscend Growth Corp., and substantive kick-out rights of the Class A shareholders. 44 Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that the Company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of its initial public offering, (b) in which the Company has total annual gross revenue of $1,235,000 or more, or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the Company's Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000 as of the last business day of the Company's most recent second fiscal quarter; and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1,000,000 in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company's primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. In the ordinary course of business, TerrAscend is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend's consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. At September 30, 2023, there were no pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of TerrAscend's consolidated financial statements. 45 Item 1A . Risk Factors. Investing in the Company's common shares involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described in Part I, Item 1.A. “Risk Factors” in the Company's Annual Report. The Company may disclose changes to risk factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in its future filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may impair its business operations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. On August 2, 2023, TerrAscend closed a private placement of approximately 250,000 senior unsecured convertible debentures at a price of $1,000 per debenture for total gross proceeds of approximately $250,000. Unless repaid or converted earlier, the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the debentures will be due and payable 36 months following the closing of the debenture offering (the “Maturity Date”). Each debenture will bear interest at a rate of 9.9% per annum from the date of issuance, calculated and compounded semi-annually, and payable on the Maturity Date. Each holder may, at the option of the holder upon signing of the subscription agreement, elect to receive up to 4.95% per annum of such interest payable in cash on a semi-annual basis. Each debenture will be convertible into common shares, at the option of the holder, at any time or times prior to the close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, at a conversion price of $2.01. Holders converting their debentures will receive accrued and unpaid interest for the period from and including the date of the last interest payment date, to and including, the date of conversion. In connection with the terms of this debenture offering, TerrAscend agreed to make certain cash commission payments equal to an average rate of approximately 1% of the gross proceeds received by it based on the source of funds. The securities issued in the private placement described above were offered and sold in reliance upon (i) the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof and (ii) exemptions from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61–101 contained in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61–101 in respect of the Insider Participation as the fair market value (as determined under MI 61-101) of the Insider Participation in the private placement is below 25% of TerrAscend’s market capitalization (as determined in accordance with MI 61-101). Item 3 . Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4 . Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5.

Exhibits 42 Signatures 45 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that TerrAscend Corp. (""TerrAscend"" or the ""Company"") believes are, or may be considered to be, “forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding the prospects of TerrAscend’s industry or TerrAscend’s prospects, plans, financial position or business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""can"", “expect”, “likely”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “potential”, “proposed”, “estimate” and other similar words, including negative and grammatical variations thereof, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” happen, or by discussions of strategy. Forward-looking statements include estimates, plans, expectations, opinions, forecasts, projections, targets, guidance, or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: Certain of the forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and the general expectations of TerrAscend concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by TerrAscend using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry. Such data is inherently imprecise. The cannabis industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors, which factors are described further below. With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, TerrAscend has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which TerrAscend operates; (iii) the output from TerrAscend’s operations; (iv) consumer interest in TerrAscend’s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of TerrAscend’s activities and products and in the areas of taxation and environmental protection; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) TerrAscend’s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; (x) TerrAscend’s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner; and (xi) the Company’s construction plans and timeframe for completion of such plans. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of TerrAscend, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States (""U.S."") relating to cannabis operations in the U.S.; and those discussed under Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 16, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The purpose of forward-looking statements is to provide the reader with a description of management’s expectations, and such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for any other purpose. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. TerrAscend can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on the date such forward-looking statements are made. TerrAscend undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, estimates or opinions, future events or results or otherwise or to explain any material difference between subsequent actual events and such forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) 1. Na ture of operations TerrAscend Corp. (“TerrAscend” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act on March 7, 2017 . TerrAscend provides cannabis products, brands, and services to the United States (“U.S.”) and Canadian cannabinoid markets where cannabis production or consumption has been legalized for therapeutic or adult use. TerrAscend operates a number of synergistic businesses, including Gage Growth (""Gage""), a cultivator, processor and retailer in Michigan; KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings LLC (collectively ""Pinnacle""); The Apothecarium (“The Apothecarium”), a cannabis dispensary with several retail locations in California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; TerrAscend NJ, LLC (""TerrAscend NJ""), a cultivator, processor and retailer with operations in New Jersey; Ilera Healthcare (“Ilera”), Pennsylvania’s medical cannabis cultivator, processor and dispenser; vertically integrated operations in Maryland which include HMS Health, LLC and HMS Processing, LLC (collectively “HMS”), a cannabis cultivator and process or, Allegany Medical Marijuana Dispensary (""AMMD""), Peninsula Alternative Health (""Peninsula""), Blue Ridge Wellness (""Blue Ridge""), and Herbiculture Inc. (""Herbiculture""); Valhalla Confections, a cannabis-infused edibles brand; and State Flower, a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Francisco. Notwithstanding various states in the U.S. which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Effective July 4, 2023, the Company commenced trading of its common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX""), under the ticker symbol ""TSND"". Previously from May 3, 2017 to June 30, 2023, common shares of the Company were traded on the Canadian Securities Exchange under ticker symbol ""TER"". The common shares of the Company began trading on OTCQX on October 22, 2018 under the ticker symbol ""TRSSF"" and changed its ticker symbol to ""TSNDF"" effective July 6, 2023. The Company’s registered office is loc ated at 77 City Centre Drive, Suite 501, Mississauga, Ontario, L5B 1M5. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) of the Company and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and operating results. The results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023, or any other interim or future periods. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value as described herein. At June 30, 2023, TerrAscend had an accumulated deficit of $ 653,623 . During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, TerrAscend incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $ 12,855 and $ 32,033 , respectively. Additionally, as of June 30, 2023 the Company’s current liabilities exceed its current assets. Therefore, the Company expects that it will need additional capital to continue to fund its operations. The aforementioned indicators raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including: (i) identifying access to future capital required to meet the Company’s on-going obligations, (ii) improved cashflow growth from the Company's consolidated operations, particularly in New Jersey and most recently Maryland with conversion to adult use sales, and (iii) various cost and efficiency improvements. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022 contained in the Company's 2022 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 2 of the summary of significant accounting policies of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 in the Company's 2022 Form 10-K other than the new estimate disclosed in Note 3 of the financial statements. 7 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) The Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (“VOE”) or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). As a part of the TSX listing, the Company reorganized its ownership in subsidiaries to segregate the Company’s Canadian cannabis operations from its operations in the United States (the ""Reorganization""). After the Reorganization, the Company owns 95 % of its Canadian business. The Company continues to consolidate both its Canadian and its U.S. cannabis operation under two different consolidation models. Voting Interest Entities A VOE is an entity in which (1) the total equity investment at risk is deemed sufficient to absorb the expected losses of the entity, (2) the at-risk equity holders, as a group, have all of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest and (3) the entity is structured with substantive voting rights. The Company consolidates the Canadian operations under a VOE model based on the controlling financial interest obtained through common shares with substantive voting rights. Variable Interest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more characteristics of a controlling financial interest defined under the voting interest model. The Company consolidates VIE when it has a variable interest that provide it with (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (power) and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE (benefits). As a result of the Company's TSX listing effort, TerrAscend Growth Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has issued $ 1 million of Class A shares to an investor. See Note 10 for accounting treatment of Class A shares. The Company’s ownership in Class B shares, representing 100 % of the issued and outstanding shares of TerrAscend Growth Corp., were exchanged for non-voting, non-participating exchangeable shares of TerrAscend Growth Corp. Simultaneously, the Company entered into a protection agreement with TerrAscend Growth Corp. that contains certain negative covenants that are designed to preserve the value of the non-voting shares until such time as they are converted into common shares. The Company determined TerrAscend Growth Corp. is a VIE as all the Company’s US activities continue to be conducted on behalf of the Company which has disproportionately few voting rights. After conducting an analysis of the following VIE factors; purpose and design of the VIE, the protection agreement in place, the board structure of TerrAscend Growth Corp., and substantive kick-out rights of the Class A shareholders, it was determined that the Company has the power to direct the activities of TerrAscend Growth Corp. In addition, given the structure of the Class A shares where all of the losses and substantially all of the benefits of TerrAscend Growth Corp. are absorbed by the Company, the Company consolidates as the primary beneficiary in accordance with ASC 810 Consolidation . Management has applied significant judgment on the decision to consolidate its VIE's based on the facts and circumstances noted above. The Company's U.S. operations are consolidated through the VIE model. Therefore, substantially all of the Company's current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities are consolidated through the VIE model.

The seller then becomes the lessee and the buyer becomes the lessor. Under ASC 842, Leases , both parties must assess whether the buyer-lessor has obtained control of the asset and a sale has occurred. Through the Gage Acquisition, the Company entered into leaseback transactions on six properties of owned real estate. The Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify as a sale because control was not transferred to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company has classified the lease portion of the transaction as a finance lease and continues to depreciate the asset. The Gage acquisition included financing obligations . The balance at June 30, 2023 was $ 11,614 . Of this amount, $ 860 is included in other current liabilities and $ 10,754 is included in financing obligations in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The financing obligations had a weighted average term and weighted average discount rate of 7.2 years and 9.6 %, respectively, at June 30, 2023.

Unless repaid or converted earlier, the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the debentures will be due and payable 36 months following the closing of the debenture Offering (the “Maturity Date”). Each debenture will bear interest at a rate of 9.9 % per annum from the date of issuance, calculated and compounded semi-annually, and payable on the Maturity Date. Each holder may, at the option of the holder upon signing of the subscription agreement, elect to receive up to 4.95 % per annum of such interest payable in cash on a semi-annual basis.

Holders converting their debentures will receive accrued and unpaid interest for the period from and including the date of the last interest payment date, to and including, the date of conversion. In accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging , the conversion option was bifurcated from the host instrument as the instrument's strike price is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. It was recorded at fair value, using the Black-Scholes option model (Note 23). The proceeds are allocated first to the conversion option based on its fair value of $ 3,533 , and the residual was allocated to the host instrument and recorded as convertible debt at a fair value of $ 6,572 .

The total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the market price of the Company’s common shares on the exercise date and the price paid by the option holder to exercise the option) related to stock options exercised is presented below: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Exercised — $ 79 $ 551 $ 140 20 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) The fair value of the various stock options granted were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Volatility 80.04 % - 80.16 % 77.55 % - 77.89 % Risk-free interest rate 2.85 % - 3.21 % 1.63 % - 3.51 % Expected life (years) 10.01 9.62 - 10.01 Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % Forfeiture rate 26.11 % 26.11 % Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company's stock price. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. treasury bond issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $ 5,563 and $ 9,140 , respectively. As of June 30, 2023, there was $ 23,572 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options. Restricted Share Units The following table summarizes the activities for the RSUs for th e three and six months ended June 30, 2023: Number of RSUs Number of RSUs vested Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) Outstanding, December 31, 2022 415,640 13,050 N/A Granted 1,785,092 — — Vested ( 113,640 ) — — Forfeited ( 78,634 ) — — Outstanding, June 30, 2023 2,008,458 14,564 N/A As of June 30, 2023, there was $ 3,129 of total unrecognized com pensation cost related to unvested RSUs.

On June 26, 2023, the Company reduced its non-controlling interest through a buy out of the minority interest in IHC Real Estate LP (Note 10). The following table s ummarizes the non-controlling interest activity for the six months ended June 30, 2023: June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Opening carrying amount $ 2,374 $ 5,367 Capital distributions ( 3,415 ) ( 7,550 ) Transfer of minority interest ( 1,323 ) - Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 4,330 4,557 Ending carrying amount $ 1,966 $ 2,374 This transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the non-controlling interest was adjusted by $ 1,323 to reflect the change in the net book value ownership interest. The difference from the consideration paid of $ 7,500 is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the parent’s equity holders. 21 TerrAscend Corp.

Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) The Company's warrant liability consists of the warrant liability acquired through its Gage Acquisition (""Gage Warrant Liability""), a detachable warrant liability issued through the private placement (Note 13), and a conversion option related to the convertible debenture offering (Note 12). Series A, B, C, and D convertible preferred stock issued through its 2020 private placements have expired during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The Gage Warrant Liability has been remeasured to fair value. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were as follows: June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 1.52 $ 1.13 Warrant exercise price $ 8.66 $ 8.66 Annual volatility 56.3 % 97.1 %- 98.4 % Annual risk-free rate 5.5 % 4.8 % Expected term (in years) 0.5 1.0 Detachable Warrants The fair value of the detachable warrants as a part of June 2023 private placement (Note 13) was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: June 30, 2023 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 1.65 -$ 1.81 Option exercise price $ 1.95 Annual volatility 71.0 %- 71.1 % Annual risk-free rate 4.58 %- 4.66 % Expected term (in years) 1.98 - 2.00 Bifurcated conversion options The conversion option issued as a part of the June 2023 private placement (Note 12) has been measured at fair value as of June 30, 2023. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation were as follows: June 30, 2023 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 1.65 -$ 1.81 Option exercise price $ 2.01 Annual volatility 68.2 %- 68.3 % Annual risk-free rate 4.13 %- 4.25 % Expected term (in years) 2.98 - 3.00 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. At June 30, 2023 , there were no pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 25 TerrAscend Corp.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q including information with respect to TerrAscend's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth under ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report, its actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the following discussion and analysis. Unless otherwise noted, dollar amounts in this Item 2 are in thousands of U.S. dollars. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of the financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend is for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and the accompanying notes for each respective period. Overview TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated licensed operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Maryland and California, and is a cannabis retailer in Ontario, Canada with a majority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent and high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use markets. Notwithstanding the fact that various states in the U.S. have implemented medical marijuana laws or that have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. TerrAscend operates under one operating segment, which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend owns a portfolio of operating businesses and several synergistic brands including: 27 TerrAscend’s head office and registered office is located at 77 City Centre Drive, Suite 501 – East Tower, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, L5B 1M5. TerrAscend’s telephone number is 1.717.610.4165 and its website is www.terrascend.com .

Recent Developments Subsequent Transactions 28 Components of Results of Operations The following discussion sets forth certain components of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss as well as factors that impact those items. Revenue TerrAscend generates revenue from the sale of cannabis products, brands, and services to the United States and Canadian markets. Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales in the medical and legal adult use market across Canada and in several U.S. states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or adult use. Cost of sales Cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to providing cannabis products and services to TerrAscend's customers, including personnel-related expenses, the depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other overhead costs. General and administrative General and administrative (""G&A"") consists primarily of personnel costs related to finance, human resources, legal, and other administrative functions. Additionally G&A expense includes professional fees to third parties, as well as marketing expenses. In addition, G&A expense includes share-based compensation on options, restricted stock units and warrants. TerrAscend expects that G&A expense will increase in absolute dollars as the business grows. Amortization and depreciation Amortization and depreciation includes the amortization of intangible assets. Amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over the following terms: Brand intangibles- indefinite lives Indefinite useful lives Brand intangibles- definite lives 3 years Software 5 years Licenses 5-30 years Customer relationships 5 years Non-compete agreements 3 years Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms: Buildings and improvements Lesser of useful life or 30 years Land Not depreciated Machinery & equipment 5-15 years Office furniture & production equipment 3-5 years Right of use assets Lease term Assets in process Not depreciated Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. TerrAscend first performs a qualitative assessment. If based on the results of a qualitative assessment it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds 29 its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment test is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, TerrAscend performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration As a result of some of its acquisitions, TerrAscend recognizes a contingent consideration payable, which is an obligation to transfer additional assets to the seller if future events occur. The liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period to determine its fair value. A gain or loss is recognized in the other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a result of the revaluation. (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset The Company's warrant liability consists of the warrant liability acquired through its Gage Acquisition, a detachable warrant liability issued through the private placement (Note 13), and a conversion option related to the convertible debenture offering (Note 12). These warrants were recorded as a warrant liability and are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting unit using the Black-Scholes model. A gain or loss is recognized in the other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as a result of the revaluation. Finance and other expenses Finance and other expenses consists primarily of interest expense on TerrAscend's outstanding debt obligations. Transaction and restructuring costs Transaction costs include costs incurred in connection with TerrAscend's acquisitions, such as expenses related to professional fees, consulting, legal and accounting. Restructuring costs are those costs associated with severance and restructuring of business units. Impairment of property and equipment TerrAscend evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When TerrAscend determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss represents the loss recognized on the remeasurement of USD denominated cash and other assets recorded in the Canadian dollars functional currency at TerrAscend's Canadian operations. Unrealized and realized gain on investments TerrAscend accounts for its investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a valuation technique which maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs, with subsequent holding changes in fair value recognized in unrealized gain or loss on investments in the consolidated statement of loss. Provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which TerrAscend conducts business. Results from Operations- Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 The following tables represent the Company’s results from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Revenue, net 30 For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Revenue $ 72,437 $ 64,221 Excise and cultivation taxes (313 ) (261 ) Revenue, net $ 72,124 $ 63,960 $ change $ 8,164 % change 13 % Revenue increased from $63,960 to $72,124 driven by growth in retail offset by a decline in wholesale. Retail revenue increased from $47,979 during the three months ended June 30, 2022 to $58,254 during the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase is primarily a result of adult use coming online in New Jersey in April 2022 and the acquisition of AMMD in Maryland in January 2023. The increase in retail revenue is partially offset by a $2,111 decrease in wholesale revenue related to declines in wholesale in the Pennsylvania market offset by growth in the wholesale market in New Jersey related to adult use sales in the state. Cost of Sales For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Cost of sales $ 34,817 $ 32,587 Impairment and write downs of inventory 1,081 7,422 Total cost of sales $ 35,898 $ 40,009 $ change $ (4,111 ) % change -10 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 50 % 63 % The reduction of $4,111 in cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 is mainly a result of impairments and write-downs of inventory in Pennsylvania of $7,422 in the prior period. General and Administrative Expense For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 General and administrative expense $ 30,476 $ 32,925 $ change $ (2,449 ) % change -7 % The decline in G&A expense of $2,449 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily a result of actions the Company undertook in the latter part of 2022 to reduce expenses and reduce its workforce in order to strengthen the position for the Company to generate positive cashflow from operations. Amortization and Depreciation Expense For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Amortization and depreciation $ 2,242 $ 2,581 $ change $ (339 ) % change -13 % The decrease of $339 in amortization and depreciation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 is primarily due to a brand intangible asset that was fully amortized during 2022. Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset $ (215 ) $ (47,345 ) $ change $ 47,130 % change -100 % The Preferred Share warrant liability was remeasured to fair value at June 30, 2022 using the Black-Scholes model. The Company recognized a gain during the three months ended June 30, 2022 as a result of the reduction of the Company's share price from March 31, 2022 as compared to June 30, 2022, as well as from warrants exercised during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $47,345. 31 The Preferred Share warrant liability expired during the three months ended June 30, 2023. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the purchase option derivative asset related to the option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership of the Company's New Jersey partnership, was remeasured using the Monte Carlo simulation model and resulted in a loss of $500. Finance and other expenses For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Finance and other expenses $ 8,171 $ 13,663 $ change $ (5,492 ) % change -40 % The decrease of $5,492 in finance and other expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 is primarily due to the indemnification of asset release as a result of the expiration of escrow agreement related to the acquisition of Apothecarium during the three months ended June 30, 2022. Transaction and restructuring costs For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Transaction and restructuring costs $ 389 $ 627 $ change $ (238 ) % change -38 % The decrease of $238 in transaction and restricting costs for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 relates primarily to work done for Sarbanes Oxley implementation during the three months ended June 30, 2022.

Provision for income taxes For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 6,448 $ 4,688 $ change $ 1,760 % change 38 % The increase in provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by the increase in gross profit as a result of growth in new jurisdictions. Results from Operations- Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 The following tables represent the Company’s results from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

The growth in retail was driven by the conversion to adult use in New Jersey, the acquisition of Gage in March 2022, and the acquisition of AMMD in January 2023. The decline in wholesale was driven by market dynamics in Pennsylvania and the decision the Company made to discontinue bulk wholesale in Michigan, partially offset by an increase in New Jersey driven by adult use implementation. Cost of Sales For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Cost of sales $ 70,315 $ 65,663 Impairment and write downs of inventory 1,081 7,307 Total cost of sales $ 71,396 $ 72,970 $ change $ (1,574 ) % change -2 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 50 % 65 % The reduction of $1,574 in cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 is mainly a result of impairments and write downs of inventory in Pennsylvania of $7,422 in the prior year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ $ Cash and cash equivalents 28,915 26,158 Restricted Cash 3,106 605 Current assets 106,629 121,993 Non-current assets 615,119 579,594 Current liabilities 133,489 137,905 Non-current liabilities 292,660 242,511 Working capital (26,860 ) (15,912 ) Total shareholders' equity 295,599 321,171 34 The calculation of working capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. TerrAscend defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP. Liquidity and going concern At June 30, 2023, TerrAscend had an accumulated deficit of $653,623. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, TerrAscend incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $12,855 and $32,033, respectively. Additionally, as of June 30, 2023 the Company’s current liabilities exceed its current assets. Therefore, it is possible that the Company may need additional capital to continue to fund its operations. The aforementioned indicators raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including: (i) identifying access to future capital required to meet the Company’s on-going obligations, (ii) improved cashflow growth from TerrAscend's consolidated operations, particularly in New Jersey and most recently Maryland with conversion to adult use sales, and (iii) various cost and efficiency improvements. Since its inception, TerrAscend's primary sources of capital have been through the issuance of equity securities or debt facilities, and TerrAscend has received aggregate net proceeds from such transactions totaling $654,000 as of June 30, 2023. TerrAscend expects to fund any additional future requirements through the following sources of capital: Capital requirements The Company has $208,659 in principal amounts of loans payable at June 30, 2023. Of this amount, $22,336 are due within the next twelve months. TerrAscend has entered into leases for certain premises and offices for which it owes monthly lease payments. TerrAscend has $78,204 in lease obligations. Of this amount, $6,151 are due in the next twelve months. Additionally, TerrAscend makes monthly payments on financing obligations on six of its real estate properties with $14,691 payable, $1,944 of which is due in the next twelve months. TerrAscend's undiscounted contingent consideration payable is $4,434 at June 30, 2023. The contingent consideration payable relates to TerrAscend's business acquisitions of the Apothecarium and State Flower and is due in the next twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend expensed $7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses. The final payment of $3,750 was made in July 2023. At June 30, 2023, the Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $50,841 and corporate income taxes payable of $45,934. TerrAscend does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on TerrAscend's results of operations or financial condition, including and without limitation, such consideration as liquidity and capital resources. TerrAscend intends to meet its capital commitments through any or all of the sources of capital noted above. TerrAscend's objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance future obligations. Debt facilities 35 Ilera Term Loan On December 18, 2020, WDB Holding PA, a subsidiary of TerrAscend, entered into a senior secured term loan with a syndicate of lenders in the amount of $120,000 (""Ilera Term Loan""). The term loan bears interest at 12.875% per annum and matures on December 17, 2024. TerrAscend has the ability to increase the facility by up to $30,000. WDB Holding PA's obligation under the Ilera Term Loan and related transaction documents are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of WDB Holding PA, and secured by TerrAscend USA Inc.'s equity interest in WDB Holding PA and substantially all of the assets of WDB Holding PA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto. The loan can be refinanced at the option of the borrower after 18 months from the closing date subject to a premium payment due. Of the total proceeds received, $105,767 was used to satisfy the remaining Ilera earn-out payments. On April 28, 2022, the Ilera Term Loan was amended to provide WDB Holding PA with greater flexibility by resetting the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio levels that must be satisfied at the end of each measurement period and extending the date in which WDB Holding PA is required to deliver its budget for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. In addition, the no-call period was extended from 18 months to 30 months, subject to a premium payment. This modification was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On November 11, 2022, WDB Holding PA, TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors party to the Ilera Term Loan and the PA Agent (on behalf of the required lenders) entered into an amendment to the PA Credit Agreement, pursuant to which PA Agent and the required lenders agreed that WDB Holding PA's obligation to maintain the consolidated interest coverage ratio as set forth in the PA Credit Agreement for the period ended September 30, 2022, shall not apply, subject to certain conditions, including (but not limited to) an obligation to enter into a subsequent amendment agreement on or before December 15, 2022, documenting certain enhancements and amendments to the PA Credit Agreement to be agreed. In addition, WDB Holding PA offered a prepayment of $5,000 pro rata to all lenders holding outstanding loans thereunder at a price equal to 103.22% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On December 21, 2022, WDB Holding PA completed an amendment to reduce TerrAscend's principal debt by $35,000 and annual interest expense by $5,000. TerrAscend agreed to make a $35,000 payment at the original prepayment price of 103.22% to par, and agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to add certain collateral to Ilera Term Loan, collectively by March 15, 2023. The amendment further provided that should WDB Holding PA not maintain the prescribed interest coverage ratio, the Company shall be required to deposit funds, as outlined in the amendment, into a restricted account, and no event of default shall occur. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On March 15, 2023, WDB Holding PA, in exchange for a fee in the amount of 1% of the then outstanding principal loan balance, agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the obligation date to prepay TerrAscend's debt from March 15, 2023 to June 30, 2023 in which WDB Holding PA must use commercially reasonable efforts to add additional collateral to the Ilera Term Loan, (ii) increase the amount of debt to be reduced by up to $37,000, subject to certain reductions in amount based on meeting certain time based milestones, at a prepayment price of 103.22% to par, and (iii) extend the next test date in respect of the interest coverage ratio until June 30, 2023. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . There is $115,000 of principal amounts outstanding at March 31, 2023. On April 14, 2023, WDB Holding PA agreed to an amendment to the Ilera Term Loan to, among other things, to (i) permit changes necessary for the TSX Transaction (as defined therein), and (ii) to waive certain tax provisions. On June 22, 2023, WDB Holding PA further agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the next test date for the interest coverage ratio from June 30, 2023 to September 30, 2023, and (ii) amend the terms for which WDB Holding PA may incur certain indebtedness and liens. Gage Loans The Gage Acquisition included a senior secured term loan (the ""Original Gage Term Loan"") with an acquisition date fair value of $53,857. The credit agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate plus 7% or (ii) 10.25%. The term loan is payable monthly and matures on November 30, 2022. The term loan is secured by a first lien on all Gage assets. On August 10, 2022, the Original Gage Term Loan was amended as a result of the corporate restructure in conjunction with the Gage Acquisition. The amendment to the Original Gage Term Loan includes the addition of a borrower and guarantor under the term loan and a right of first offer in favor of the administrative agent for a refinancing of the term loan. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . 36 On November 29, 2022, TerrAscend repaid $30,000 outstanding principal amount on the Original Gage Term Loan. On November 30, 2022, the remaining loan principal amount of $25,000 on the Original Gage Term Loan was amended (the ""Amended Gage Term Loan""). The Amended Gage Term Loan bears interest on $25,000 at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the U.S. ""prime rate"" plus 6.00%, and (ii) 13.0% and matures on November 1, 2024. Commencing on May 31, 2023, TerrAscend will make monthly principal repayments of 0.40% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Additionally, the unpaid principal amount of the loan shall bear paid in kind interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum. No prepayment fees are owed if TerrAscend voluntarily prepays the loan after 18 months. If such prepayment occurs prior to 18 months, a prepayment fee equal to all of the interest on the loans that would be due after the date of such prepayment, is owed. Under the Amended Gage Term Loan, TerrAscend has the ability to borrow incremental term loans of $30,000 at the option of TerrAscend and subject to consents from the required lenders. The additional $30,000 incremental term loans available under the amendment have not been drawn as of December 31, 2022. This loan represents a loan syndication, and therefore TerrAscend assessed each of the lenders separately under ASC 470 Debt to determine if this represents a modification, or an extinguishment of debt. For three of the four remaining lenders, it was determined that this was a modification. For the remaining lender, it was determined that this represented an extinguishment of debt and therefore the fees paid to the lenders on modification were expensed. As a result of this transaction, TerrAscend expensed $1,907 of fees paid to the lenders and third parties as they did not meet the criteria for capitalization under ASC 470 Debt . Additionally, the Gage Acquisition included a loan payable to a former owner of a licensed entity with an acquisition date fair value of $2,683, and a promissory note with an acquisition date fair value of $4,065. The loan payable to the former owner bears interest at a rate of 0.2%. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 6%. There is $4,583 of principal amounts outstanding at June 30, 2023 on the loan payable and promissory note. On June 9, 2023, TerrAscend Growth Corp. agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) permit changes necessary for the TSX Transaction (as defined therein) and (ii) to permit certain indebtedness and waive certain tax provisions. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt. Pinnacle Loans The Pinnacle Acquisition purchase price included two promissory notes in an aggregate amount of $10,000 to pay down all Pinnacle liabilities and encumbrances. The promissory note matures on June 30, 2023 and bears interest rates of 6%. On June 27, 2023, Spartan Partners Properties, LLC, agreed to an amendment among other things, to extend the obligation date of the loan until December 1, 2023. There is $8,833 of principal amounts outstanding at March 31, 2023 on the two promissory notes. Pelorus Term Loan On October 11, 2022, subsidiaries of TerrAscend, among others, entered into a loan agreement with Pelorus Fund REIT, LLC (""Pelorus"") for a single-draw senior secured term loan (""Pelorus Term Loan"") in an aggregate principal amount of $45,478. The Pelorus Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate tied to the one month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), subject to a base rate, plus 9.5%, with interest-only payments for the first 36 months. The base rate is defined as, on any day, the greatest of (i) 2.5%, (b) the effective federal funds rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%, and (c) one month SOFR in effect on such day. The obligations of the borrowers under the Pelorus Term Loan are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and certain other subsidiaries of TerrAscend and secured by all of the assets of TerrAscend's Maryland and New Jersey businesses, including certain real estate in Maryland and New Jersey, but excludes all MD dispensaries. The Pelorus Term Loan matures on October 11, 2027. There is $45,478 of principal amounts outstanding at June 30, 2023. On April 17, 2023, TerrAscend NJ, LLC agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) permit changes necessary for the TSX Transaction (as defined therein), and (ii) to waive certain tax provisions. On June 22, 2023, TerrAscend NJ, LLC further agreed to an amendment to permit certain indebtedness. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt. Stearns Loan On June 26, 2023, the Company closed on a $25,000 commercial loan with Stearns Bank, secured by the Company's cultivation facility in Pennsylvania and its AMMD dispensary in Cumberland, Maryland. The Company is required to hold $2,500 on deposit in a restricted account. The loan carries an interest rate of prime plus 2.25% and matures in December 2024. The proceeds from the loan were used to pay down the Company's higher interest rate debt, thereby lowering the Company's overall interest expense. 37 Class A Share of TerrAscend Growth As a part of the Reorganization (Note 3), TerrAscend Growth Corp. issued $ 1 million of Class A shares with a 20% guaranteed annual dividend. Under the Subscription Agreement, TerrAscend Growth Corp holds a call right to repurchase all of the Class A Shares, at any point in time, issuable to the holder of Class A shares and the holder of Class A shares is granted a put right that is exercisable at any time following the five-year anniversary of the closing of the investment. The instrument is considered as a debt due to the economic characteristics and risks. IHC Real Estate LP Loan On June 26, 2023, the Company bought out the minority interest in IHC Real Estate LP and entered into a promissory note of $7,500. The promissory note carries an interest rate of 15% and matures on January 15, 2024. On June 28, 2023, the Company made a payment of $1,500. Cash Flows Cash flows (used in) / provided by operating activities For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Net cash (used in) / provided by operating activities $ 9,120 $ (34,976 ) The increase of $44,096 in net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to June 30, 2022 is due primarily to lower interest of $5,832, reduced taxes of $22,127, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other payables of $11,929 due to timing of those payments, offset by an increase in inventory of $8,059. Cash flows used in investing activities For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Net cash (used in) investing activities $ (4,877 ) $ (39 ) The net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily relates to the cash paid for the acquisition of three dispensaries in Maryland. Additionally, TerrAscend increased the investment in property and equipment by $5,426 during the six months ended June 30, 2023. In comparison, the net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily relates to investments in property and equipment of $12,500 and deposits for property and equipment of $10,036, primarily related to the buildout of a cultivation site in Maryland, continuing renovations at the Company's Pennsylvania cultivation site, as well as the continued buildout of the Company's Lodi alternative treatment center in New Jersey. Additionally, the Company had investments in intangible assets of $1,330, primarily related to adult use licenses in New Jersey. The cash used in investing activities is offset by cash inflows of $24,716 related to the cash acquired through the Gage Acquisition. Cash flows provided by financing activities For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 4,416 $ 8,781 Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to cash inflow as a result of transfer with recourse of Employee Retention Credit of $12,677, net proceeds from the commercial loan with Stearns bank of $23,872, and net proceeds from private placements of $19,218, offset by loan principal paid of $40,359 and distributions to minority partners of $3,415. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, 7,989,436 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of $23,797 and 88,015 stock options were exercised for total gross proceeds of $361. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of State Flower of $6,630, loan principal payments of $5,203, loan amendment fee paid on the modification of the Ilera term loan of $1,200, and tax distributions paid on behalf of the partners of the New Jersey operations of $1,436. 38 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, TerrAscend reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. TerrAscend believes that certain investors and analysts use these metrics to measure a company’s ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and TerrAscend calculates (i) Adjusted gross profit as gross profit from continuing operations adjusted for certain material non-cash items, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as EBITDA from continuing operations adjusted for certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments which management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. TerrAscend believes Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful performance measure to assess the performance of TerrAscend as it provides more meaningful ongoing operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of TerrAscend’s underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. The table below reconciles net loss to EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended Notes June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Net loss $ (13,476 ) $ 14,162 $ (36,245 ) $ (1,844 ) Loss from discontinued operations 621 2,697 4,212 4,953 Loss from continuing operations (12,855 ) 16,859 (32,033 ) 3,109 Add (deduct) the impact of: Provision for income taxes 6,448 4,688 19,112 8,431 Finance expenses 7,963 10,315 15,838 16,920 Amortization and depreciation 4,991 6,493 9,762 11,018 EBITDA from continuing operations (a) 6,547 38,355 12,679 39,478 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) — 549 — 2,355 Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) — 5,894 — 5,894 Vape recall (d) — 1,071 — 2,965 Share-based compensation (e) 1,981 4,463 3,694 7,819 Loss from revaluation of contingent consideration (f) 34 0 153 Other one-time items (g) 2,932 924 4,290 2,898 Employee Retention Credits Transfer Fee (h) — — 2,235 — Loss on lease termination and derecognition of ROU asset (i) — — 205 — Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset (j) (215 ) (47,345 ) (653 ) (53,058 ) Indemnification asset release (k) — 3,998 — 3,973 Impairment of property and equipment and loss on disposal of fixed assets (l) 10 929 345 929 Unrealized and realized loss on investments (m) 1,661 234 2,360 234 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss (n) (101 ) (315 ) (132 ) 41 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations $ 12,815 $ 8,791 $ 25,023 $ 13,681 TerrAscend calculates adjusted gross profit by adjusting gross profit for the one-time relief of fair value of inventory upon acquisition, non-cash write downs of inventory, vape recall, and other one time adjustments to gross profit as TerrAscend does not believe that these impacts are reflective of ongoing operations. The table below reconciles gross profit to adjusted gross profit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022: 39 For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended Notes June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Gross profit $ 36,226 $ 23,951 $ 70,126 $ 39,575 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) — 549 — 2,355 Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) — 5,894 — 5,894 Vape recall (d) — 1,071 — 2,965 Other one time adjustments to gross profit (g) — — 94 238 Adjusted gross profit $ 36,226 $ 31,465 $ 70,220 $ 51,027 The increase in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to implementation of adult use sales in New Jersey. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions on an ongoing 40 basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company's future financial statements will be affected. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates from the information provided in Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,"" other than the significant judgment relating to variable interest entities. Variable interest entities Management has applied significant judgment on the decision to consolidate its variable interest entity (“VIE”), TerrAscend Growth Corp.. The Company consolidates VIE when it has a variable interest that provide it with (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (power) and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE (benefits). Key areas of judgment related to the assessment of the purpose and design of the VIE, the protection agreement in place, the board structure of TerrAscend Growth Corp., and substantive kick-out rights of the Class A shareholders. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that the Company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of its initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.235 billion or more, or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000 as of the prior June 30th; and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1,000,000 in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company's primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2023 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 41 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. In the ordinary course of business, TerrAscend is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend's consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. At June 30, 2023, there were no pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of TerrAscend's consolidated financial statements. Item 1A . Risk Factors. Investing in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described in Part I, Item 1.A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report. We may disclose changes to risk factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations. Item 2.

(""TerrAscend"" or the ""Company"") believes are, or may be considered to be, “forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding the prospects of TerrAscend’s industry or TerrAscend’s prospects, plans, financial position or business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""can"", “expect”, “likely”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “potential”, “proposed”, “estimate” and other similar words, including negative and grammatical variations thereof, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” happen, or by discussions of strategy. Forward-looking statements include estimates, plans, expectations, opinions, forecasts, projections, targets, guidance, or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: Certain of the forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and the general expectations of TerrAscend concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by TerrAscend using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry. Such data is inherently imprecise. The cannabis industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors, which factors are described further below. With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, TerrAscend has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which TerrAscend operates; (iii) the output from TerrAscend’s operations; (iv) consumer interest in TerrAscend’s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of TerrAscend’s activities and products and in the areas of taxation and environmental protection; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) TerrAscend’s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; (x) TerrAscend’s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner; and (xi) the Company’s construction plans and timeframe for completion of such plans. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of TerrAscend, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States (""U.S."") relating to cannabis operations in the U.S.; and those discussed under Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 16, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The purpose of forward-looking statements is to provide the reader with a description of management’s expectations, and such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for any other purpose. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. TerrAscend can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on the date such forward-looking statements are made.

Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) 1. Na ture of operations TerrAscend Corp. (“TerrAscend” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act on March 7, 2017 . TerrAscend provides cannabis products, brands, and services to the United States (“U.S.”) and Canadian cannabinoid markets where cannabis production or consumption has been legalized for therapeutic or adult use. TerrAscend operates a number of synergistic businesses, including Gage Growth (""Gage""), a cultivator, processor and retailer in Michigan; KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings LLC (collectively ""Pinnacle""); The Apothecarium (“The Apothecarium”), a cannabis dispensary with several retail locations in California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; TerrAscend NJ, LLC (""TerrAscend NJ""), a cultivator, processor and retailer with operations in New Jersey; Ilera Healthcare (“Ilera”), Pennsylvania’s medical cannabis cultivator, processor and dispenser; HMS Health, LLC and HMS Processing, LLC (collectively “HMS”), a medical cannabis cultivator and processor based in Maryland; Valhalla Confections, a manufacturer of cannabis-infused edibles; and State Flower, a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Franci sco. Notwithstanding various states in the U.S. which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. On January 27, 2023, the Company closed on its previously announced acquisition of Allegany Medical Marijuana Dispensary (""AMMD"") . Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired 100 % equity interest in AMMD for total consideration of $ 10,000 in cash, in addition to entering into a long-term lease with the option to purchase the real estate. The Company now operates vertically integrated licensed operations in Maryland. The Company has been listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (""CSE"") since May 3, 2017, having the ticker symbol ""TER"" and effective October 22, 2018, the Company began trading on OTCQX under the ticker symbol ""TRSSF"". The Company’s registered office is located at 77 City Centre Drive, Suite 501, Mississauga, Ontario, L5B 1M5. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) of the Company and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and operating results. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023, or any other interim or future periods. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value as described herein. At March 31, 2023, TerrAscend had an accumulated deficit of $ 641,517 . During the three months ended March 31, 2023 , TerrAscend incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $ 19,178 . Additionally, as of March 31, 2023 the Company’s current liabilities exceed its current assets. Therefore, TerrAscend expects that it will need additional capital to continue to fund its operations. The aforementioned indicators raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. TerrAscend believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including (i) identifying access to future capital, (ii) continued sales growth from TerrAscend's consolidated operations, and (iii) various actions that were implemented during the latter part of 2022 and continued during the three months ended March 31, 2023 leading to general and administrative expense reductions and other cost and efficiency improvements. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022 contained in the Company's 2022 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 2 of the summary of significant accounting policies of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 in the Company's 2022 Form 10-K other than noted below. 7 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Trade receivables $ 18,394 $ 14,786 Sales tax receivable 235 277 Other receivables 1,241 17,936 Expected credit losses ( 10,878 ) ( 10,556 ) Total receivables, net $ 8,993 $ 22,443 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has an Employee Retention Credit (""ERC"") for qualified wages of $ 14,903 which was included in other receivables in the table above at December 31, 2022. During January 2023, the Company received $ 12,667 , pursuant to a financing agreement with a third-party lender. In exchange, the Company assigned to the lender its interests in the $ 14,903 ERC claim that was submitted during December 2022. The difference between the amount of the claim and the amount received from the lender is the employee retention credits transfer fee which is equal to 15 % of the total claim amount. The framework prescribed in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing was reviewed and management has concluded that this should be accounted for as an asset transfer with recourse. This fee is included in finance and other expenses. If the Company does not receive the ERC claim, in whole or in part, the Company is required to repay the related portion of the funds received plus interest of 10 % accrued from the date of the financing agreement through the repayment date. The Company’s obligation under the financing agreement will be satisfied upon receipt of the ERC claim or other full repayment. Management has concluded that collection remains probable and no additional recourse obligation was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2023. March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Trade receivables $ 18,394 $ 14,786 Less: provision for sales returns and expected credit losses ( 10,878 ) ( 10,556 ) Total trade receivables, net $ 7,516 $ 4,230 Of which Current 6,244 4,045 31-90 days 1,009 614 Over 90 days 11,141 10,127 Less: provision for sales returns and expected credit losses ( 10,878 ) ( 10,556 ) Total trade receivables, net $ 7,516 $ 4,230 The over 90 days aged balance relates mainly to one customer which was deemed uncollectible. AMMD On January 27, 2023, TerrAscend closed on its previously announced acquisition of AMMD, a medical dispensary in Cumberland, Maryland. The acquisition adds the Company’s first retail store in Maryland and complements TerrAscend's cultivation and processing facility in Hagerstown, Maryland. Under the terms of the agreement, TerrAscend acquired a 100 % equity interest in AMMD for total consideration of $ 10,000 in cash, in addition to entering into a long-term lease with the option to purchase the real estate. The cash consideration paid included repayments of indebtedness and transaction expenses on behalf of AMMD of $ 160 and $ 29 , respectively. The following table presents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the January 27, 2023 acquisition date and allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: 8 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) $ Cash and cash equivalents 20 Inventory 303 Prepaid expense 4 Operating right of use asset 781 Fixed assets 416 Intangible asset 5,950 Goodwill 5,385 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 135 ) Deferred tax liability ( 2,021 ) Corporate income taxes payable ( 291 ) Operating lease liability ( 781 ) Net assets acquired 9,631 Cash 10,000 Working capital adjustment ( 369 ) Total consideration 9,631 The acquired intangible assets include a medical license, which is treated as a definite-lived intangible asset and amortized over a 30-year period. The consideration paid reflected the synergies, economies of scale, and workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The accounting for this acquisition has been provisionally determined at March 31, 2023. The fair value of net assets acquired, specifically with respect to inventory, intangible assets, property and equipment, operating right of use assets, lease liabilities, corporate income taxes payable, deferred tax liability, and goodwill have been determined provisionally and are subject to adjustment. Upon completion of a comprehensive valuation and finalization of the purchase price allocation, the amounts above may be adjusted retrospectively to the acquisition date in future reporting periods. Costs related to this transaction were $ 191 , including legal, accounting, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses. Of the total amount of transaction costs, $ 36 and $ 99 were r ecorded during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Contingent consideration Contingent consideration recorded relates to the Company’s business acquisitions. Contingent consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the terms of the agreement. The balance of contingent consideration is as follows: State Flower Apothecarium Pinnacle Total Carrying amount, December 31, 2022 $ 1,406 $ 3,028 $ 750 $ 5,184 Payments of contingent consideration — — ( 750 ) ( 750 ) Carrying amount, March 31, 2023 $ 1,406 $ 3,028 — $ 4,434 Less: current portion ( 1,406 ) ( 3,028 ) — ( 4,434 ) Non-current contingent consideration — — — — During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company issued 471,681 shares of common stock to the sellers of its previously acquired Pinnacle business. The issuance of shares fully settles the $ 750 earn out consideration provision in the stock purchase agreement. 9 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) The Company’s inventory of dry cannabis and oil includes both purchased and internally produced inventory. The Company’s inventory is comprised of the following items: March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Raw materials $ 1,664 $ 1,181 Finished goods 16,500 15,280 Work in process 28,724 26,406 Accessories, supplies and consumables 3,922 3,468 $ 50,810 $ 46,335 The company wrote off $ 797 of packaging inventory due primarily to defective cartridges during the three months ended March 31, 2023. On February 4, 2022, more than 500 vape products were recalled by the Pennsylvania's Department of Health, including several of the Company's SKUs. As a result of the recall, the Company wrote off $ 854 of inventory during the three months ended March 31,2022. In addition, management impaired its inventory by $ 219 as it was deemed unsaleable. The Company determined to make available for sale the asset groups related to TerrAscend Canada's Licensed Producer business. As a result, the results of operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. The major classes of assets and liabilities from discontinued operations included the following: March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Land $ 734 $ 734 Buildings & improvements 13,460 16,529 Office furniture & equipment 72 86 Total assets held for sale $ 14,266 $ 17,349 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 525 571 Current assets from discontinued operations $ 525 $ 571 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 2,082 $ 3,747 Loans payable 5,386 5,364 Current liabilities from discontinued operations $ 7,468 $ 9,111 The results of operations for the discontinued operations includes revenues and expenses directly attributable to the operations disposed. Corporate and administrative expenses, including interest expense, not directly attributable to the operations were not allocated to TerrAscend Canada's Licensed Producer business. The results of discontinued operations were as follows: 10 TerrAscend Corp.

Through the Gage Acquisition, the Company entered into leaseback transactions on six properties of owned real estate. The Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify as a sale because control was not transferred to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company has classified the lease portion of the transaction as a finance lease and continues to depreciate the asset. The Gage acquisition included financing obligations .

The total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the market price of the Company’s common stock on the exercise date and the price paid by the option holder to exercise the option) related to stock options exercised is presented below: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Exercised $ 551 $ 61 The fair value of the various stock options granted were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Volatility 80.04 % - 80.16 % 77.55 % - 77.89 % Risk-free interest rate 2.85 % - 3.21 % 1.63 % - 3.51 % Expected life (years) 10.01 9.62 - 10.01 Dividend yield 0.00 % 0.00 % Forfeiture rate 26.11 % 26.11 % 16 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for share and per share amounts) Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company's stock price. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on US treasury bond issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 4,263 and $ 2,511 , respectively. As of March 31, 2023, there was $ 24,540 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options.

TerrAscend operates under one operating segment, which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend owns a portfolio of operating businesses and several synergistic brands including: TerrAscend’s head office and registered office is located at 77 City Centre Drive, Suite 501 - East Tower, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, L5B 1M5. 23 TerrAscend’s telephone number is 1.855.837.7295 and its website is www.terrascend.com .

In addition, G&A expense includes share-based compensation on options, restricted stock units and warrants. TerrAscend expects that G&A expense will increase in absolute dollars as the business grows. Amortization and depreciation Amortization and depreciation includes the amortization of intangible assets. Amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over the following terms: Brand intangibles- indefinite lives Indefinite useful lives Brand intangibles- definite lives 3 years Software 5 years Licenses 5-30 years Customer relationships 5 years Non-compete agreements 3 years Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms: Buildings and improvements Lesser of useful life or 30 years Land Not depreciated Machinery & equipment 5-15 years Office furniture & production equipment 3-5 years Right of use assets Lease term Assets in process Not depreciated Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. TerrAscend first performs a qualitative assessment. If based on the results of a qualitative assessment it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds 25 its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment test is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, TerrAscend performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration As a result of some of its acquisitions, TerrAscend recognizes a contingent consideration payable, which is an obligation to transfer additional assets to the seller if future events occur. The liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period to determine its fair value. A gain or loss is recognized as a result of the revaluation. (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement by issuing 18,679 convertible preferred stock units, each unit consisting of one non-voting, non-participating preferred share and one preferred share warrant (""Preferred Warrant""). The Preferred Warrants were recorded as a warrant liability and are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting unit using the Black Scholes model. A gain or loss is recognized as a result of the revaluation. Finance and other expenses Finance and other expenses consists primarily of interest expense on TerrAscend's outstanding debt obligations. Transaction and restructuring costs Transaction costs include costs incurred in connection with TerrAscend's acquisitions, such as expenses related to professional fees, consulting, legal and accounting. Restructuring costs are those costs associated with severance and restructuring of business units. Impairment of property and equipment TerrAscend evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When TerrAscend determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss represents the loss recognized on the remeasurement of USD denominated cash and other assets recorded in the Canadian dollars functional currency at TerrAscend's Canadian operations. Unrealized and realized gain on investments TerrAscend accounts for its investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a valuation technique which maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs, with subsequent holding changes in fair value recognized in unrealized gain or loss on investments in the consolidated statement of loss. Provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which TerrAscend conducts business. Results from Operations- Three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 The following tables represent the Company’s results from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Revenue, net 26 For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Revenue $ 69,720 $ 49,060 Excise and cultivation taxes (322 ) $ (475 ) Revenue, net $ 69,398 $ 48,585 $ change $ 20,813 % change 43 % Revenue increased from $49,060 to $69,720 driven by growth in retail offset by a decline in wholesale. Retail revenue increased from $25,718 during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to $55,422 during the three months-ended March 31, 2023. The increase is primarily a result of adult use coming online in New Jersey in April 2022 and the Gage acquisition, which closed on March 10, 2022. The increase in retail revenue is partially offset by $8,891 decrease in wholesale revenue related to the company’s decision to discontinue bulk wholesale sales in Michigan. Cost of Sales For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Cost of sales $ 34,701 $ 31,888 Impairment and write downs of inventory 797 1,073 Total cost of sales $ 35,498 $ 32,961 $ change $ 2,537 % change 8 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 51 % 67 % The increase of $2,537 in cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 is mainly a result of the Gage, Pinnacle and AMMD acquisitions. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is primarily a result of greater operating leverage driven by adult use implementation in New Jersey in April 2022. The company wrote off $797 of packaging inventory due primarily to defective cartridges during the three months ended March 31, 2023. On February 4, 2022, more than 500 vape products were recalled by the Pennsylvania's Department of Health, including several of the Company's SKUs. As a result of the recall, the Company wrote off $854 of inventory during the three months ended March 31,2022. In addition, management impaired its inventory by $219 as it was deemed unsaleable. General and Administrative Expense (G&A) For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 General and administrative expense $ 27,730 $ 21,424 $ change $ 6,306 % change 29 % The increase in G&A expense of $6,306 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily a result of payroll and marketing expense increasing by $4,698 and $1,269, respectively, as a result of the Gage acquisition that closed on March 10, 2022. Amortization and Depreciation Expense For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Amortization and depreciation $ 2,029 $ 2,175 $ change $ (146 ) % change -7 % The decrease of $146 in amortization and depreciation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 is primarily due to a brand intangible asset that was fully amortized during 2022. Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset 27 For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset $ (438 ) $ (5,713 ) $ change $ 5,275 % change -92 % The Preferred Share warrant liability has been remeasured to fair value at March 31, 2023 using the Black Scholes model. The Company recognized a gain during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as a result of the reduction of the Company's share price from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023, as well as from warrants exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $438 for the three months ended March 31.2023. The Preferred Share warrant liability was remeasured to fair value at March 31, 2022 using the Black Scholes model. The Company recognized a gain during the three months ended March 31, 2022 as a result of the reduction of the Company's share price from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, as well as from warrants exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $7,208. Additionally, the Company remeasured the warrant liability acquired through the Gage Acquisition at March 31, 2022 using the Black Scholes model. The Company recognized a loss of $3,864 during the three months ended March 31, 2022 as a result of the increase in the Company's stock price between March 31, 2022 and the acquisition date of March 10, 2022. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the purchase option derivative asset related to the option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership of the Company's New Jersey partnership, was remeasured using the Monte Carlo simulation model and resulted in a loss of $318. Finance and other expenses For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Finance and other expenses $ 10,087 $ 6,655 $ change $ 3,432 % change 52 % The increase of $3,432 in finance and other expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 is primarily due to the Gage acquisition which closed on March 10, 2022, the Pelorus loan agreement that was entered into on October 11, 2022 and the $2,235 employee retention credits transfer fee that was incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Transaction and restructuring costs For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Transaction and restructuring costs $ 3 $ 615 $ change $ (612 ) % change -100 % The decrease of $612 in transaction and restricting costs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 relates primarily to the Gage Acquisition, which closed on March 10, 2022. Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gain) loss $ (31 ) $ 356 $ change $ (387 ) % change -109 % The decrease of $387 in unrealized foreign exchange loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 is a result of the remeasurement of US dollar denominated cash and other assets recorded in Canadian dollar functional currency at the Company’s Canadian operations. 28 Provision for income taxes For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 12,664 $ 3,743 $ change $ 8,921 % change 238 % The increase of 8,921 in provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily driven by the increase in gross profit as a result of growth in new jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 $ $ Cash and cash equivalents 32,931 26,158 Current assets 113,784 121,993 Non-current assets 587,792 579,594 Current liabilities 156,072 137,905 Non-current liabilities 246,203 242,511 Working capital (42,288 ) (15,912 ) Total shareholders' equity 299,301 321,171 The calculation of working capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. TerrAscend defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP. Liquidity and going concern At March 31, 2023, TerrAscend had an accumulated deficit of $641,517. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, TerrAscend incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $19,178. Additionally, as of March 31, 2023 the Company’s current liabilities exceed its current assets. Therefore, TerrAscend expects that it will need additional capital to continue to fund its operations. The aforementioned indicators raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. TerrAscend believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including (i) identifying access to future capital, (ii) continued sales growth from TerrAscend's consolidated operations, and (iii) various actions that were implemented during the latter part of 2022 and continued during the three months ended March 31, 2023 leading to general and administrative expense reductions and other cost and efficiency improvements. Since its inception, TerrAscend's primary sources of capital have been through the issuance of equity securities or debt facilities, and TerrAscend has received aggregate net proceeds from such transactions totaling $608,315 as of March 31, 2023. TerrAscend expects to fund any additional future requirements through the following sources of capital: Capital requirements The Company has $198,894 in principal amounts of loans payable at March 31, 2023. Of this amount, $48,292 are due within the next twelve months. 29 TerrAscend has entered into leases for certain premises and offices for which it owes monthly lease payments. TerrAscend has $74,457 in lease obligations. Of this amount, $6,264 are due in the next twelve months. Additionally, TerrAscend makes monthly payments on financing obligations on six of its real estate properties with $15,161 payable, $1,926 of which is due in the next twelve months TerrAscend's undiscounted contingent consideration payable is $4,434 at March 31, 2023. The contingent consideration payable relates to TerrAscend's business acquisitions of the Apothecarium and State Flower and is due in the next twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend expensed $7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses. The final payment of $3,750 is expected to be due in 2023. At March 31, 2023, the Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $50,784 and corporate income taxes payable of $34,737. TerrAscend does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on TerrAscend's results of operations or financial condition, including and without limitation, such consideration as liquidity and capital resources. TerrAscend intends to meet its capital commitments through any or all of the sources of capital noted above. TerrAscend's objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance future obligations. Debt facilities Ilera Term Loan On December 18, 2020, WDB Holding PA, a subsidiary of TerrAscend, entered into a senior secured term loan with a syndicate of lenders in the amount of $120,000 (""Ilera Term Loan""). The term loan bears interest at 12.875% per annum and matures on December 17, 2024. TerrAscend has the ability to increase the facility by up to $30,000. WDB Holding PA's obligation under the Ilera Term Loan and related transaction documents are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA, Inc., and certain subsidiaries of WDB Holding PA, and secured by TerrAscend USA Inc.'s equity interest in WDB Holding PA and substantially all of the assets of WDB Holding PA and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto. The loan can be refinanced at the option of the borrower after 18 months from the closing date subject to a premium payment due. Of the total proceeds received, $105,767 was used to satisfy the remaining Ilera earn-out payments. On April 28, 2022, the Ilera Term Loan was amended to provide WDB Holding PA with greater flexibility by resetting the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio levels that must be satisfied at the end of each measurement period and extending the date in which WDB Holding PA is required to deliver its budget for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. In addition, the no-call period was extended from 18 months to 30 months, subject to a premium payment. This modification was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On November 11, 2022, WDB Holding PA, TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors party to the Ilera Term Loan and the PA Agent (on behalf of the required lenders) entered into an amendment to the PA Credit Agreement, pursuant to which PA Agent and the required lenders agreed that WDB Holding PA's obligation to maintain the consolidated interest coverage ratio as set forth in the PA Credit Agreement for the period ended September 30, 2022, shall not apply, subject to certain conditions, including (but not limited to) an obligation to enter into a subsequent amendment agreement on or before December 15, 2022, documenting certain enhancements and amendments to the PA Credit Agreement to be agreed. In addition, WDB Holding PA offered a prepayment of $5,000 pro rata to all lenders holding outstanding loans thereunder at a price equal to 103.22% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On December 21, 2022, WDB Holding PA completed an amendment to reduce TerrAscend's principal debt by $35,000 and annual interest expense by $5,000. TerrAscend agreed to make a $35,000 payment at the original prepayment price of 103.22% to par, and agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to add certain collateral to Ilera Term Loan, collectively by March 15, 2023. The amendment further provided that should WDB Holding PA not maintain the prescribed interest coverage ratio, the Company shall be required to deposit funds, as outlined in the amendment, into a restricted account, and no event of default shall occur. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On March 15, 2023, WDB Holding PA, in exchange for a fee in the amount of 1% of the then outstanding principal loan balance, agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the obligation date to prepay TerrAscend's debt from March 15, 2023 to June 30, 30 2023 in which WDB Holding PA must use commercially reasonable efforts to add additional collateral to the Ilera Term Loan, (ii) increase the amount of debt to be reduced by up to $37,000, subject to certain reductions in amount based on meeting certain time based milestones, at a prepayment price of 103.22% to par, and (iii) extend the next test date in respect of the interest coverage ratio until June 30, 2023. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . There is $115,000 of principal amounts outstanding at March 31, 2023. Gage Loans The Gage Acquisition included a senior secured term loan (the ""Original Gage Term Loan"") with an acquisition date fair value of $53,857. The credit agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate plus 7% or (ii) 10.25%. The term loan is payable monthly and matures on November 30, 2022. The term loan is secured by a first lien on all Gage assets. On August 10, 2022, the Original Gage Term Loan was amended as a result of the corporate restructure in conjunction with the Gage Acquisition. The amendment to the Original Gage Term Loan includes the addition of a borrower and guarantor under the term loan and a right of first offer in favor of the administrative agent for a refinancing of the term loan. This amendment was not considered extinguishment of debt under ASC 470 Debt . On November 29, 2022, TerrAscend repaid $30,000 outstanding principal amount on the Original Gage Term Loan. On November 30, 2022, the remaining loan principal amount of $25,000 on the Original Gage Term Loan was amended (the ""Amended Gage Term Loan""). The Amended Gage Term Loan bears interest on $25,000 at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the U.S. ""prime rate"" plus 6.00%, and (ii) 13.0% and matures on November 1, 2024. Commencing on May 31, 2023, TerrAscend will make monthly principal repayments of 0.40% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Additionally, the unpaid principal amount of the loan shall bear paid in kind interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum. No prepayment fees are owed if TerrAscend voluntarily prepays the loan after 18 months. If such prepayment occurs prior to 18 months, a prepayment fee equal to all of the interest on the loans that would be due after the date of such prepayment, is owed. Under the Amended Gage Term Loan, TerrAscend has the ability to borrow incremental term loans of $30,000 at the option of TerrAscend and subject to consents from the required lenders. The additional $30,000 incremental term loans available under the amendment have not been drawn as of December 31, 2022. This loan represents a loan syndication, and therefore TerrAscend assessed each of the lenders separately under ASC 470 Debt to determine if this represents a modification, or an extinguishment of debt. For three of the four remaining lenders, it was determined that this was a modification. For the remaining lender, it was determined that this represented an extinguishment of debt and therefore the fees paid to the lenders on modification were expensed. As a result of this transaction, TerrAscend expensed $1,907 of fees paid to the lenders and third parties as they did not meet the criteria for capitalization under ASC 470 Debt . Additionally, the Gage Acquisition included a loan payable to a former owner of a licensed entity with an acquisition date fair value of $2,683, and a promissory note with an acquisition date fair value of $4,065. The loan payable to the former owner bears interest at a rate of 0.2%. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 6%. There is $4,583 of principal amounts outstanding at March 31, 2023 on the loan payable and promissory note. Pinnacle Loans The Pinnacle Acquisition purchase price included two promissory notes in an aggregate amount of $10,000 to pay down all Pinnacle liabilities and encumbrances. The promissory note matures on June 30, 2023 and bears interest rates of 6%. There is $8,833 of principal amounts outstanding at March 31, 2023 on the two promissory notes. Pelorus Term Loan On October 11, 2022, subsidiaries of TerrAscend, among others, entered into a loan agreement with Pelorus Fund REIT, LLC (""Pelorus"") for a single-draw senior secured term loan (""Pelorus Term Loan"") in an aggregate principal amount of $45,478. The Pelorus Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate tied to the one month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), subject to a base rate, plus 9.5%, with interest-only payments for the first 36 months. The base rate is defined as, on any day, the greatest of (i) 2.5%, (b) the effective federal funds rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%, and (c) one month SOFR in effect on such day. The obligations of the borrowers under the Pelorus Term Loan are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and certain other subsidiaries of TerrAscend and secured by all of the assets of TerrAscend's Maryland and New Jersey businesses, including certain real estate in Maryland and New Jersey, but excluding the AMMD. The Pelorus Term Loan matures on October 11, 2027. There is $45,478 of principal amounts outstanding at March 31, 2023. 31 Cash Flows Cash flows (used in) / provided by operating activities For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Net cash (used in) / provided by operating activities $ 8,434 $ (18,847 ) The increase of $27,281 in net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to March 31, 2022 is due primarily to lower interest of $5,815, reduced taxes of $8,921 and an increase of $6,882 from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023 as compared to a decrease of $11,151 from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other payables due to timing of those payments. Additionally, the Frederick lease termination fee of $3,300 was paid during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Cash flows (used in) / provided by investing activities For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Net cash (used in) / provided by investing activities $ (11,581 ) $ 13,913 The net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily relates to the cash paid to AMMD of $9,611. Additionally, TerrAscend increased the investment in property and equipment by $2,497 during the three months ended March 31, 2023. In comparison, the net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily relates to the cash acquired through the Gage Acquisition of $ 24,716. The cash provided by investing activities is offset by investments in property and equipment of $10,251 primarily related to the buildout of a cultivation site in Maryland, continuing renovations at the Company's Pennsylvania cultivation site, as well as the continued buildout of the Company's Lodi alternative treatment center in New Jersey. Cash flows provided by financing activities For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 9,398 $ 17,068 Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily due to cash inflow as a result of transfer with recourse of Employee Retention Credit, offset by principal payments on loans of $1,204 and capital contributions paid to non-controlling interest holders of $1,884. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, 7,989,436 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of $23,330 and 68,215 stock options were exercised at $1.93-$5.21 (C$2.42-$6.53) per unit for total gross proceeds of $192. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of State Flower of $6,630. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, TerrAscend reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. TerrAscend believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company’s ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and TerrAscend calculates (i) Adjusted gross profit as gross profit from continuing operations adjusted for certain material non-cash items, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as EBITDA from continuing operations adjusted for certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments which management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 32 TerrAscend believes Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful performance measure to assess the performance of TerrAscend as it provides more meaningful ongoing operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of TerrAscend’s underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. The table below reconciles net loss to EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. For the Three Months Ended Notes March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Net loss $ (22,769 ) $ (16,006 ) Loss from discontinued operations 3,591 2,256 Loss from continuing operations (19,178 ) (13,750 ) Add (deduct) the impact of: Provision for income taxes 12,664 3,743 Finance expenses 7,875 6,605 Amortization and depreciation 4,771 4,525 EBITDA from continuing operations (a) 6,132 1,123 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) — 1,806 Vape recall (c) — 1,894 Share-based compensation (d) 1,713 3,356 Loss on lease termination and derecognition of ROU asset (e) 205 — Loss from revaluation of contingent consideration (f) — 119 Other one-time items (g) 1,358 1,974 Employee Retention Credits Transfer Fee (h) 2,235 — Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset (i) (437 ) (5,713 ) Indemnification asset release (j) — (25 ) Impairment of property and equipment and loss on disposal of fixed assets (k) 334 — Unrealized and realized loss on investments (l) 699 — Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss (m) (31 ) 356 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations $ 12,208 $ 4,890 TerrAscend calculates adjusted gross profit by adjusting gross profit for the one-time relief of fair value of inventory upon acquisition, non-cash write downs of inventory, vape recall, and other one time adjustments to gross profit as TerrAscend does not believe that these impacts are reflective of ongoing operations. The table below reconciles gross profit to adjusted gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022: Notes March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022 Gross profit $ 33,900 $ 15,624 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) - 1,806 Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) - 1,894 Other one time adjustments to gross profit (n) 94 238 Adjusted gross profit $ 33,994 $ 19,562 33 The increase in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily due to implementation of adult use sales in New Jersey and improvement in operations in Michigan. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company's future financial statements will be affected. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates from the information provided in Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,"" included in the 2022 Form 10-K. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that the Company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of its initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.235 billion or more, or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th ; and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company's primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. 34 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2023 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. In the ordinary course of business, TerrAscend is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend's consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. At March 31, 2023, there were no pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of TerrAscend's consolidated financial statements. Item 1A . Risk Factors. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described in Part I, Item 1.A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report. We may disclose changes to risk factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. None. Item 5. Other Information On May 11, 2023, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the “Gefen A&R Agreement”) with Lynn Gefen, the Company’s Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, which among other things, provides for certain change of control provisions. In the event of a change of control, 100% of Ms. Gefen’s unvested options and RSUs will accelerate and vest immediately. In addition, if Ms. Gefen’s employment is terminated without cause or for good reason within 12 months following a change of control, Ms. Gefen will be entitled to two times her Severance Pay (as defined in the Gefen A&R Agreement), two times 35 her COBRA Cash Stipend (as defined in the Gefen A&R Agreement) and, if not yet paid, her full bonus for the prior calendar year and full bonus for the current calendar year.

Exhibits 41 Signatures 43 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that TerrAscend Corp. (“TerrAscend” or the “Company”) believes are, or may be considered to be, “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding the prospects of the Company’s industry or the Company’s prospects, plans, financial position or business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""can"", “expect”, “likely”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “potential”, “proposed”, “estimate” and other similar words, including negative and grammatical variations thereof, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” happen, or by discussions of strategy. Forward-looking statements include estimates, plans, expectations, opinions, forecasts, projections, targets, guidance, or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:  the performance of the Company’s business and operations;  the Company’s expectations regarding revenues, expenses and anticipated cash needs;  the competitive conditions of the industry;  federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the U.S. relating to cannabis operations in the U.S.;  the legalization of the use of cannabis for medical and/or recreational use in the U.S. and the related timing and impact thereof;  laws and regulations and any amendments thereto applicable to the business and the impact thereof;  the competitive advantages and business strategies of the Company;  the Company’s ability to source and operate facilities in the U.S.;  the Company’s ability to integrate and operate the assets acquired from Arise Bioscience Inc.

(""Gage""), and KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings, LLC (collectively, ""Pinnacle"");  any benefits expected from the acquisition of Gage (""Gage Acquisition""); and  Gage’s plans to continue building a diverse portfolio of branded cannabis assets and business arrangements through investments, strategic business relationships and the pursuit of licenses in attractive retail locations in Michigan. Certain of the forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and the general expectations of the Company concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by the Company using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry. Such data is inherently imprecise. The cannabis industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors, which factors are described further below. With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which the Company operates; (iii) the output from the Company’s operations; (iv) consumer interest in the Company’s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of the Company’s activities and products and in the areas of taxation and environmental protection; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) the Company’s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; (x) the Company’s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner; and (xi) the Company’s construction plans and timeframe for completion of such plans. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States relating to cannabis operations in the United States; and those discussed under Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2022 and as amended on March 24, 2022 (""2021 Form 10-K"").

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) 1. Na ture of operations TerrAscend was incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act on March 7, 2017 . TerrAscend provides cannabis products, brands, and services in the United States (""U.S."") and Canada cannabinoid markets where cannabis production or consumption has been legalized for therapeutic or adult use. TerrAscend operates a number of synergistic businesses, including Gage Growth Corp. (""Gage""), a cultivator, processor, and retailer in Michigan; The Apothecarium (“The Apothecarium”), a cannabis dispensary with several retail locations in California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; TerrAscend NJ, LLC (""TerrAscend NJ""), a cultivator, processor and retailer with operations in New Jersey; Ilera Healthcare (“Ilera”), Pennsylvania’s medical cannabis cultivator, processor and dispenser; HMS Health, LLC and HMS Processing, LLC (collectively “HMS”), a medical cannabis cultivator and processor based in Maryland; Valhalla Confections, a manufacturer of cannabis-infused edibles; State Flower, a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Francisco; and Arise Bioscience Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of hemp-derived products. Notwithstanding various states in the U.S. which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under US federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. The Company has been listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange since May 3, 2017, having the ticker symbol ""TER"" and, effective October 22, 2018, the Company began trading on OTCQX under the ticker symbol ""TRSSF"". The Company’s registered office is located at 3610 Mavis Road, Mississauga, Ontario, L5C 1W2. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) of the Company and its subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the opinion of management, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and operating results. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022, or any other interim or future periods. At September 30, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 34,288 . As reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 of $ 310,985 and $ 312,829 , respectively, which primarily related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in its Michigan business (refer to Note 7), and the Company had negative cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 of $ 33,431 . Subsequent to the quarter end, the Company entered into a senior secured term loan in an aggregate amount of $ 45,478 (refer to Note 22 for further details about the loan). The Company has $ 55,000 of debt that becomes due on November 30, 2022 that the Company plans to refinance (refer to Note 8 for more information about the senior secured term loan that becomes due on November 30, 2022). While the Company's cash flow and net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 are indicators that raise substantial doubt about whether the Company will be able to support its operations and meet its obligations in the near term, the Company believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including (i) identifying access to future capital, (ii) continued sales growth from the Company's consolidated operations, and (iii) various actions that were implemented during the three months ended September 30, 2022 leading to general and administrative expense reductions. If the Company is unable to refinance its debt obligations that become due November 30, 2022 and the efforts outlined above are ineffective, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of the Company's operations and financial condition. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2021 contained in the 2021 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to the policies disclosed in Note 2 of the summary of significant accounting policies of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 in the 2021 Form 10-K other than noted below. (b) New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted 7 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued ASU 2022-03, Fair value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which is intended to clarify that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring equity securities at fair value. The ASU differentiates between (i) a restriction that is characteristic of a security (for which the effect of the restriction is included in the equity security's fair value because it is a security-specific characteristic) and (2) a contractual sale restriction (for which the effect of the restriction is not included in the equity security's fair value because it is an entity-specific characteristic). The effective date for adoption is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 for public business entities, with early adoption permitted for both interim and annual financial statements. The Company early adopted this beginning in the interim period ending June 30, 2022 in order to increase the comparability of reported financial information.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) AMMD On April 8, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Allegany Medical Marijuana Dispensary (""AMMD""), a medical dispensary in Maryland from Moose Curve Holdings, LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will acquire 100 % equity interest in AMMD for total consideration of $ 10,000 in cas h, in addition to acquiring related real estate for $ 1,700 . The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The Company intends to rebrand the 8,000 square foot dispensary as The Apothecarium. Pinnacle On August 23, 2022, in order to expand its retail footprint in Michigan, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings, LLC (collectively, ""Pinnacle""), a dispensary operator in Michigan, and related real estate, for total consideration of $ 30,253 , which included consideration paid in cash of $ 12,327 , two promissory notes in an aggregate amount of $ 10,000 , and 4,803,184 common shares of the Company, no par value (""Common Shares""), valued at $ 7,926 . Subject to compliance with securities laws, the Common Shares are subject to a contractual lock-up with one-third of the securities vesting on each of the thirty , sixty and ninety days from the closing date of the transaction. The cash consideration paid included repayments of indebtedness and transaction expenses on behalf of Pinnacle of $ 3,913 and $ 619 , respectively. The transaction includes six retail dispensary licenses, five of which are currently operational and located in the cities of Addison, Buchanan, Camden, Edmore, and Morenci, Michigan. The Company intends to rebrand each of the dispensaries under either the Gage or Cookies retail brand. The terms of the agreement included earn-out consideration to Pinnacle equal to the greater of (i) two times net revenue of Pinnacle over the period commencing April 1, 2022 and continuing through and ending on September 30, 2022, or (ii) eight times EBITDA of Pinnacle over the same period, minus $ 28,500 for either case. If gross margin of Pinnacle is determined to be 90% or less of the gross margin for the six month period ended July 31, 2022, then the payment is calculated based solely on eight times EBITDA. The Company calculated the amount of this earn-out consideration to be $nil at both the closing date and at September 30, 2022. The following table presents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the August 23, 2022 acquisition date and allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: $ Cash and cash equivalents 3,838 Inventory 790 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 93 Property and equipment 5,321 Intangible assets 18,300 Goodwill 9,929 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 938 ) Corporate income taxes payable ( 443 ) Deferred revenue ( 249 ) Deferred tax liability ( 6,388 ) Net assets acquired 30,253 Consideration paid in cash 13,183 Promissory note payable 10,000 Common shares of TerrAscend 7,926 Working capital adjustment ( 856 ) Total consideration 30,253 The acquired intangible assets include retail licenses, which are treated as definite-lived intangible assets and amortized over a 15 year period. The consideration paid reflected the synergies, economies of scale, and workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The accounting for this acquisition has been provisionally determined at September 30, 2022. The fair value of the net assets acquired, specifically with respect to property and equipment, intangible assets, deferred tax liability, and goodwill, has been determined 9 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) provisionally and is subject to adjustment. Upon completion of comprehensive valuation and finalization of the purchase price allocation, the amounts above may be adjusted retrospectively to the acquisition date in future reporting periods. Costs related to this transaction were $ 117 , including legal, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses, and were included in transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). On a standalone basis, had the Company acquired the business on January 1, 2022, sales estimates would have been $ 19,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and net income estimates would have been -$ 7,533 . Actual sales and net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 since the date of acquisition are $ 2,727 and $ 329 , respectively. Gage On March 10, 2022, in order to expand its footprint in key markets, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares (or equivalent) of Gage, a cultivator, processor and retailer with operations in the Michigan market. Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement agreement, for each Gage subordinate voting share and other equity instruments, including outstanding stock options and warrants, each holder received a 0.3001 equivalent replacement award of the Company's respective security at the time of closing based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the Canadian Stock Exchange (""CSE"") on March 10, 2022. On the acquisition date there was consideration in the form o f 51,349,978 Common Shares valued at $ 242,884 , 13,504,500 exchangeable units valued at $ 66,591 , 4,940,364 replacement stock options with a fair value of $ 13,147 , and 282,023 replacement warrants with a fair value of $ 435 . Each of the directors, officers and 10% shareholders of Gage entered into contractual lock-up agreements, which included a total of 23,988,758 Common Shares and 13,504,500 exchangeable share units (""Exchangeable Share Units"").

Of these Common Shares and Exchangeable Share Units, 10,467,229 Common Shares were subject to a 6 month legal restriction in which the restriction is a characteristic of the security, and therefore considered in the fair value of share consideration. As such, a restriction discount of has been placed over the shares subject to lock-up of $ 10,323 . T he fair value of the replacement options and warrants was calculated using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model (""Black Scholes model"") combined with the percentage of the vesting period that was completed prior to the acquisition. Additionally, total consideration included warrant liabilities convertible into equity with a fair value of $ 6,756 . The following table presents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the March 10, 2022 acquisition date and allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: 10 TerrAscend Corp.

The fair value of the cultivation and processing and the retail licenses are $ 81,862 and $ 56,665 , respectively. In addition, the intangible assets include brand intangibles which are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets. The fair value of the brand intangibles is $ 77,185 . The consideration paid reflected the synergies, economies of scale, and workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The accounting for this acquisition has been provisionally determined at September 30, 2022. The fair value of net assets acquired, specifically with respect to inventory, intangible assets, deferred revenue, property and equipment, operating right of use assets, lease liabilities, investments, corporate income taxes payable, deferred tax liability, and goodwill have been determined provisionally and are subject to adjustment.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) Costs related to this transaction were $ 3,680 , including legal, accounting, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses. Of the total amount of transaction costs, $ 1,040 was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and was included in transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. On a standalone basis, had the Company acquired the business on January 1, 2022, sales estimates would have been $ 57,864 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and net loss estimates would have been $ ( 314,365 ) . Actual sales and net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 since the date of acquisition are $ 45,348 and $ ( 305,154 ) , respectively. Contingent consideration Contingent consideration recorded relates to the Company’s business acquisitions. Contingent consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the terms of the agreement. The balance of contingent consideration is as follows: State Flower Apothecarium KCR Total Carrying amount, December 31, 2021 $ 8,360 $ 3,028 $ 1,147 $ 12,535 Payments of contingent consideration ( 7,040 ) — — ( 7,040 ) Revaluation of contingent consideration 86 — 103 189 Carrying amount, September 30, 2022 $ 1,406 $ 3,028 $ 1,250 $ 5,684 Less: current portion ( 1,406 ) ( 3,028 ) — ( 4,434 ) Non-current contingent consideration $ - $ - $ 1,250 $ 1,250 During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company made payments of $ 7,040 to the sellers of its previously acquired State Flower business. The remaining amount will be paid to the sellers of State Flower upon the Company's acquisition of the remaining 50.1 % of State Flower, which is subject to regulatory approval. Refer to Note 20 for discussion of valuation methods used when determining the fair value of the contingent consideration liability at September 30, 2022, and the changes in fair value during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 . The Company’s inventory of dry cannabis and oil includes both purchased and internally produced inventory. The Company’s inventory is comprised of the following items: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Raw materials $ 6,826 $ 3,185 Finished goods 11,314 8,721 Work in process 27,704 26,852 Accessories, supplies and consumables 3,547 3,565 $ 49,391 $ 42,323 On February 4, 2022, more than 500 vape products were recalled by the Pennsylvania's Department of Health, including several of the Company's SKUs. As a result of the recall, the Company wrote off $ nil and $ 1,925 of inventory during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. 12 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) In addition, management wrote down its inventory by $ 6,378 and $ 12,948 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , respectively, and $ 388 and $ 1,087 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 . The inventory write-downs in the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily related to inventory the Company deemed unsaleable in its business in Canada. Additionally, the remaining impairment taken during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was mainly due to the write down of inventory to lower of cost or market which was related to the Company's operational reconfiguration of its cultivation facility in Pennsylvania. The inventory write-downs in the prior year period were related to unsaleable disposable vape pens with faulty batteries as well as inventory in Canada that the Company deemed unsaleable.

The following table summarizes the activity in the Company’s goodwill balance: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 90,326 Acquisitions (see Note 4) 160,201 Measurement period adjustment (see Note 4) 18,113 Impairment of goodwill ( 178,314 ) Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 90,326 Impairment of Intangible Assets For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Finite lived intangible assets Software $ - $ - $ - $ 9 Licenses 133,728 — 133,728 — Customer Relationships — — — 2,000 Non-compete agreements — — — 224 Total impairment of finite lived intangible assets 133,728 — 133,728 2,233 Indefinite lived intangible assets Brand intangibles 19,200 — 19,200 1,400 Total impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 19,200 — 19,200 1,400 Total impairment of intangible assets $ 152,928 $ - $ 152,928 $ 3,633 Long-lived assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company determined that changes in market 14 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) expectations of cash flows in its Michigan business, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were indicators that an impairment test was appropriate. The impairment test for long-lived assets is a two-step test, whereby management first determines the recoverable amount by calculating the undiscounted cash flows of each asset group. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the asset group, then impairment is indicated. The Company then determines the fair value of the asset group and allocates the impairment to the assets, being the (i) cultivation and processing licenses, and (ii) retail licenses, acquired through the Gage Acquisition. The Company compared the carrying value of the assets to its fair value and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for both the retail and the cultivation and processing licenses. As such, the Company recorded impairment of $ 78,998 and $ 54,730 for the cultivation and processing licenses and retail licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to $ nil . The fair value of each asset group was determined using cash flows expected to be generated by market participants, discounted at a weighted average cost of capital. The fair value of the specific assets that were impaired was determined using the multi period excess earnings method based on the following key assumptions: Indefinite lived intangible assets Indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whether there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. The Company determined that the existence of impairment on certain long-lived assets, together with the changes in market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state since the Company acquired the indefinite lived assets, indicate that the fair value of the Gage brand intangible assets are more likely than not lower than the carrying value. As such, t he Company performed an impairment analysis and determined the fair value of its brand intangibles using the relief of royalty method. As a result of the quantitative analysis performed, the Company recognized impairment of $ 19,200 , reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to $ 57,985 . In August 2021, the Company made the decision to undertake a strategic review process to explore, review and evaluate potential alternatives for its Arise business focused on maximizing shareholder value. As a result of this review, the Company recorded impairment of intangible assets of $ 3,633 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value has been impaired. Based on the indicators of impairment noted previously, the Company determined that there were indicators that the fair value of its reporting units are more likely than not lower than its carrying value. As such, a one-step quantitative impairment test was performed over its Michigan reporting unit, which includes goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition. The following significant assumptions were applied in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model: 15 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded impairment of goodwill of $ 178,314 at its Michigan reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and Pinnacle Acquisition to $nil. As discussed in Note 4, the accounting for the acquisitions is provisional and subject to adjustment. Therefore, the impairment loss recognized for intangible assets and goodwill are also provisional until management has finalized the accounting for the acquisitions.

The seller then becomes the lessee and the buyer becomes the lessor. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 842, both parties must assess whether the buyer-lessor has obtained control of the asset and a sale has occurred. The Company's subsidiary Gage entered into leaseback transactions on five properties of owned real estate. The Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify as a sale because control was not transferred to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company has classified the lease portion of the transaction as a finance lease and continues to depreciate the asset. The Gage Acquisition (refer to Note 4) included financing obligations. The balance at September 30, 2022 was $ 12,182 . Of this amount, $ 775 is included in other current liabilities and $ 11,407 is included in financing obligations in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The post-combination options vest over a 1- 3 year period. The fair value of the replacement options are estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: March 10, 2022 Volatility 55.0 %- 80.0 % Risk-free interest rate 1.22 %- 1.94 % Expected life (years) 1.00 - 5.00 Dividend yield 0 % The fair value of the various stock options granted was estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Volatility 77.55 % - 77.89 % 79.05 % - 81.51 % Risk-free interest rate 1.63 % - 3.51 % 0.90 % - 1.72 % Expected life (years) 9.62 - 10.01 4.57 - 10.05 Dividend yield 0 % 0 % Forfeiture rate 24.47 % 23.21 % - 27.73 % 20 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company's stock price. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on US treasury bond issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend yield is zero since the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $ 6,378 and $ 13,358 , respectively.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. 24 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) The following table represents the fair value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis: At September 30, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 34,288 $ - — $ - $ 79,642 $ - — $ - Restricted cash 1,031 — — — — — Purchase option derivative asset — — 50 — — 868 Total Assets $ 35,319 $ - $ 50 $ 79,642 $ - $ 868 Liabilities Contingent consideration payable $ - $ - $ 5,684 $ - $ - $ 12,535 Warrant liability — 679 — — 54,986 — Total Liabilities $ - $ 679 $ 5,684 $ - $ 54,986 $ 12,535 There were no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within levels of the fair value hierarchy are presented below: Level 1 Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. Level 2 Warrant liability The following table summarizes the changes in the warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2022: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 54,986 Addition on acquisition 6,756 Included in gain on fair value of warrants ( 59,373 ) Exercises ( 1,690 ) Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 679 The Company's warrant liability consists of its Series A, B, C, and D convertible preferred stock issued through its 2020 private placements (""private placement warrant liability""), as well as the warrant liability acquired through its Gage Acquisition (""Gage warrant liability"") (refer to Note 4). The private placement warrant liability has been measured at fair value at September 30, 2022. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes model were as follows: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 1.28 $ 6.11 Warrant exercise price $ 3,000 $ 3,000 Warrant conversion ratio $ 1,000 $ 1,000 Annual volatility 73.3 % 65.5 % Annual risk-free rate 4.0 % 0.6 % Expected term (in years) 0.6 1.4 The Gage warrant liability has been remeasured at fair value at September 30, 2022. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes model were as follows: 25 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) September 30, 2022 March 10, 2022 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 1.28 $ 4.92 Warrant exercise price $ 8.66 $ 8.66 Annual volatility 69.72 % - 70.19 % 65.0 % Annual risk-free rate 4.2 % 1.7 % Expected term (in years) 1.3 2.0 Level 3 Purchase option derivative asset The following table summarizes the changes in the purchase option derivative asset: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 868 Revaluation of purchase option derivative asset ( 818 ) Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 50 The purchase option derivative asset has been measured at fair value at the transaction date using the Monte Carlo simulation model that relies on assumptions around the Company's EBITDA volatility and risk adjusted discount, among others. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model are summarized below: September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Term (in years) 0.8 1.3 Risk-free rate 2.5 % 0.4 % EBITDA discount rate 15.5 % 15.0 % EBITDA volatility 37.1 % 44.0 % Contingent Consideration Payable The fair value of contingent consideration at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was determined using a probability weighted model based on the likelihood of achieving certain revenue and EBITDA scenario outcomes. A discount rate of 12.2 % ( September 30, 2021 – 12.8 %) was utilized to determine the present value of the liabilities, resulting in a loss on revaluation of contingent consideration of $ 36 and $ 189 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively (September 30, 2021 - ($ 338 ) and $ 2,652 , respectively). The illustrative variance of the total contingent consideration at September 30, 2022 based on reasonably possible changes to one of the significant unobservable inputs, holding other inputs constant, would have the following effects: Discount rate sensitivity KCR Increase 100 basis points $ 1,212 Increase 50 basis points $ 1,231 Decrease 50 basis points $ 1,271 Decrease 100 basis points $ 1,292 Legal proceedings In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, product liability, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. At September 30, 2022 , there were no pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 26 TerrAscend Corp.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to the Company's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth under ""Risk Factors"" in the 2021 Form 10-K, its actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the following discussion and analysis. Unless otherwise noted, dollar amounts in this Item 2 are in thousands of U.S. dollars. Overview TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, licensed cultivation and processing operations in Michigan and Maryland, and licensed processing operations in Canada. TerrAscend operates a chain of Apothecarium dispensary retail locations, as well as scaled cultivation, processing, and manufacturing facilities on both the east and west coasts of the United States. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent, high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use market. Notwithstanding various states in the U.S. which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. TerrAscend operates under one operating segment which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend’s portfolio of operating businesses and brands include: Recent Developments Pending and Subsequent Transactions 28 Results from Operations- Three months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 The following tables represent the Company’s results from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Revenue, net For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Revenue $ 67,726 $ 50,537 Excise and cultivation taxes (701 ) (1,398 ) Revenue, net $ 67,025 $ 49,139 $ change $ 17,886 % change 36 % The increase in net revenue at September 30, 2022 as compared to September 30, 2021 was due to an increase in retail revenue of $28,528 from $24,918 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $53,446 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in revenue was mainly due to adult use sales in New Jersey which commenced during the current year, as well as the acquisition of Gage (the ""Gage Acquisition"") in Michigan in March 2022. Retail dispensaries increased from 13 at September 30, 2021 to 30 at September 30, 2022. The increase was partially offset by the decrease of $10,642 in wholesale revenue from $24,221 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to $13,579 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, which was mainly related to challenging market dynamics in Pennsylvania. Cost of Sales For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Cost of sales $ 36,284 $ 27,494 Impairment and write downs of inventory 6,378 148 Total cost of sales $ 42,662 $ 27,642 $ change $ 15,020 % change 54 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 64 % 56 % The increase in cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was driven mainly by the Gage Acquisition, as well as an increase in New Jersey due to the increase in adult use sales which commenced during the current year. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was due to lower volumes in Pennsylvania leading to under-absorption, primarily related to lower wholesale flower sales, as well as operational challenges at the Company's cultivation facility in Frederick, Maryland as the Company transitioned to its Hagerstown location. In addition, management wrote down its inventory by $6,378 and $148 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The inventory write-downs in the current year period were mainly due to inventory deemed unsaleable in its business in Canada. The inventory write-downs in the prior year period were related to inventory that the Company deemed unsaleable in its business in Canada. 29 General and Administrative Expense (G&A) For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 General and administrative expense $ 29,385 $ 21,320 $ change $ 8,065 % change 38 % G&A excluding share-based compensation $ 26,680 $ 16,142 G&A excluding share-based compensation as a % of revenue 40 % 33 % The increase in G&A expenses was primarily a result of increased office and general expenses of $7,030 and increased salaries and wages of $3,268, which are primarily a result of the Gage Acquisition in March 2022. Amortization and Depreciation Expense For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Amortization and depreciation $ 3,032 $ 1,947 $ change $ 1,085 % change 56 % The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to the Gage Acquisition during March 2022. The Company acquired retail licenses, which are amortized over a 15 year period. The fair value of the retail licenses at acquisition were $56,665. Impairment of intangible assets For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Impairment of intangible assets $ 152,928 $ - $ change $ 152,928 % change 100 % During the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company performed impairment analyses over its indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition as the changes in the market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were determined to be indicators of impairment. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of its definite lived retail and cultivation and processing licenses was greater than its fair value, and therefore recorded impairment of $78,998 and $54,730 for the retail and cultivation and processing licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to $nil at September 30, 2022. Additionally, the Company recorded impairment of its indefinite lived brand intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition of $19,200, reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to $57,985 at September 30, 2022. Impairment of goodwill For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Impairment of goodwill $ 178,314 $ - $ change $ 178,314 % change 100 % During the three months ended September 30, 2022, as it was determined that it was more likely than not that the Michigan reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying value, a one-step goodwill quantitative impairment test was performed. As a result of the quantitative impairment test, the Company recorded impairment of goodwill of $178,314 at its Michigan reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and Pinnacle Acquisition to $nil. 30 The impairment of goodwill for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was related to the Company's Florida reporting unit as the Company determined that the estimated cash flows of its Arise business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill. As a result, the Company recorded impairment to reduce the balance of goodwill at its Florida reporting unit to $nil. Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset $ (5,497 ) $ (69,016 ) $ change $ 63,519 % change -92 % The warrant liability was remeasured to fair value at September 30, 2022 using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model (""Black Scholes model""). The Company recognized a gain on fair value of warrants of $5,497 during the three months ended September 30, 2022 as a result of the reduction of the Company's share price from June 30, 2022, as compared to September 30, 2022. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized a gain on fair value of warrants of $69,016 as a result of the decrease in the Company's share price from June 30, 2021 to September 30, 2021 as well as warrants exercised during the three months ended September 30, 2021. Finance and other expenses For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Finance and other expenses $ 9,469 $ 6,972 $ change $ 2,497 % change 36 % The increase in finance and other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to interest expense recognized on the loans acquired as part of the Gage Acquisition. Transaction and restructuring costs For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Transaction and restructuring costs $ 1,359 $ 1,034 $ change $ 325 % change 31 % The transaction and restructuring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily due to personnel related reorganization and severance costs in Canada. The transaction and restructuring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2021 included legal costs related to the acquisitions of KCR, HMS, and Gage. Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss (gain) For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss (gain) $ 586 $ (1,256 ) $ change $ 1,842 % change -147 % The Company recognized an unrealized foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to a gain for the three months ended September 30, 2021, which was a result of the remeasurement related to USD denominated liabilities recorded in C$ functional currency at the Company’s Canadian operations. 31 Unrealized and realized gain on investments For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Unrealized and realized gain on investments $ (231 ) $ - $ change $ (231 ) % change 100 % The gain on investment during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was related to the revaluation of the investments acquired through the Gage Acquisition.

Cost of Sales For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Cost of sales $ 104,119 $ 69,679 Impairment and write downs of inventory 14,873 263 Total cost of sales $ 118,992 $ 69,942 $ change $ 49,050 % change 70 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 66 % 43 % The increase in cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to nine months ended September 30, 2021 was driven mainly by the Gage Acquisition, as well as an increase in New Jersey due to the increase in adult use sales which commenced 32 during the current year. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was due to lower volumes in Pennsylvania leading to under-absorption, primarily related to lower wholesale flower sales, as well as operational challenges at the Company's cultivation facility in Frederick, Maryland as the Company transitions to its Hagerstown location. In addition, management wrote down its inventory by $14,873 and $263 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The inventory write-downs in the current year period were mainly due to the write down of inventory to lower of cost or market which was related to the Company's operational reconfiguration of its cultivation facility in Pennsylvania, write downs of inventory related to the vape recall in Pennsylvania, as well as inventory deemed unsaleable in its business in Canada. The impairment recorded in the prior year period was due to obsolete or slow-moving inventory at the Company's Arise business and other inventory that the Company deemed unsaleable in its business in Canada. General and Administrative Expense (G&A) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 General and administrative expense $ 85,918 $ 62,462 $ change $ 23,456 % change 38 % G&A excluding share-based compensation $ 75,394 $ 49,069 G&A excluding share-based compensation as a % of revenue 42 % 30 % The increase in G&A expenses was primarily a result of increased salaries and wages of $11,083, office and general expenses of $9,415, and sales and marketing of $4,672, which is primarily a result of the Gage Acquisition. Amortization and Depreciation Expense For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Amortization and depreciation $ 8,666 $ 5,664 $ change $ 3,002 % change 53 % The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to September 30, 2020 was primarily due to the Gage Acquisition during March 2022. The company acquired retail licenses which are amortized over a 15 year period. The fair value of the retail licenses at acquisition was $53,321. Impairment of intangible assets For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Impairment of intangible assets $ 152,928 $ 3,633 $ change $ 149,295 % change 4109 % During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company performed impairment analyses over its indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition as the changes in the market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were determined to be indicators of impairment. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of its definite lived retail and cultivation and processing licenses was greater than its fair value, and therefore recorded impairment of $78,998 and $54,730 for the retail and cultivation and processing licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to $nil at September 30, 2022. Additionally, the Company recorded impairment of its indefinite lived brand intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition of $19,200, reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to $57,985 at September 30, 2022. The impairment recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 related to the write-off of intellectual property at the Company’s Arise business. Impairment of goodwill 33 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Impairment of goodwill $ 178,314 $ 5,007 $ change $ 173,307 % change 3461 % During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as it was determined that it was more likely than not that the Michigan reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying value, a one-step goodwill quantitative impairment test was performed. As a result of the quantitative impairment test, the Company recorded impairment of goodwill of $178,314 at its Michigan reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and Pinnacle Acquisition to $nil. The impairment recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 related to the Company’s Florida reporting unit as the Company determined that the estimated cash flows of its Arise business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill. As a result, the company recorded impairment to reduce the balance of goodwill at its Florida reporting unit to $nil. Revaluation of contingent consideration For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Revaluation of contingent consideration $ 189 $ 2,652 $ change $ (2,463 ) % change -93 % The decrease in the revaluation of contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was a result of a reduction in the liability as compared to September 30, 2021 due to payments for the earnout of State Flower of $7,040 made subsequent to September 30, 2021, reducing the amount outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by the accretion of the contingent consideration payable for KCR, which is recorded at the present value of future payments upon initial recognition. Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset $ (58,555 ) $ (43,715 ) $ change $ (14,840 ) % change 34 % The warrant liability was remeasured to fair value at September 30, 2022 using the Black Scholes model. The Company recognized a gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as a result of the reduction of the Company's share price from December 31, 2021 as compared to September 30, 2022, as well as from warrants exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $59,373. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the purchase option derivative asset related to the option to purchase an additional 6.25% of ownership of the Company's New Jersey partnership, were remeasured using the Monte Carlo simulation model and resulted in a loss of $818. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized a gain on fair value of warrants of $43,715 as a result of the decrease in the Company's share price from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021 as well as warrants exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Finance and other expenses For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Finance and other expenses $ 30,227 $ 22,281 $ change $ 7,946 % change 36 % 34 The increase in finance and other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to interest expense recognized on the loans acquired as part of the Gage Acquisition. Transaction and restructuring costs For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Transaction and restructuring costs $ 2,601 $ 1,466 $ change $ 1,135 % change 77 % The increase in transaction and restructuring costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to personnel related reorganization and severance costs in Canada. The transaction and restructuring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2021 included legal costs related to the acquisitions of KCR, HMS, and Gage. Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss $ 636 $ 4,582 $ change $ (3,946 ) % change -86 % The decrease in unrealized foreign exchange loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was a result of the remeasurement of USD denominated liabilities recorded in C$ functional currency at the Company’s Canadian operations. Unrealized and realized gain on investments For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Unrealized and realized loss (gain) on investments $ 3 $ (6,192 ) $ change $ 6,195 % change -100 % The loss on investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was related to the revaluation of the investments acquired through the Gage Acquisition. The gain on investment during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 related to the acquisition of the remaining 90% investment in Guadco LLC and KCR Holdings LLC. Provision for income taxes For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Provision for income taxes $ (25,602 ) $ 21,372 $ change $ (46,974 ) % change -220 % The decrease in provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily driven by the decrease in pre-tax book income as a result of the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill recorded by the Company during the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources 35 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 $ $ Cash and cash equivalents 34,288 79,642 Current assets 113,397 143,221 Non-current assets 612,091 438,713 Current liabilities 172,342 61,044 Non-current liabilities 274,324 291,936 Working capital (58,945 ) 82,177 Total shareholders' equity 278,822 228,954 The calculation of working capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. The Company defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP. Sources of liquidity Since its inception, the Company's primary sources of capital have been through the issuance of equity securities or debt facilities, and the Company has received aggregate net proceeds from such transactions totaling $564,896 as of September 30, 2022. The Company expects to fund any additional future requirements through the following sources of capital: Capital requirements As of September 30, 2022, there were no material changes in the Company's short-term and long-term cash requirements from those disclosed in the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" included in the Company's 2021 10-K, except as those described below: The Company has $284,231 in principal amounts of loans payable at September 30, 2022. Of this amount, $78,847 are due within the next twelve months. At September 30, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $34,288. As reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 of $310,985 and $312,829, respectively, which primarily related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in its Michigan business (refer to Note 7), and the Company had negative cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 of $33,431. Subsequent to the quarter end, the Company entered into a senior secured term loan in an aggregate amount of $45,478 (refer to Note 22 for further details about the loan). The Company has $55,000 of debt that becomes due on November 30, 2022 that the Company plans to refinance (refer to Note 8 for more information about the senior secured term loan that becomes due on November 30, 2022). While the Company's cash flow and net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 are indicators that raise substantial doubt about whether the Company will be able to support its operations and meet its obligations in the near term, the Company believes this concern is mitigated by steps to improve its operations and cash position, including (i) identifying access to future capital, (ii) continued sales growth from the Company's consolidated operations, and (iii) various actions that were implemented during the three months ended September 30, 2022 leading to general and administrative expense reductions. If the Company is unable to refinance its debt obligations that become due November 30, 2022 and the efforts outlined above are ineffective, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of the Company's operations and financial condition. The Company has entered into leases for certain premises and offices for which it owes monthly lease payments. The Company has $5,809 in lease obligations due in the next twelve months. Additionally, the Company makes monthly payments on financing obligations on five properties of owned real estate. The Company has $1,887 in financing obligations due in the next twelve months. 36 Through the pending acquisition of AMMD, the Company has capital commitments of $10,000 to purchase all the outstanding equity, in addition to acquiring the real estate for $1,700. In addition, the Company's undiscounted contingent consideration payable is $10,734 at September 30, 2022. The contingent consideration payable relates to the Company's business acquisitions of The Apothecarium, State Flower, and KCR. Contingent consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the agreement. The contingent consideration is revalued at the end of each reporting period. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition, including, and without limitation, such consideration as liquidity and capital resources. The Company’s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance its research and development activities, corporate and administration expenses, working capital and overall capital expenditures. Since inception, the Company has primarily financed its liquidity needs through the issuance of shares and utilization of borrowings. Debt facilities Canopy Growth- Canada Inc loan On November 11, 2022, TerrAscend Canada Inc. and Canopy USA III Limited Partnership (""Canopy USA III LP""), a successor to Canopy Growth Corporation, entered into an agreement for the period commencing August 31, 2022 to (and including) November 30, 2022, subject to certain conditions, whereby Canopy USA III LP agreed to a waiver of TerrAscend Canada Inc.’s obligation to maintain the minimum current assets as set forth in the loan financing agreement with Canopy USA LLL LP (see Note 8 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referencing ""Canopy Growth Canada Inc. loan""). Ilera term loan On April 28, 2022, the Ilera term loan (refer to Note 8 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements) was amended to provide WDB Holding PA, a subsidiary of the Company, with greater flexibility by resetting the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio levels that must be satisfied at the end of each measurement period and extending the date in which WDB Holding PA is required to deliver its budget for the fiscal year ending 2021. In addition, the no-call period was extended from 18 months to 30 months, subject to a premium payment. This modification was not considered extinguishments of debt under ASC 470, Debt. On November 11, 2022, WDB Holding PA, the Company, TerrAscend USA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors party to the PA Credit Agreement and the PA Agent (on behalf of the required lenders) entered into an amendment to the PA Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the PA Agent and the required lenders agreed that WDB Holding PA’s obligation to maintain the consolidated interest coverage ratio as set forth in the PA Credit Agreement for the period ended September 30, 2022, shall not apply, subject to certain conditions, including (but not limited to) an obligation to enter into a subsequent amendment agreement on or before December 15, 2022, documenting certain enhancements and amendments to the PA Credit Agreement to be agreed. In addition, WDB Holding PA offered a prepayment of $5,000 pro rata to all lenders holding outstanding loans thereunder at a price equal to 103.22% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Cash Flows Cash flows used in operating activities For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Net cash used in operating activities $ (33,431 ) $ (28,012 ) The increase in cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is primarily due to an increase in loss from operations, excluding non-cash impairment losses on intangible assets and goodwill, of $32,088 from a profit of $23,148 in the prior year period, as well as changes in working capital items of $6,616. Cash flows used in investing activities For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Net cash used in investing activities $ (12,582 ) $ (95,495 ) 37 The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily relates to investments in property and equipment of $24,678, primarily related to the buildout of a cultivation site in Maryland, continuing renovations at the Company's Pennsylvania cultivation site, as well as the continued buildout of the Company's Lodi alternative treatment center in New Jersey. Additionally, the Company had investments in intangible assets of $1,330, primarily related to adult use licenses in New Jersey. The cash used in investing activities is offset by cash inflows of $16,227 related to the cash acquired through the Gage Acquisition, offset by net cash paid for consideration for the Pinnacle Acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily relates to cash consideration paid for the acquisition of KCR and HMS totaling $42,736. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company made payments of $25,000 related to the purchase of the additional 12.5% of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ from BWH NJ, LLC and Blue Marble Ventures, LLC. Additionally, the Company had investments in property and equipment of $26,706 primarily related to the buildout of the New Jersey operations and expansions in Pennsylvania cultivation and $1,739 related to deposits paid for expansion of the cultivation premises in Pennsylvania. Cash flows from financing activities For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 5,537 $ 167,935 During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, 7,989,436 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of $23,797 and 238,065 stock options were exercised for total gross proceeds of $361. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of State Flower of $6,630, loan principal payments of $6,088, loan amendment fees paid on the modification of the Ilera term loan and the Gage senior secured term loan of $2,309, tax distributions paid on behalf of the partners of the New Jersey operations of $1,436, and distributions to non-controlling interests of $1,237. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, was primarily a result of the private placement on January 28, 2021, in which the Company issued 18,115,656 Common Shares at a price of $9.64 (C$12.35) per Common Share for total proceeds of $173,477, net of share issuance costs of $1,643. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, 2,590,178 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of $6,777 and 829,675 stock options were exercised at $0.67-$6.93 (C$0.85-$8.82) per unit for total gross proceeds of $3,677. In addition, 1,968 Preferred Share warrants were exercised at $3,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of $3,588. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Ilera of $18,274. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company's ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and the Company calculates (i) Adjusted gross profit as gross profit adjusted for certain material non-cash items and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments, which management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful ongoing operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of the Company's underlying 38 business performance and other one-time non-recurring expenses. The table below reconciles net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended Notes September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Net income (loss) $ (310,985 ) $ 55,835 $ (312,829 ) $ 12,062 Add (deduct) the impact of: Provision for income taxes (34,033 ) 4,999 (25,602 ) 21,372 Finance expenses 10,092 6,351 26,217 18,134 Amortization and depreciation 7,110 4,200 19,241 11,250 EBITDA (a) (327,816 ) 71,385 (292,973 ) 62,818 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) 415 1,163 2,770 1,730 Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) 6,037 — 11,931 449 Vape recall (d) — — 2,965 — Share-based compensation (e) 2,705 5,178 10,524 13,393 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (f) 331,242 — 331,242 8,640 (Gain) loss on disposal of fixed assets (g) (81 ) 220 848 256 Revaluation of contingent consideration (h) 36 (338 ) 189 2,652 Restructuring costs and executive severance (i) 1,443 450 1,443 917 Legal settlements (j) 1,170 — 1,170 2,121 Other one-time items (k) 1,311 1,365 4,209 2,487 Gain on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset (l) (5,497 ) (69,016 ) (58,555 ) (43,715 ) Indemnification asset release (m) — 95 3,973 3,891 Unrealized and realized (gain) loss on investments (n) (231 ) — 3 (6,192 ) Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss (gain) (o) 586 (1,256 ) 636 4,582 Adjusted EBITDA $ 11,320 $ 9,246 $ 20,375 $ 54,029 The Company calculates adjusted gross profit to adjust gross profit for the one-time relief of fair value upon acquisition, non-cash write downs of inventory, vape recall and accelerated depreciation as the Company does not believe that these impacts are reflective of ongoing operations. The table below reconciles gross profit to adjusted gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended Notes September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Gross profit $ 24,363 $ 21,497 $ 62,496 $ 91,274 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) 415 1,163 2,770 1,730 Non-cash write downs of inventory (c) 6,037 — 11,931 449 Vape recall (d) — — 2,965 — Facility transition costs (p) 107 — 107 — Accelerated depreciation (q) — — 238 — Adjusted gross profit $ 30,922 $ 22,660 $ 80,507 $ 93,453 39 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to lower volume and resulting gross margin compression mainly related to challenging market dynamics in Pennsylvania. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding the Company's adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Descriptions of the recently issued and adopted accounting principles are included in Item 1. ""Financial Statements"" in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical Accounting Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company's future financial statements will be affected. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting estimates from the information provided in Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,"" included in the 2021 Form 10-K. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that the Company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of its initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.235 billion or more, or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30 th ; and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company's primary risk exposures or management of market risks for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 from those disclosed in its 2021 Form 10-K. Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 40 The Company's management, with the participation of its Principal Executive officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2022 the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. The Company is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings, including litigation related to intellectual property, product liability, employment, and commercial matters. TerrAscend believes that none of the litigation in which it is currently involved in individually or in the aggregate, is material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 21, Legal Proceedings, in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 1A . Risk Factors. Investing in the Company's Common Stock involves a high degree of risk.

(“TerrAscend” or the “Company”) believes are, or may be considered to be, “forward-looking statements.” All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding the prospects of the Company’s industry or the Company’s prospects, plans, financial position or business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “expect”, “likely”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “potential”, “proposed”, “estimate” and other similar words, including negative and grammatical variations thereof, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” happen, or by discussions of strategy. Forward-looking statements include estimates, plans, expectations, opinions, forecasts, projections, targets, guidance, or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:  the performance of the Company’s business and operations;  the Company’s expectations regarding revenues, expenses and anticipated cash needs;  the competitive conditions of the industry;  federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the US relating to cannabis operations in the US;  the legalization of the use of cannabis for medical and/or recreational use in the US and the related timing and impact thereof;  laws and regulations and any amendments thereto applicable to the business and the impact thereof;  the competitive advantages and business strategies of the Company;  the Company’s ability to source and operate facilities in the US;  the Company’s ability to integrate and operate the assets acquired from Arise Bioscience Inc. (“Arise”), the Apothecarium Dispensaries (“The Apothecarium”), Valhalla Confections (“Valhalla”), Ilera Healthcare (“Ilera”), State Flower or ABI SF LLC (“State Flower”), HMS Health, LLC, KCR Holdings LLC, and Gage;  any benefits expected from the Gage Acquisition; and  Gage’s plans to continue building a diverse portfolio of branded cannabis assets and business arrangements through investments, strategic business relationships and the pursuit of licenses in attractive retail locations in Michigan. Certain of the forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and the general expectations of the Company concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by the Company using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry. Such data is inherently imprecise. The cannabis industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors, which factors are described further below. With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which the Company operates; (iii) the output from the Company’s operations; (iv) consumer interest in the Company’s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of the Company’s activities and products and in the areas of taxation and environmental protection; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) the Company’s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; (x) the Company’s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner; and (xi) the Company’s construction plans and timeframe for completion of such plans. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States relating to cannabis operations in the United States; and those discussed under Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The purpose of forward-looking statements is to provide the reader with a description of management’s expectations, and such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for any other purpose. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on the date such forward-looking statements are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, estimates or opinions, future events or results or otherwise or to explain any material difference between subsequent actual events and such forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

The fair value of net assets acquired, specifically with respect to inventory, intangible assets, deferred revenue, property and equipment, operating right of use assets, lease liabilities, investments, corporate income taxes payable, deferred tax liability, and goodwill have been determined provisionally and are subject to adjustment. Upon completion of a comprehensive valuation and finalization of the purchase price allocation, the amounts above may be adjusted retrospectively to the acquisition date in future reporting periods.

The seller then becomes the lessee and the buyer becomes the lessor. Under ASC 842, both parties must assess whether the buyer-lessor has obtained control of the asset and a sale has occurred. The Company's subsidiary Gage entered into leaseback transactions on five properties of owned real estate. The Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify as a sale because control was not transferred to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company has classified the lease portion of the transaction as a finance lease and continues to depreciate the asset. The Gage Acquisition (refer to Note 4) included financing obligations. The balance at June 30, 2022 was $ 12,352 . Of this amount, $ 746 is included in other current liabilities and $ 11,606 is included in financing obligations in the consolidated balance sheets. 14 TerrAscend Corp.

The total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between th e market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the exercise date and the price paid by the option holder to the exercise the option) related to stock options exercised is presented below: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 Exercised $ 79 $ 1,721 $ 140 $ 4,798 The Gage Acquisition included consideration in the form of 4,940,364 replacement options that had been issued before the acquisition date to employees of Gage. The post-combination options vest over a 1- 3 year period. The fair value of the replacement options are estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: 16 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) March 10, 2022 Volatility 55.0 %- 80.0 % Risk-free interest rate 1.22 %- 1.94 % Expected life (years) 1.00 - 5.00 Dividend yield 0 % The fair value of the various stock options granted was estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Volatility 77.55 % - 79.04 % 79.05 % - 81.51 % Risk-free interest rate 1.63 % - 3.02 % 0.90 % - 1.72 % Expected life (years) 9.62 - 10.01 4.57 - 10.05 Dividend yield 0 % 0 % Forfeiture rate 23.73 % 23.21 % - 27.73 % Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company's stock price. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on US treasury bond issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the options. Dividend yield is zero since the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was $ 4,921 and $ 9,140 , respectively. As of June 30, 2022, there was $ 30,806 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) The Company’s objective in managing capital is to ensure a sufficient liquidity position to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order to achieve this objective, the Company prepares a capital budget to manage its capital structure. The Company defines capital as borrowings, equity comprised of issued share capital, share-based payments, accumulated deficit, as well as funds borrowed from related parties. Since inception, the Company has primarily financed its liquidity needs through the issuance of share capital through borrowings. The equity issuances are outlined in Note 11 and debt issuances are outlined in Note 8. The Company is subject to covenants as a result of its loans payable with various lenders. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants as of June 30, 2022. Other than these items related to loans payable as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. On April 28, 2022, the Ilera term loan (refer to Note 8) was amended to provide the Company with greater flexibility, and the optional prepayment date was amended to 30 months (from 18 months ) from the closing date, subject to a premium payment due. On August 10, 2022, the Gage senior secured term loan (refer to Note 8) was amended as a result of the corporate restructure in conjunction with the Gage Acquisition. The amendments to the Gage senior secured term loan include the addition of a borrower and guarantor under the term loan and a right of first offer in favor of the administrative agent for a refinancing of the term loan. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. The following table represents the fair value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis: At June 30, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 48,426 $ - — $ - $ 79,642 $ - — $ - Restricted cash 605 — — — — — Purchase option derivative asset — — 50 — — 868 Total Assets $ 49,031 $ - $ 50 $ 79,642 $ - $ 868 Liabilities Contingent consideration payable — $ - $ 5,648 $ - $ - $ 12,535 Warrant liability — 6,176 — — 54,986 — Total Liabilities $ - $ 6,176 $ 5,648 $ - $ 54,986 $ 12,535 There were no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within levels of the fair value hierarchy are presented below: Level 1 Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. Level 2 Warrant liability The following table summarizes the changes in the warrant liability for the six months ended June 30, 2022: 20 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 54,986 Addition on acquisition 6,756 Included in gain on fair value of warrants ( 53,876 ) Exercises ( 1,690 ) Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 6,176 The Company's warrant liability consists of its Series A, B, C, and D convertible preferred stock issued through its 2020 private placements (""private placement warrant liability""), as well as the warrant liability acquired through its Gage Acquisition (""Gage warrant liability"") (refer to Note 4). The private placement warrant liability has been measured at fair value at June 30, 2022. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation were as follows: June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 2.28 $ 6.11 Warrant exercise price $ 3,000 $ 3,000 Warrant conversion ratio $ 1,000 $ 1,000 Annual volatility 65.7 % 65.5 % Annual risk-free rate 2.9 % 0.6 % Expected term (in years) 0.9 1.4 The Gage warrant liability has been remeasured at fair value at June 30, 2022. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation were as follows: June 30, 2022 March 10, 2022 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 2.28 $ 5.70 Warrant exercise price $ 8.66 $ 8.66 Annual volatility 62.88 % - 63.73 % 61.65 % - 61.87 % Annual risk-free rate 2.9 % 1.8 % Expected term (in years) 1.5 1.7 Level 3 Purchase option derivative asset The following table summarizes the changes in the purchase option derivative asset: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 868 Revaluation of purchase option derivative asset ( 818 ) Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 50 The purchase option derivative asset has been measured at fair value at the transaction date using the Monte Carlo simulation model that relies on assumptions around the Company's EBITDA volatility and risk adjusted discount, among others. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model are summarized below: June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Term (in years) 0.8 1.3 Risk-free rate 2.5 % 0.4 % EBITDA discount rate 15.5 % 15.0 % EBITDA volatility 37.1 % 44.0 % Contingent Consideration Payable 21 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) The fair value of contingent consideration at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was determined using a probability weighted model based on the likelihood of achieving certain revenue and EBITDA scenario outcomes. A discount rate of 12.2 % ( June 30, 2021 – 12.8 %) was utilized to determine the present value of the liabilities, resulting in a loss on revaluation of contingent consideration of $ 34 and $ 153 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively (June 30, 2021 - ($ 7 ) and $ 2,990 , respectively). The illustrative variance of the total contingent consideration at June 30, 2022 based on reasonably possible changes to one of the significant unobservable inputs, holding other inputs constant, would have the following effects: Discount rate sensitivity KCR Increase 100 basis points $ 1,175 Increase 50 basis points $ 1,195 Decrease 50 basis points $ 1,236 Decrease 100 basis points $ 1,258 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, product liability, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. At June 30, 2022 , there were no pending lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 22 TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) 23 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial information and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 17, 2022. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to the Company's plans and strategy for its business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth under ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, its actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the following discussion and analysis. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of the financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend is for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and the accompanying notes for each respective period. Business Overview TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, licensed cultivation and processing operations in Michigan and Maryland, and licensed processing operations in Canada. TerrAscend operates a chain of Apothecarium dispensary retail locations, as well as scaled cultivation, processing, and manufacturing facilities on both the east and west coasts of the United States. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent, high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use market. Notwithstanding various states in the US which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under US federal law for any purpose, by way of the CSA. TerrAscend operates under one operating segment which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend’s portfolio of operating businesses and brands include: Objective TerrAscend's MD&A is designed to provide information about its financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective. It includes relevant components of TerrAscend's financial condition and current and long-term liquidity. Primary revenue drivers include the manufacture, distribution, and sale of medical and adult-use cannabis products where permitted. TerrAscend's primary obligations are related to compliance with state and federal regulators, as applicable. TerrAscend's primary sources of capital have been through the issuance of equity securities or debt. TerrAscend's objective is to discuss how all these factors have affected our historical results and, where applicable, how it expects these factors to impact its future results and future liquidity. 24 Results from Operations- Three months ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 The following tables represent the Company’s results from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Revenue, net For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 Revenue $ 65,367 $ 61,977 Excise and cultivation taxes (563 ) (3,254 ) Revenue, net $ 64,804 $ 58,723 $ change $ 6,081 % change 10 % The increase in net revenue at June 30, 2022 as compared to June 30, 2021 was due to an increase in retail revenue of $25,586 from $22,393 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 to $47,979 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in revenue is mainly due to adult use sales in New Jersey which commenced during the three months ended June 30, 2022, as well as the acquisition of Gage (the ""Gage Acquisition"") in Michigan in March 2022. Retail dispensaries increased from thirteen at June 30, 2021 to twenty-six at June 30, 2022. The increase is partially offset by the decrease of $19,505 in wholesale revenue from $36,330 at June 30, 2021 to $16,825 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 which was mainly related to the operational reconfiguration of the Company's cultivation facility in Pennsylvania. Cost of Sales For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 Cost of sales $ 34,389 $ 23,773 Impairment and write downs of inventory 7,422 115 Total cost of sales $ 41,811 $ 23,888 $ change $ 17,923 % change 75 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 65 % 41 % The increase in cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021 was driven mainly by the Gage Acquisition, as well as an increase in New Jersey due to the increase in adult use sales which commenced during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was due to lower volumes in Pennsylvania leading to under-absorption, primarily related to lower wholesale flower sales, as well as operational challenges at the Company's cultivation facility in Frederick, Maryland as the Company transitions to its Hagerstown location. In addition, management wrote down its inventory by $7,422 and $115 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The inventory write-downs in the current year period were mainly due to the write down of inventory to lower of cost or market which was related to the aforementioned operational reconfiguration of its cultivation facility in Pennsylvania, write downs of inventory related to a recall by the Pennsylvania Department of Health of certain vape products produced by the Company, as well as inventory in Canada that the Company deemed unsaleable. On February 4, 2022, more than 500 vape products were recalled by the Pennsylvania's Department of Health, including several of the Company's SKUs. As a result of the recall, the Company wrote off $1,071 of inventory during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The inventory write-downs in the prior year period were related to inventory that the Company deemed unsaleable.

The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $47,845. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the purchase option derivative asset related to the option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership of the Company's New Jersey partnership, was remeasured using the Monte Carlo simulation model and resulted in a loss of $500. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized a loss on fair value of warrants of $19,891 as a result of the increase in the Company's share price from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021 as well as warrants exercised during the three months ended June 30, 2021.

At June 30, 2022, TerrAscend had cash and cash equivalents of $48,426, which is sufficient to fund the Company’s ongoing operations. Any additional future requirements will be funded through the following sources of capital: The Company’s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance its research and development activities, corporate and administration expenses, working capital and overall capital expenditures. Since inception, the Company has primarily financed its liquidity needs through the issuance of shares and utilization of borrowings.

The contingent consideration is revalued at the end of each reporting period. The Company expects that its cash on hand and cash flows from operations, along with financing transactions, will be adequate to meet its capital requirements and operational needs for at least the next 12 months. Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 Net cash used in operating activities $ (34,976 ) $ (10,076 ) The increase in cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022 is primarily due to an increase in loss from operations to $24,034 from a profit of $24,918 in the prior year period, as well as changes in working capital items of $16,081.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company's ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and the Company calculates Adjusted gross profit as gross profit adjusted for certain material non-cash items and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for material non-cash items and certain other adjustments management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes this definition is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of the Company's underlying business performance and other one-time non-recurring expenses. 32 The table below reconciles net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

The Company intends to rebrand each of the dispensaries under either the Gage or Cookies retail brand. This transaction is pending approval. Changes in or Adoption of Accounting Principles Information regarding the Company's adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Descriptions of the recently issued and adopted accounting principles are included in Item 1. ""Financial Statements"" in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company's future financial statements will be affected. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,"" included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed on March 17, 2022. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that the Company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more, or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30 th ; and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 34 There have been no material changes in the Company's primary risk exposures or management of market risks for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company's management, with the participation of its President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2022 the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the six months ended June 30, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. The Company is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings, including litigation related to intellectual property, product liability, employment, and commercial matters.

There have been no material changes to the Company's legal proceedings as previously disclosed in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2022. Item 1A . Risk Factors.

Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “expect”, “likely”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “potential”, “proposed”, “estimate” and other similar words, including negative and grammatical variations thereof, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” happen, or by discussions of strategy. Forward-looking statements include estimates, plans, expectations, opinions, forecasts, projections, targets, guidance, or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:  the performance of the Company’s business and operations;  the Company’s expectations regarding revenues, expenses and anticipated cash needs;  the competitive conditions of the industry;  federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the US relating to cannabis operations in the US; the legalization of the use of cannabis for medical and/or recreational use in the US and the related timing and impact thereof;  laws and regulations and any amendments thereto applicable to the business and the impact thereof;  the competitive advantages and business strategies of the Company;  the Company’s ability to source and operate facilities in the US;  the Company’s ability to integrate and operate the assets acquired from Arise Bioscience Inc.

Certain of the forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and the general expectations of the Company concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by the Company using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry. Such data is inherently imprecise. The cannabis industry involves risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various factors, which factors are described further below. With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which the Company operates; (iii) the output from the Company’s operations; (iv) consumer interest in the Company’s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of the Company’s activities and products and in the areas of taxation and environmental protection; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) the Company’s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; (x) the Company’s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner; and (xi) the Company’s construction plans and timeframe for completion of such plans. Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States relating to cannabis operations in the United States; and those discussed under Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The purpose of forward-looking statements is to provide the reader with a description of management’s expectations, and such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for any other purpose. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on the date such forward-looking statements are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, estimates or opinions, future events or results or otherwise or to explain any material difference between subsequent actual events and such forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement agreement, for each Gage subordinate voting share and other equity instruments, including outstanding stock options and warrants, each holder received a 0.3001 equivalent replacement award of the Company's respective security at the time of closing based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the Canadian Stock Exchange (""CSE"") on March 10, 2022. On the acquisition date there was consideration in the form of 51,349,978 Common Shares valued at $ 207,871 , 13,504,500 exchangeable units valued at $ 66,591 , 5,221,542 replacement stock options with a fair value of $ 13,147 , and 282,023 replacement warrants with a fair value of $ 435 .

As such, a restriction discount of $ 45,336 has been placed over the shares subject to lock-up. The fair value of the replacement options and warrants was calculated using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model combined with the percentage of the vesting period that was completed prior to the acquisition. Additionally, total consideration included warrant liabilities convertible into equity with a fair value of $ 6,756 . The following table presents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of March 10, 2022 acquisition date and allocation of the consideration to net assets acquired: TerrAscend Corp.

The fair value of the cultivation and processing and the retail licenses are $ 77,198 and $ 53,321 , respectively. In addition, the i ntangible assets include brand intangibles which are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets. The fair value of the brand intangibles is $ 57,435 . The consideration paid reflected the synergies, economies of scale, and workforce. These benefits were not recognized separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The accounting for this acquisition has been provisionally determined at March 31, 2022. The fair value of net assets acquired, specifically with respect to inventory, intangible assets, deferred revenue, property and equipment, operating right of use assets, lease liabilities, investments, corporate income taxes payable, deferred tax liability, and goodwill have been determined provisionally and are subject to adjustment. Upon completion of a comprehensive valuation and finalization of the purchase price allocation, the amounts above may be adjusted retrospectively to the acquisition date in future reporting periods. Costs related to this transaction were $ 3,353 , including legal, accounting, due diligence, and other transaction-related expenses. Of the total amount of transaction costs, $ 713 was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2022, and was included in transaction and restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. On a standalone basis, had the Company acquired the business on January 1, 2022, sales estimates would have been $ 23,950 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and net loss estimates would have been $ 17,116 . Actual sales and net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2022 since the date of acquisition are $ 11,434 and $ 7,905 , respectively. Contingent consideration Contingent consideration recorded relates to the Company’s business acquisitions. Contingent consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the terms of the agreement.

The seller then becomes the lessee and the buyer becomes the lessor. Under ASC 842, both parties must assess whether the buyer-lessor has obtained control of the asset and a sale has occurred. The Company's subsidiary Gage entered into leaseback transactions on five properties of owned real estate. The Company has determined that these transactions do not qualify as a sale because control was not transferred to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company has classified the lease portion of the transaction as a finance lease and continues to depreciate the asset. The Gage acquisition (refer to Note 4) included financing obligations in which the fair value of $ 12,184 . Of this amount, $ 580 is included in other current liabilities and $ 11,604 is included in financing obligations in the consolidated balance sheets.

The post-combination options vest over a 1- 3 year period. The fair value of the replacement options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: March 10, 2022 Volatility 55.0 %- 80.0 % Risk-free interest rate 1.22 %- 1.94 % Expected life (years) 2.00 - 5.00 Dividend yield 0 % The fair value of the various stock options granted were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Volatility 77.92 % 79.05 % - 81.51 % Risk-free interest rate 2.30 % 0.90 % - 1.72 % Expected life (years) 9.62 - 9.96 4.57 - 10.05 Dividend yield 0 % 0 % Forfeiture rate 23.73 % 23.21 % - 27.73 % The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between Company’s closing stock price on March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of the in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their in-the-money options on March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the exercise date and the price paid by the option holder to the exercise the option) related to stock options exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 61 and $ 3,077 respectively. The total estimated fair value of stock options that vested during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 2,511 and $ 2,994 , respectively. Volatility was estimated by using the historical volatility of the Company's stock price. The expected life in years represents the period of time that the options issued are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on US treasury bond issues with a remaining TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) term approximately equal to the expected life of the options.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) Geography The Company operates with subsidiaries located in Canada and the US. The Company had the following net revenue by geography of: For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 United States $ 48,593 $ 49,684 Canada 1,066 3,670 Total $ 49,659 $ 53,354 The Company had non-current assets by geography of: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 United States $ 819,696 $ 409,150 Canada 29,570 29,563 Total $ 849,266 $ 438,713 The Company’s objective in managing capital is to ensure a sufficient liquidity position to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order to achieve this objective, the Company prepares a capital budget to manage its capital structure. The Company defines capital as borrowings, equity comprised of issued share capital, share-based payments, accumulated deficit, as well as funds borrowed from related parties. Since inception, the Company has primarily financed its liquidity needs through the issuance of share capital through borrowings. The equity issuances are outlined in Note 11 and debt issuances are outlined in Note 8. The Company is subject to financial covenants as a result of its loans payable with various lenders. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants as of March 31, 2022. Other than these items related to loans payable as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Effective March 31, 2022, the Ilera term loan (refer to Note 8) was amended to provide the Company with greater flexibility, and the optional prepayment date was amended to 30 months (from 18 months ) from the closing date, subject to a premium payment due. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) The following table represents the fair value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis: At March 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 88,407 $ - — $ - $ 79,642 $ - — $ - Purchase option derivative asset — — 550 — — 868 Total Assets $ 88,407 $ - $ 550 $ 79,642 $ - $ 868 Liabilities Contingent consideration payable — $ - $ 5,700 $ - $ - $ 12,535 Warrant liability — 55,021 — — 54,986 — Total Liabilities $ - $ 55,021 $ 5,700 $ - $ 54,986 $ 12,535 There were no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within levels of the fair value hierarchy are presented below: Level 1 Cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans payable, convertible debentures, and other current receivables and payables represent financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. Level 2 Warrant liability The following table summarizes the changes in the warrant liability for the three months ended March 31, 2022: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 54,986 Addition on acquisition 6,756 Included in gain on fair value of warrants ( 6,031 ) Exercises ( 690 ) Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 55,021 The warrant liability has been measured at fair value at March 31, 2022. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation were as follows: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Common Stock Price of TerrAscend Corp. $ 5.70 $ 6.11 Warrant exercise price $ 3,000 $ 3,000 Warrant conversion ratio $ 1,000 $ 1,000 Annual volatility 60.9 % 65.5 % Annual risk-free rate 2.2 % 0.6 % Expected term (in years) 1.2 1.4 Level 3 Purchase option derivative asset The following table summarizes the changes in the purchase option derivative asset: TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 868 Revaluation of purchase option derivative asset ( 318 ) Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 550 The purchase option derivative asset has been measured at fair value at the transaction date using the Monte Carlo simulation model that relies on assumptions around the Company's EBITDA volatility and risk adjusted discount, among others. Key inputs and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model are summarized below: March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Term (in years) 1.2 1.3 Risk-free rate 1.4 % 0.4 % EBITDA discount rate 15.0 % 15.0 % EBITDA volatility 43.0 % 44.0 % Contingent Consideration Payable The fair value of contingent consideration at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was determined using a probability weighted model based on the likelihood of achieving certain revenue and EBITDA scenario outcomes. A discount rate of 12.2 % ( March 31, 2021 – 12.8 %) was utilized to determine the present value of the liabilities, resulting in a loss on revaluation of contingent consideration of $ 119 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 (March 31, 2021 - $ 2,997 ). The illustrative variance of the total contingent consideration at March 31, 2022 based on reasonably possible changes to one of the significant unobservable inputs, holding other inputs constant, would have the following effects: Discount rate sensitivity KCR Increase 100 basis points $ 1,139 Increase 50 basis points $ 1,160 Decrease 50 basis points $ 1,203 Decrease 100 basis points $ 1,225 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including litigation related to intellectual property, product liability, employment, and commercial matters. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. However, an unforeseen unfavorable development. At March 31, 2022 , there were no pending lawsuits other than those disclosed that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. TerrAscend Corp. Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts expressed in thousands of United States dollars, except for per share amounts) ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial information and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 17, 2022. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth under ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the following discussion and analysis. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of the financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend is for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 and the accompanying notes for each respective period. Business Overview TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, licensed cultivation and processing operations in Michigan and Maryland, and licensed processing operations in Canada. TerrAscend operates a chain of Apothecarium dispensary retail locations, as well as scaled cultivation, processing, and manufacturing facilities on both the east and west coasts of the United States. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent, high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use market. Notwithstanding various states in the US which have implemented medical marijuana laws, or which have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under US federal law for any purpose, by way of the CSA TerrAscend operates under one operating segment being the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products. TerrAscend’s portfolio of operating businesses and brands include: Results from Operations- Three months ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 The following tables represent the Company’s results from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Revenue, net For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Revenue $ 50,445 $ 56,496 Excise and cultivation taxes (786 ) (3,142 ) Revenue, net $ 49,659 $ 53,354 $ change $ (3,695 ) % change -7 % The decrease in net revenue at March 31, 2022 as compared to March 31, 2021 was due to a decrease in wholesale revenue of $14,443 from $38,384 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $23,941 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. This reduction in wholesale revenue was mainly related to a reset of the Company's cultivation facility in Pennsylvania and a recall by the Pennsylvania Department of Health of certain vape products produced by the Company. On February 4, 2022, more than 500 vape products were recalled by the Pennsylvania's Department of Health, including several of the Company's SKUs. As a result of the recall, the Company recorded sales returns of $1,040 during the three months ended March 31, 2022. In addition, the Company continued its intentional accumulation of inventory in New Jersey, versus selling wholesale, in preparation for adult use sales. This decrease is partially offset by an increase of $10,748 in retail sales from $14,970 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $25,718 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 which is primarily a result of the increase in retail dispensaries across Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey, as well as the acquisition of Gage (the ""Gage Acquisition"") in Michigan in March 2022. Retail dispensaries increased from nine in the first quarter of 2021 to twenty-five during the first quarter of 2022. Cost of Sales For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Cost of sales $ 33,446 $ 17,828 Impairment and write downs of inventory 1,073 584 Total cost of sales $ 34,519 $ 18,412 $ change $ 16,107 % change 87 % Cost of sales as a % of revenue 70 % 35 % The increase in cost of sales, as well as cost of sales as a percentage of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was driven mainly by lower volumes in Pennsylvania leading to under-absorption, primarily related to lower wholesale flower sales, as well as the aforementioned vape recall. As a result of the recall, the Company wrote off $854 of inventory. In addition, management wrote down its inventory by $219 and $584 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to inventory that it deemed unsaleable. General and Administrative Expense (G&A) For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 General and administrative expense $ 22,552 $ 20,392 $ change $ 2,160 % change 11 % G&A excluding share-based compensation $ 19,196 $ 16,825 G&A excluding share-based compensation as a % of revenue 39 % 32 % The increase in G&A expenses was primarily a result of increased salaries and wages of $1,637 and sales and marketing expense of $605, which is primarily a result of the Gage Acquisition in March 2022. Amortization and Depreciation Expense For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Amortization and depreciation $ 2,618 $ 1,873 $ change $ 745 % change 40 % The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 is primarily due to the Gage Acquisition during March 2022 as the Company recorded additional definite lived intangible assets of $130,519. Revaluation of contingent consideration For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Revaluation of contingent consideration $ 119 $ 2,997 $ change $ (2,878 ) % change -96 % The decrease in the revaluation of contingent consideration for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 is a result of a reduction in the liability as compared to March 31, 2021 due to payments for the earnout of Ilera of $29,668, and State Flower of $6,954 made subsequent to March 31, 2021, reducing the amount outstanding. This decrease is partially offset by the accretion of the contingent consideration payable for KCR, which are recorded at the present value of future payments upon initial recognition. (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset $ (5,713 ) $ 5,410 $ change $ (11,123 ) % change -206 % The Preferred Share warrant liability has been remeasured to fair value at March 31, 2022 using the Black Scholes model. The Company recognized a gain during the three months ended March 31, 2022 as a result of the reduction of the Company's share price from December 31, 2021 as compared to March 31, 2022, as well as from warrants exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The combined impact resulted in a gain on fair value of warrants of $7,208. Additionally, the Company remeasured the warrant liability acquired through the Gage Acquisition at March 31, 2022 using the Black Scholes model. The Company recognized a loss of $3,864 during the three months ended March 31, 2022 as a result of the increase in the Company's stock price at the acquisition date of March 10, 2022, as compared to March 31, 2022. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recognized a loss on fair value of warrants of $5,410 as a result of the increase in the Company's share price from December 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the purchase option derivative asset related to the option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership of the Company's New Jersey partnership, was remeasured using the Monte Carlo simulation model and resulted in a loss of $318. Finance and other expenses For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Finance and other expenses $ 6,856 $ 6,390 $ change $ 466 % change 7 % The increase in finance expense in the current period is primarily due to interest expense recognized on the loans acquired as part of the Gage Acquisition during March 2022. Transaction and restructuring costs For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Transaction and restructuring costs $ 615 $ - $ change $ 615 % change 100 % The increase in transaction and restructuring costs for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to the Gage Acquisition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 $ $ Cash and cash equivalents 88,407 79,642 Current assets 187,135 143,221 Non-current assets 849,266 438,713 Current liabilities 148,266 70,362 Non-current liabilities 362,896 282,618 Working capital 38,869 72,859 Total shareholders' equity 525,239 228,954 The calculation of working capital provides additional information and is not defined under GAAP. The Company defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any standardized measure under GAAP. At March 31, 2022, TerrAscend had cash and cash equivalents of $88,407, which is sufficient to fund the Company’s ongoing operations. Any additional future requirements will be funded through the following sources of capital: For additional information regarding regulatory and legal risks, please see Item 1A – “ Risk Factors ” in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed on March 17, 2022. The Company’s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance its research and development activities, corporate and administration expenses, working capital and overall capital expenditures. Since inception, the Company has primarily financed its liquidity needs through the issuance of shares and utilization of borrowings. The Company has $280,332 in principal amounts of loans payable at March 31, 2022. Of this amount, $59,490 are due within the next twelve months. The Company has entered into operating leases for certain premises and offices for which it owes monthly lease payments. In addition, the Company's undiscounted contingent consideration payable is $10,820 at March 31, 2022. The contingent consideration payable relates to the Company's business acquisitions of The Apothecarium, State Flower, and KCR. Contingent consideration is based upon the potential earnout of the underlying business unit and is measured at fair value using a projection model for the business and the formulaic structure for determining the consideration under the agreement. The contingent consideration is revalued at the end of each reporting period. The Company expects that its cash on hand and cash flows from operations, along with financing transactions, will be adequate to meet its capital requirements and operational needs for at least the next 12 months. Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (18,847 ) $ 6,212 The increase in cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 is primarily due to an increase in loss from operations to $10,030 from a profit of $12,677 in the prior year period, as well as a $5,276 increase in changes in working capital items. Cash flows from investing activities For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 13,913 $ (12,885 ) The net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily relates to the cash acquired through the Gage Acquisition of $24,716. The cash provided by investing activities is offset by investments in property and equipment of $4,193 primarily related to the buildout of a cultivation site in Maryland, continuing renovations at the Company's Pennsylvania cultivation site, as well as the continued buildout of the Company's Lodi alternative treatment center in New Jersey. In comparison, the cash outflow from investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily related to investments in property and equipment of $8,311 related to the buildout of the New Jersey operations and expansions in Pennsylvania cultivation and deposits of $4,826 paid for expansion of the cultivation premises in Pennsylvania. Cash flows from financing activities For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 17,068 $ 183,252 During the three months ended March 31, 2022, 7,989,436 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of $23,330 and 68,215 stock options were exercised at $1.93-$5.21 (C$2.42-$6.53) per unit for total gross proceeds of $192. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of State Flower of $6,630. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was mainly the result of the private placement on January 28, 2021, in which the Company issued 18,115,656 Common Shares at a price of $9.64 (C$12.35) per Common Share for total proceeds of $173,477, net of share issuance costs of $1,643. Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2021, 1,486,075 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of $3,854 and 381,820 stock options were exercised at $0.67-$6.34 (C$0.85-$8.09) per unit for total gross proceeds of $1,499. In addition, 1,570 preferred share warrants were exercised at $3,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of $3,735. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company's ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and the Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for material non-cash items and certain other adjustments management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes this definition is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of the Company's underlying business performance and other one-time non-recurring expenses. The table below reconciles net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. For the Three Months Ended Notes March 31, 2022 March 31, 2021 Net loss $ (16,006 ) $ (14,111 ) Add (deduct) the impact of: Provision for income taxes 3,743 9,436 Finance expenses 6,698 5,359 Amortization and depreciation 5,085 3,521 EBITDA (a) (480 ) 4,205 Add (deduct) the impact of: Relief of fair value upon acquisition (b) 1,806 — Vape recall (c) 1,894 — Share-based compensation (d) 3,356 3,567 Revaluation of contingent consideration (e) 119 2,997 Legal settlements (f) — 1,381 Other one-time items (g) 1,974 262 (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset (h) (5,713 ) 5,410 Indemnification asset release (i) (25 ) 1,197 Unrealized and realized loss (gain) on investments (j) - (228 ) Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss (k) 356 2,783 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,287 $ 21,574 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to lower volume and resulting gross margin compression in Pennsylvania related to the reset of the facility and associated reduction in the wholesale business. Pending and Subsequent Transactions On April 8, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Allegany Medical Marijuana Dispensary (""AMMD""), a medical dispensary in Maryland from Moose Curve Holdings, LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will acquire 100% equity interest in AMMD for total consideration of $10,000 in cash, in addition to acquiring the real estate for $1,700. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The Company intends to rebrand the 8,000 square foot dispensary as The Apothecarium. On April 14, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings, LLC (""Pinnacle""), a dispensary operator in Michigan, and related real estate, for total consideration of $28,500. The transaction includes six retail dispensary licenses, five of which are currently operational and located in the cities of Addison, Buchanan, Camden, Edmore, and Morenci. The Company intends to rebrand each of the dispensaries under either the Gage or Cookies retail brand. Changes in or Adoption of Accounting Principles Information regarding the Company's adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Descriptions of the recently issued and adopted accounting principles are included in Item 1. ""Financial Statements"" in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company's future financial statements will be affected. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,"" included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed on March 17, 2022. Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that the Company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more, or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30 th ; and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. There have been no material changes in the Company's primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2022 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. The Company is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings. Other than as noted below, TerrAscend believes that none of the litigation in which it is currently involved, or has been involved, in individually or in the aggregate, is material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. PharmHouse and 261 Matter On October 15, 2018, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary TerrAscend Canada entered into a multi-year cultivation agreement (the “PharmHouse Agreement”) with PharmHouse Inc. (“PharmHouse”), a joint venture between RIV Capital and 2615975 Ontario Inc., the operators of a leading North American greenhouse produce company (“261”). Under the terms of the PharmHouse Agreement, it was expected that PharmHouse would grow and supply cannabis to TerrAscend Canada from its existing 1.3 million square foot greenhouse located in Leamington, Ontario. Once fully licensed, the production of flower, trim and clones from up to 20% of the dedicated flowering space planted at the greenhouse was expected to be made available to TerrAscend Canada. To date, PharmHouse has not yet delivered product in accordance with the terms of the PharmHouse Agreement. On September 11, 2020, the Company and TerrAscend Canada were informed that a statement of claim was issued on August 31, 2020 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice by 261 against RIV Capital, Canopy Growth, the Company and TerrAscend Canada (the “261 Claim”). In the 261 Claim, 261 alleged the Company worked with the other defendants to bankrupt PharmHouse in order to avoid having to purchase certain products to be provided by PharmHouse under the PharmHouse Agreement. 261 sought damages from the defendants in the amount of C$500 million and alleged certain causes of action, including bad faith, fraud, civil conspiracy, breach of the duty of honesty and good faith in contractual relations and breach of fiduciary duty. On September 16, 2020, PharmHouse obtained an order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting PharmHouse creditor protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”). Pursuant to the CCAA order, the 261 Claim has been stayed. During a CCAA hearing in November, 261 objected to the stay of the 261 Claim. The judge presiding over the CCAA process agreed to allow 261 to discontinue the 261 Claim against the defendants “without prejudice” to its right to recommence the 261 Claim against all parties except PharmHouse Inc., provided that such recommenced claim can only be brought after January 1, 2021. This does not affect any of the defendants’ ability to move for a stay of the recommenced 261 Claim. On February 10, 2021, 261 served the Company and TerrAscend Canada with the recommenced 261 Claim. The recommenced 261 Claim contains the same factual allegations as the 261 Claim, the same legal claims and the same relief sought. On May 1, 2022, the Company received a full and final release from the 261 Claim. As a result, the Company will not accrue any contingencies with respect to the 261 Claim. Item 1A . Risk Factors. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. For a detailed discussion of the risks that affect our business, please refer to the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on March 17, 2022.
