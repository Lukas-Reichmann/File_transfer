Skyline Champion Corporation Date: December 28, 2023 By: /s/ Robert Spence Robert Spence Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary -;-EX-99.1: REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT December 31, 2022 CONTENTS DESCRIPTION PAGE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 1 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: 3 Consolidated Balance Sheet 3 Consolidated Statement of Income 5 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholder’s Equity 6 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 9 INDEPENDENT AUD ITOR’S REPORT To the Shareholder Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries Flowood, Mississippi Opinion We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholder’s equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore, - 1 - is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements, including omissions, are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we: We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit. /s/ Haddox Reid Eubank Betts PLLC Ridgeland, Mississippi May 18, 2023 -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business Regional Holdings Corporation (the Company) operations consist of retail, manufacturing, and leasing of manufactured homes, modular homes, and recreational vehicles primarily in the Southeastern United States. The Company also engages in commercial and recreational real estate investing. At December 31, 2022, the Company operated 43 home centers in Mississippi (19), Louisiana (8), Alabama (7), Florida (3), South Carolina (3), North Carolina (2), and Texas (1) and a 900+ manufactured housing unit lease portfolio. The Company’s manufacturing division consists of 4 facilities in northwest Alabama through a 33% interest. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company effectively purchased the other two thirds membership as disclosed further in Note 10. Retail The Company’s retail division operates primarily under the Regional Homes and Town & Country Homes brands (Regional Enterprises). In addition to the 43 home centers, it also conducts commercial operations. The commercial division of Retail supplies homes to various manufactured home communities, with locations stretching from Kansas to Florida. In support of the retail operations, the Company owns the commercial property on which several of its home centers operate and two commercial office buildings, including the Company’s headquarters located in Flowood, Mississippi. The Company also provides inventory floorplan financing to Regional Enterprises and various other independent dealers who purchase homes from the Company’s manufacturing division. The Company also performs last-mile delivery and setup for some of its home centers. Manufacturing The Company’s manufacturing division operates under the Hamilton Homebuilders and Winston Homebuilders brands and constructs factory-built manufactured and modular homes sold to the Company’s retail division, other independent home centers, and manufactured home communities. Hamilton Homebuilders produces a mid-range price point home while Winston Homebuilders produces a high-end product. The retail division of the Company accounted for 63% of production in 2022. The Company is a one-third (1/3) owner in the manufacturing division which is presented as an equity investment in the consolidated financial statements. Leasing The Company’s leasing division is engaged in the purchasing, leasing, and management of individual and commercial manufactured home residential rental units in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. The leasing division also includes a commercial real estate in Mississippi. Other Operations The Company engages in recreational real estate investing. These investments are typically held for 0-2 years and are sold to both individual and commercial customers. The Company is also a one-third (1/3) - 9 - REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 owner in an entity which owns and operates an aircraft used by Company management. The aircraft entity is presented as an equity investment in the consolidated financial statements. Basis of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regional Holdings Corporation and all majority-owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all checking accounts, undeposited cash and checks, and certificates of deposit with maturities of ninety days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable The Company’s receivables arise in the normal course of business and are accounted for under the reserve method whereby an allowance for doubtful accounts is utilized to reduce the receivables to the net realizable value. The allowance is based upon management’s review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. Receivables are charged to the allowance account when they are deemed to be uncollectible. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $335,000. Floor Plan Loans Receivable Generally, the majority of a mobile home dealership’s inventory is financed through a financing institution, such as is offered by the Company through one of its subsidiaries. That arrangement is often referred to as being floor planned and is covered by a written contract between the Company and the dealership that establishes the maximum that can be borrowed under the plan. Floor plan loans are secured by the dealership’s inventory and normally will be settled within a year as the related inventory is sold. The floor plan loans bear interest at effective rates that vary depending on the terms of each dealership's respective loan agreement(s). The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible loans that is maintained at a level that, in management’s opinion, is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio on an individual loan basis, including the nature of the portfolio, changes in its risk profile, credit concentrations, historical trends and existing economic conditions, as well as the balance of impaired loans. As of December 31, 2022, all floor plan loans receivables not eliminated through divisional or company consolidation were issued to third party borrowers, and the Company had no non- accrual loans, no impaired loans, and no allowance for loan losses. No concessions have been granted on repayment terms. - 10 - REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 Inventories Inventories of new and used manufactured or modular housing and recreational vehicles are valued using the specific cost identification method, not to exceed market values. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property, ranging from 5 to 39 years. Expenditures for renovations and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. At the time of retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations. Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of an internally developed enterprise resource planning system (ERP). ERP costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated period benefited, which is generally 5 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable assets acquired. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future cash flows of the business reporting segments to which the intangible relates. This evaluation is made annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Management of the Company has determined that no impairment losses exist as of December 31, 2022. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and amortizable intangible assets, whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. No impairment losses were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022. Long-lived assets expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of within one year are classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company had no assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2022. - 11 - REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 Investments in Affiliated Entities The Company’s investments in affiliated entities are accounted for under the equity method if the Company has the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliate’s operating and financial policies (generally defined as an ownership interest greater than twenty percent but not more than fifty percent of the affiliate). The investments in affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of undistributed earnings and losses. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has received for those goods or services. The Company’s Retail operation recognizes revenues when products are available for customer possession and substantially all proceeds related to the sale are received or upon the satisfaction of all contractual obligations. The performance obligations related to these services are considered satisfied at the time the products are available for customer possession or upon the satisfaction of all contractual obligations. Any performance obligations related to warranties and repairs are the responsibility of the manufacturers and not the Company. Revenues from rentals are recorded as they accrue. Land sales are recorded at the time the title and risk of ownership pass. Customer Deposits Customer deposits for the Retail division of the Company are down payments received from a customer for the purchase of a manufactured or modular home. Once the home is delivered to the customer’s site and the sale is finalized, the deposit is recognized as revenue. Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02 “Leases” (Topic 842), which increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value at the future minimum lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date plus any option periods that are probable of being exercised at the lease inception. Lease assets are recognized at the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made, less any lease incentives received. After the commencement date, lease cost for an operating lease is recognized over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. The accounting applied by a lessor is substantially equivalent to the previous guidance. Topic 842 requires entities to use a modified retrospective transition method. The Company elected to apply the effective date adoption method with an effective date of January 1, 2022, and has elected to use the available package of practical expedients. There was no impact to retained earnings as a result of the adoption. The recognized balance of the ROU assets and liabilities were approximately $3,000,000 as of the effective date. - 12 - REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. If an arrangement is considered a lease, the Company determines at the commencement date whether the lease is an operating or finance lease. The Company only has operating leases and therefore, after the commencement date, lease cost for an operating lease is recognized over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. The Company has made a policy election to classify leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less as short-term leases, and these leases are not recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets unless the lease contains a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease cost related to short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Income Taxes The Company has elected to be taxed as a “small business corporation” under federal and state statutes and is therefore, not subject to federal and state income taxes and is considered a partnership for income tax purposes. The shareholder is liable for individual federal and state income taxes on his respective portions of the Company’s taxable income. Management does not anticipate any adjustments from any tax authorities that would result in a material change to the Company’s financial position. The Company has not recognized a provision for any unrecognized tax benefits, or interest or penalties thereon, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 3 - INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED ENTITIES The Company’s ownership interest in these affiliated entities is comprised of the following as of December 31, 2022 Hamilton Home Builders and Affiliates 33 % Aviation Group, LLC 33 % The summarized financial position, results of operations and composition of the Company’s total investment in these affiliated entities as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended are as follows: Hamilton Home Builders and Affiliates Aviation Group Total Combined entities: Assets $ 89,366,674 $ 836,330 $ 90,203,004 Liabilities 32,837,465 - 32,837,465 Shareholder's equity 56,529,209 836,330 57,365,539 Revenue 327,799,000 73,621 327,872,621 Net income 45,430,978 (429,605 ) 45,001,373 Company's investment: Shareholder's equity 13,929,094 220,149 14,149,243 Net income 13,056,931 (274,778 ) 12,782,153 The Company purchases certain inventories from its related manufacturing activities, Hamilton Homebuilders and Winston Homebuilders (Manufacturing). Manufacturing sells these inventories to the Company at market prices and recognizes gross profit on these sales. Inventories held by the Company at December 31, 2022 include purchases from Manufacturing, for which the Company’s share of Manufacturing’s gross profit is not realized until sold to an unrelated party.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Review Results We conducted our review in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) applicable to reviews of interim financial information. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. A review of interim financial information is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, the objective of which is an expression of an opinion regarding the financial information as a whole, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. We are required to be independent of Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our review. We believe that the results of the review procedures provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion. Responsibilities of Management for the Interim Financial Information Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of interim financial information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. /s/ BMSS, LLC Ridgeland, Mississippi December 28, 2023 -

7 - NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business Regional Holdings Corporation (the Company) operations consist of retail, manufacturing, and leasing of manufactured homes, modular homes, and recreational vehicles primarily in the Southeastern United States. The Company also engages in commercial and recreational real estate investing. As of June 30, 2023, the Company operated 43 home centers in Mississippi (19), Louisiana (8), Alabama (7), Florida (3), South Carolina (3), North Carolina (2), and Texas (1) and a 900+ manufactured housing unit lease portfolio. The Company’s manufacturing division consists of 4 facilities in northwest Alabama. Retail The Company’s retail division operates primarily under the Regional Homes and Town & Country Homes brands (Regional Enterprises). In addition to the 43 home centers, it also conducts both governmental and commercial operations. The commercial division of Retail supplies homes to various manufactured home communities, with locations stretching from Kansas to Florida. In support of the retail operations, the Company owns the commercial property on which several of its home centers operate and two commercial office buildings, including the Company’s headquarters located in Flowood, Mississippi. The Company also provides inventory floorplan financing to various independent dealers who purchase homes from the Company’s manufacturing division. The Company also performs last-mile delivery and setup for some of its home centers. Manufacturing The Company’s manufacturing division operates under the Hamilton Homebuilders and Winston Homebuilders brands and constructs factory-built manufactured and modular homes sold to the Company’s retail division, other independent home centers, and manufactured home communities. Hamilton Homebuilders produces a mid-range price point home while Winston Homebuilders produces a high-end product. The retail division of the Company accounted for 76% of production for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Leasing The Company’s leasing division is engaged in the purchasing, leasing, and management of individual and commercial manufactured home residential rental units in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. The leasing division also includes commercial real estate in Mississippi. Other Operations The Company engages in recreational real estate investing. These investments are typically held for 0-2 years and are sold to both individual and commercial customers. The Company is also a one-third (1/3) owner in an entity which owns and operates an aircraft used by Company management. The aircraft entity is presented as an equity investment in the consolidated financial statements. Basis of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles accepted in the United States of America. The - 8 - consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regional Holdings Corporation and all majority-owned subsidiaries as of June 30, 2023. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and independent auditor's report as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all checking accounts, undeposited cash and checks, and certificates of deposit with maturities of ninety days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions, and, at times, balances may exceed Federally insured limits. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances. Notes Receivable The Company has notes receivable predominantly related to New Market Tax Credit (''NMTC'') (See Note 6) and retail. The note receivable related to NMTC is collateralized by a limited liability company membership interest and is stated at the principal amount. Management assesses the credit quality of the notes receivable based on indicators such as collection experience as well as collateralization in relation to the NMTC note receivable. There was no allowance on notes receivable recorded as of June 30, 2023. Accounts Receivable The Company’s receivables arise in the normal course of business and are accounted for under the reserve method whereby an allowance for doubtful accounts is utilized to reduce the receivables to the net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (""ASU"") 2016-13, ""Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which replaced the existing incurred credit loss model with the current expected credit loss model (""CECL""). The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company's allowance for credit losses reflects management's estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of the receivables and is based upon management’s review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. Receivables are charged to the allowance account when they are deemed to be uncollectible. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had allowance for doubtful accounts of $335,000. On a continuing basis, management analyzes delinquent receivables and, once these receivables are determined to be uncollectible, they are written off through a charge against an existing allowance account or against earnings. Floor Plan Loans Receivable Generally, the majority of a mobile home dealership’s inventory is financed through a financing institution, such as is offered by the Company through one of its subsidiaries. That arrangement is often referred to as being floor planned and is covered by a written contract between the Company and the dealership that establishes the maximum that can be borrowed under the plan. Floor plan loans are secured by the dealership’s inventory and normally will be settled within a year as the related inventory is sold. The floor plan loans bear interest at effective rates that vary depending on the terms of each dealership's respective loan agreement(s). The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible loans that is maintained at a level that, in management’s opinion, is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the - 9 - allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio on an individual loan basis, including the nature of the portfolio, changes in its risk profile, credit concentrations, historical trends and existing economic conditions, as well as the balance of impaired loans. As of June 30, 2023, all floor plan loans receivables not eliminated through divisional or company consolidation were issued to third party borrowers, and the Company had no non- accrual loans, no impaired loans, and no allowance for loan losses. No concessions have been granted on repayment terms. Inventories Inventories of new and used manufactured or modular housing and recreational vehicles are valued using the specific cost identification method, not to exceed market values. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of inventories is computed by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories consisted of the following as at June 30, 2023: June 30, 2023 Raw materials $ 12,431,373 Work in process 1,443,516 Finished goods 149,574,514 $ 163,449,403 At June 30, 2023 reserves for obsolete inventory were immaterial. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property, ranging from 5 to 40 years. Expenditures for renovations and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. At the time of retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations. Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of an internally developed enterprise resource planning system (ERP), customer relationships and trade names. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated period benefited, which is generally 5 years for ERP and 10 years for customer relationships and trade names. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future cash flows of the business reporting units to which the intangible relates. This evaluation is made annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Management of the Company has determined that no impairment losses exist as of June 30, 2023. At June 30, 2023, there are no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill. - 10 - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and amortizable intangible assets whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. No impairment losses were recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2023. Long-lived assets expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of within one year are classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company had no assets classified as held for sale at June 30, 2023. Investments in Affiliated Entities The Company’s investments in affiliated entities are accounted for under the equity method if the Company has the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliate’s operating and financial policies (generally defined as an ownership interest greater than twenty percent but not more than fifty percent of the affiliate). The investments in affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of undistributed earnings and losses. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has received for those goods or services. The Company’s Retail operation recognizes revenues when products are available for customer possession and substantially all proceeds related to the sale are received or upon satisfaction of all contractual obligations. The performance obligations related to these services are considered satisfied at the time the products are available for customer possession or upon the satisfaction of all contractual obligations. The Company's manufacturing division records revenue when the related product has shipped. Revenues from rentals are recorded as they accrue. Land sales are recorded at the time the title and risk of ownership pass. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in contracts with customers. The nature of the Company's business gives rise to variable considerations, which are discussed in the following paragraphs. A single customer represented 19% of the Company’s net home sales and 87% of the Company's accounts receivable as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2023. - 11 - Customer Deposits Customer deposits are down payments received from a customer for the purchase of a manufactured or modular home. Once the home is delivered to the customer’s site and the sale is finalized, the deposit is recognized as revenue. Warranties The manufacturing division provides a warranty for a period of one year from the date of retail sale that the product complies with agreed upon specifications. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. The Company maintains a liability of estimated warranty costs based on historical experience. Changes in accrued warranty obligations were as follows: June 30, 2023 Balance at beginning of period $ 8,953,000 Warranty expense 7,452,000 Cash warranty payments (6,759,229 ) Balance at end of period $ 9,645,771 Debt Issuance Costs The Company has incurred debt issuance costs totaling $774,255 related to debt outstanding as of June 30, 2023. These costs were capitalized and are expensed over the term of the related debt agreements. Accumulated amortization totaled $352,561 as at June 30, 2023. Amortization expense of the debt issuance cost totaled $35,986 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Debt issuance costs are shown as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt. Income Taxes The Company has elected to be taxed as a “small business corporation” under federal and state statutes and is therefore, not subject to federal and state income taxes and is considered a partnership for income tax purposes. The shareholder is liable for individual federal and state income taxes on his respective portions of the Company’s taxable income. Management does not anticipate any adjustments from any tax authorities that would result in a material change to the Company’s financial position. The Company has not recognized a provision for any unrecognized tax benefits, or interest or penalties thereon, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. - 12 - NOTE 2 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consisted of the following as of June 30, 2023: June 30, 2023 Land $ 36,825,806 Buildings/Office units 94,806,713 Vehicles and equipment 2,018,379 133,650,898 Less accumulated depreciation (21,144,800 ) $ 112,506,098 Depreciation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was $2,774,480. NOTE 3 - INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED ENTITIES As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a one-third ownership interest in Hamilton Homebuilders, LLC and Affiliates (“Hamilton”). Effective January 1, 2023, the Company gained control of Hamilton when the remaining two-thirds membership interests were redeemed via $10,000,000 cash payment and $20,000,000 promissory notes entered into between Hamilton and the selling members. Prior to the redemption, the Company’s investment in Hamilton was accounted for under the equity method. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination achieved without the transfer of consideration, and accordingly, the acquisition date fair value of the Company’s interest in Hamilton was substituted for the acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred to measure Goodwill. The enterprise value of Hamilton was determined to be $216.9 million based upon an independent appraisal resulting in a gain on consolidation of Hamilton of $153.0 million, which includes a gain of $58.4 million from the remeasurement of the Company’s one-third ownership interest to fair value as of January 1, 2023. A preliminary summary of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction is shown below: Cash $ 29,922,151 Trade receivables 4,214,358 Inventory 22,457,127 Property, plant and equipment 27,336,318 Other assets 7,578,699 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (26,701,716 ) Long-term debt (36,012,105 ) Intangibles 19,900,000 Goodwill 122,146,064 $ 170,840,895 Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce, expected synergies, and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate recognition. Intangible assets include $16.0 million in customer relationships and $3.9 million associated with trade names and were based on an independent appraisal related to the Company's subsequent events. The fair value of the customer relationships was determined using the - 13 - multi-period excess earnings method and the fair value of the trade name was determined using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company estimates that each intangible asset has a weighted average useful life of ten years from the acquisition date. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on preliminary estimates using currently available information. The final fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations could materially differ from these preliminary estimates.

The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2023. Cash outlays for interest amounted to $7,213,144 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Approximate maturities of long-term debt for the years subsequent to June 30, 2023, are as follows: 2024 $ 61,415,505 2025 56,562,125 2026 17,607,350 2027 47,760,106 2028 2,397,246 Thereafter 52,327,564 $ 238,069,896 On September 4, 2019, Hamilton entered into a New Market Tax Credit (""NMTC"") financing transaction to pay off existing debt and partially fund capital improvements. As part of this transaction, Liberty NMTC, LCC (''Liberty'') was formed and entered into a source loan and security agreement with United Bank of Alabama. The proceeds of the source loan were used to fund Liberty's loan to the HHB Investment Fund LLC (""Investment""), an unrelated party. Investment's sole investor, Wells Fargo Community Investment Holdings Inc. (""WFC""), contributed capital to Investment. WFC's contribution which represents its purchase of the tax credits through Investment's subsidiary, Romeo Juliet, LLC (""RJ""). A summary of the proceeds received by RJ follows: Liberty's note proceeds $ 5,313,750 WFC capital contribution 2,486,250 Professional fees (450,000 ) $ 7,350,000 Hamilton entered into the following note agreements with RJ: Note A $ 5,313,750 Note B 2,036,250 $ 7,350,000 There is a put and call agreement between Hamilton and WFC. If WFC does not exercise their put option, Hamilton has the ability to call the ownership in the interest in the Investment for fair market value. It is anticipated that WFC will put their option and Hamilton will own the Investment at the end of the compliance period. However, if WFC does not put their interest, management plans to exercise its option to call. By acquiring the ownership interest, Hamilton will be in a position whereby it can forgive the NMTC notes payable, resulting in the elimination of $7,350,000 in outstanding debt at that point in time and recognize the benefits from the NMTC program. In turn, it is expected that Liberty would forgive the NMTC $5,313,750 note receivable described in Note 6. - 15 - NOTE 5 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS The components of intangible assets are as follows: Customer Relationships & Other Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 17,101,982 $ 3,900,000 $ 21,001,982 Accumulated amortization (1,109,624 ) (195,000 ) $ (1,304,624 ) Amortizable Intangibles, net $ 15,992,358 $ 3,705,000 $ 19,697,358 Weighted average remaining amortization period, in years 9.4 Amortization of intangible assets was $1,092,685 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

The balance on June 30, 2023 was $5,313,750. The interest income on the note receivable was $193,624 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES The Company warrants its products for a period of one year from the date of retail sale by a dealer. These financial statements include estimated liabilities for the cost of such warranties. Although the estimates are based on management's best judgments, actual cash settlements of warranty claims will likely vary from estimated liabilities accrued. The Company has pending legal claims incurred in the normal course of business. The Company also has pending legal claims regarding the purchase of the remaining two thirds of Hamilton. The claims, in the opinion of management, can be disposed of without material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. NOTE 8 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company utilizes two captive insurers, Regional Underwriters, Inc. and JC Underwriters, Inc. to insure various aspects of the Company’s operations. A captive insurer is generally defined as an insurance company that is wholly owned and controlled by its insureds to insure the risk of its owners and insureds. The captive insurers and the Company have common owners. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company - 16 - paid and expensed insurance premiums totaling $2,175,720 to these related party captives for insurance against uninsured or underinsured properties. NOTE 9- REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS The Company has entered into repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide financing to dealers that market the Company's products. Generally, the agreements provide for the repurchase of the manufactured homes from the lenders in the event of a repossession of a dealer's inventory upon default. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase. At June 30, 2023, the total amount under repurchase to lending institutions under these repurchase agreements was $18,600,000. The Company has not recorded a loss reserve for repurchase agreements as of June 30, 2023.

The purchase price, as defined in the purchase agreement, was $428.0 million, plus cash acquired, less assumed indebtedness, plus an earnout provision and an aggregate number of shares of Skyline Champion stock equal to approximately $30.0 million. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through December 28, 2023, the date the financial statements were approved by management and thereby available to be issued and except as discussed above has determined that there are no subsequent events of a material nature requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. - 17 - -;-EX-99.3:UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements (“pro forma financial statements”) have been prepared based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Skyline Champion Corporation (“Skyline Champion”, the ""Company”) to give effect to the following transaction (the “Transaction”): On August 25, 2023, Champion Home Builders (“CHB”) and Champion Retail Housing (together with CHB, the “Buyers”), subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Regional Holdings Corporation (“Regional Holdings”), Regional Underwriters, Inc.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying pro forma financial statements were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, as amended, including pursuant to SEC Final Rule, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, release number 33-10786 dated May 20, 2020 (“Article 11”), using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP. Transaction accounting adjustments have been made to show the effects of the Transaction on the historical financial statements of Skyline Champion and Regional Homes. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based on estimates of the purchase consideration and estimates of fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical financial statements of Regional Homes in order to conform with classifications used by Skyline Champion. Skyline Champion's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Regional Homes fiscal year ends December 31. Pursuant to Regulation S-X for companies with different fiscal year ends, the pro forma financial information has been prepared utilizing periods that differ by one quarter. As such, Skyline Champion's historical results for the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are derived from the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023, unaudited consolidated income statement for the six months ended September 30, 2023, and audited consolidated income statement for the year ended April 1, 2023. Regional Homes' historical results are derived from Regional Homes' unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023, unaudited consolidated income statement for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and audited consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022. Note 2. Acquisition of Regional Homes On August 25, 2023, Champion Home Builders (“CHB”) and Champion Retail Housing (together with CHB, the “Buyers”), subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Regional Holdings Corporation (“Regional”), Regional Underwriters, Inc. (“Regional Underwriters”), Heath Jenkins, as beneficial owner of the outstanding equity interests of Regional (collectively, with Regional and the Regional Underwriters, the “Sellers”), Dana Jenkins, as beneficial owner of the outstanding equity interests of Helicon Insurance, LLC, and party thereto solely with respect to the sale of Helicon Insurance, LLC (“Dana Jenkins”), and Heath Jenkins, solely in his capacity as the representative of the Sellers (the “Sellers’ Representative”), pursuant to which Buyers agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in Regional Enterprises, LLC and related companies (collectively, “Regional Homes”). On October 13, 2023 (the ""Closing Date""), the Company, through the Buyers, paid to Sellers approximately $317 million and assumed debt, primarily related to inventory floor plan liabilities, of approximately $93 million. In addition, the Company issued 379,248 shares of common stock in Skyline Champion, par value $0.0277 per share (the “Skyline Common Stock”), equal to approximately $23 million, to Sellers. The transaction is subject to an earnout provision as well as customary net working capital adjustments. The Company also issued 75,850 shares of Skyline Common Stock, equal to approximately $5 million, to Dana Jenkins (the “D. Jenkins Stock Consideration”) for Helicon Insurance, LLC. The Skyline Champion Common Stock was issued to the Sellers and Dana Jenkins in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act (the “Private Placement”). Note 3. Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation The allocation of the preliminary estimated purchase price is based upon Skyline Champion’s estimates of and assumptions related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of September 30, 2023, using currently available information. Because the pro forma financial statements have been prepared based on these preliminary estimates, the final purchase price allocation and the resulting effect on Skyline Champion’s financial position and results of operations may materially differ from the pro forma amounts included in this filing. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to adjustment as the purchase accounting is not finalized.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Regional Holdings Corporation and subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore, - 1 - is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements, including omissions, are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we: We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit. /s/ Haddox Reid Eubank Betts PLLC Ridgeland, Mississippi May 18, 2023 -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business Regional Holdings Corporation (the Company) operations consist of retail, manufacturing, and leasing of manufactured homes, modular homes, and recreational vehicles primarily in the Southeastern United States. The Company also engages in commercial and recreational real estate investing. At December 31, 2022, the Company operated 43 home centers in Mississippi (19), Louisiana (8), Alabama (7), Florida (3), South Carolina (3), North Carolina (2), and Texas (1) and a 900+ manufactured housing unit lease portfolio. The Company’s manufacturing division consists of 4 facilities in northwest Alabama through a 33% interest. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company effectively purchased the other two thirds membership as disclosed further in Note 10. Retail The Company’s retail division operates primarily under the Regional Homes and Town & Country Homes brands (Regional Enterprises). In addition to the 43 home centers, it also conducts commercial operations. The commercial division of Retail supplies homes to various manufactured home communities, with locations stretching from Kansas to Florida. In support of the retail operations, the Company owns the commercial property on which several of its home centers operate and two commercial office buildings, including the Company’s headquarters located in Flowood, Mississippi. The Company also provides inventory floorplan financing to Regional Enterprises and various other independent dealers who purchase homes from the Company’s manufacturing division. The Company also performs last-mile delivery and setup for some of its home centers. Manufacturing The Company’s manufacturing division operates under the Hamilton Homebuilders and Winston Homebuilders brands and constructs factory-built manufactured and modular homes sold to the Company’s retail division, other independent home centers, and manufactured home communities. Hamilton Homebuilders produces a mid-range price point home while Winston Homebuilders produces a high-end product. The retail division of the Company accounted for 63% of production in 2022. The Company is a one-third (1/3) owner in the manufacturing division which is presented as an equity investment in the consolidated financial statements. Leasing The Company’s leasing division is engaged in the purchasing, leasing, and management of individual and commercial manufactured home residential rental units in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. The leasing division also includes a commercial real estate in Mississippi. Other Operations The Company engages in recreational real estate investing. These investments are typically held for 0-2 years and are sold to both individual and commercial customers. The Company is also a one-third (1/3) - 9 - REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 owner in an entity which owns and operates an aircraft used by Company management. The aircraft entity is presented as an equity investment in the consolidated financial statements. Basis of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regional Holdings Corporation and all majority-owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all checking accounts, undeposited cash and checks, and certificates of deposit with maturities of ninety days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable The Company’s receivables arise in the normal course of business and are accounted for under the reserve method whereby an allowance for doubtful accounts is utilized to reduce the receivables to the net realizable value. The allowance is based upon management’s review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. Receivables are charged to the allowance account when they are deemed to be uncollectible. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $335,000. Floor Plan Loans Receivable Generally, the majority of a mobile home dealership’s inventory is financed through a financing institution, such as is offered by the Company through one of its subsidiaries. That arrangement is often referred to as being floor planned and is covered by a written contract between the Company and the dealership that establishes the maximum that can be borrowed under the plan. Floor plan loans are secured by the dealership’s inventory and normally will be settled within a year as the related inventory is sold. The floor plan loans bear interest at effective rates that vary depending on the terms of each dealership's respective loan agreement(s). The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible loans that is maintained at a level that, in management’s opinion, is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio on an individual loan basis, including the nature of the portfolio, changes in its risk profile, credit concentrations, historical trends and existing economic conditions, as well as the balance of impaired loans. As of December 31, 2022, all floor plan loans receivables not eliminated through divisional or company consolidation were issued to third party borrowers, and the Company had no non- accrual loans, no impaired loans, and no allowance for loan losses. No concessions have been granted on repayment terms. - 10 - REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 Inventories Inventories of new and used manufactured or modular housing and recreational vehicles are valued using the specific cost identification method, not to exceed market values. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property, ranging from 5 to 39 years. Expenditures for renovations and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. At the time of retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations. Intangible Assets Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of an internally developed enterprise resource planning system (ERP). ERP costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated period benefited, which is generally 5 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable assets acquired. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future cash flows of the business reporting segments to which the intangible relates. This evaluation is made annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Management of the Company has determined that no impairment losses exist as of December 31, 2022. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and amortizable intangible assets, whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. No impairment losses were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022. Long-lived assets expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of within one year are classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company had no assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2022. - 11 - REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 Investments in Affiliated Entities The Company’s investments in affiliated entities are accounted for under the equity method if the Company has the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliate’s operating and financial policies (generally defined as an ownership interest greater than twenty percent but not more than fifty percent of the affiliate). The investments in affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of undistributed earnings and losses. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has received for those goods or services. The Company’s Retail operation recognizes revenues when products are available for customer possession and substantially all proceeds related to the sale are received or upon the satisfaction of all contractual obligations. The performance obligations related to these services are considered satisfied at the time the products are available for customer possession or upon the satisfaction of all contractual obligations. Any performance obligations related to warranties and repairs are the responsibility of the manufacturers and not the Company. Revenues from rentals are recorded as they accrue. Land sales are recorded at the time the title and risk of ownership pass. Customer Deposits Customer deposits for the Retail division of the Company are down payments received from a customer for the purchase of a manufactured or modular home. Once the home is delivered to the customer’s site and the sale is finalized, the deposit is recognized as revenue. Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02 “Leases” (Topic 842), which increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value at the future minimum lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date plus any option periods that are probable of being exercised at the lease inception. Lease assets are recognized at the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made, less any lease incentives received. After the commencement date, lease cost for an operating lease is recognized over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. The accounting applied by a lessor is substantially equivalent to the previous guidance. Topic 842 requires entities to use a modified retrospective transition method. The Company elected to apply the effective date adoption method with an effective date of January 1, 2022, and has elected to use the available package of practical expedients. There was no impact to retained earnings as a result of the adoption. The recognized balance of the ROU assets and liabilities were approximately $3,000,000 as of the effective date. - 12 - REGIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022 The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. If an arrangement is considered a lease, the Company determines at the commencement date whether the lease is an operating or finance lease. The Company only has operating leases and therefore, after the commencement date, lease cost for an operating lease is recognized over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. The Company has made a policy election to classify leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less as short-term leases, and these leases are not recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets unless the lease contains a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease cost related to short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Income Taxes The Company has elected to be taxed as a “small business corporation” under federal and state statutes and is therefore, not subject to federal and state income taxes and is considered a partnership for income tax purposes. The shareholder is liable for individual federal and state income taxes on his respective portions of the Company’s taxable income. Management does not anticipate any adjustments from any tax authorities that would result in a material change to the Company’s financial position. The Company has not recognized a provision for any unrecognized tax benefits, or interest or penalties thereon, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.

Skyline Champion Corporation Date: October 31, 2023 By: /s/ Robert Spence Robert Spence Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary -;-EX-99.1: SKYLINE CHAMPION ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2024 RESULTS Troy, Michigan, October 31, 2023 /Business Wire/ -- Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE: SKY) (“Skyline Champion”) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended September 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2024”). Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Highlights (compared to Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 unless otherwise noted) “Skyline Champion continued to demonstrate our commitment to the customer and our ability to execute our strategy in an evolving economic environment,” said Mark Yost, Skyline Champion’s President, and Chief Executive Officer. “We continued to see a healthy increase in order volumes sequentially. In addition, we have recently closed two transformational strategic opportunities - our investment in ECN Capital including the formation of Champion Financing, and the acquisition of Regional Homes. We are excited by these new developments and remain confident that execution of our strategic initiatives will continue to position us to better serve our customers for years to come.” Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results Net sales for the second quarter fiscal 2024 decreased 42.5% to $464.2 million compared to the prior-year period. The number of U.S. homes sold in the second quarter fiscal 2024 decreased 33.4% to 4,842. The lower volume output compared to the prior year period primarily reflects the decrease in order volumes from the larger community REITs as well as the absence of FEMA-related sales which totaled $117.8 million last year. The ASP per U.S. home sold decreased 14.8% to $88,400. The decline in ASPs is a result of higher-priced FEMA unit sales in the prior-year period, changes to core product mix, and a decrease in material surcharges. The number of Canadian factory-built homes sold in the quarter decreased to 232 homes compared to 303 homes in the prior-year period due to the higher interest rate environment and softening demand. Gross profit decreased by 57.5% to $116.5 million in the second quarter fiscal 2024 compared to the prior-year period. Gross profit margin was 25.1% of net sales, a contraction of 890 basis points compared to 34.0% in the second quarter fiscal 2023. The change in gross profit margin was driven by lower ASPs due to the higher-priced FEMA unit sales in the prior-year period and a shift in product mix to homes with fewer options. Gross margins were also impacted by softer demand and recently opened plants. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the second quarter fiscal 2024 decreased to $64.5 million from $83.9 million in the same period last year. SG&A during the quarter decreased due to less variable compensation expense from lower sales volumes. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 13.9%, compared to 10.4% in the prior year period. Net income decreased by 68.3% to $45.7 million for the second quarter fiscal 2024 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in net income was driven by lower sales and gross profit in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter fiscal 2024 decreased by 70.2% to $58.8 million compared to the second quarter fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 12.7%, compared to 24.4% in the prior-year period. As of September 30, 2023, Skyline Champion had $701.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $96.6 million in the current quarter, due to the strategic investment in ECN Capital partially offset by cash flows from operations.

About Skyline Champion Corporation: Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE: SKY) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in North America and employs approximately 8,600 people subsequent to the closing of the acquisition of Regional Homes in October 2023. With more than 70 years of homebuilding experience and 47 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States and western Canada, Skyline Champion is well positioned with an innovative portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, ADUs, park-models and modular buildings for the single-family, multi-family, and hospitality sectors. In addition to its core home building business, Skyline Champion provides construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes, operates a factory-direct retail business with 74 retail locations across the United States, and operates Star Fleet Trucking, providing transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States. Skyline Champion builds homes under some of the most well-known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Regional Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) throughout this press release, Skyline Champion has provided non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, which present operating results on a basis adjusted for certain items. Skyline Champion uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. Skyline Champion believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess its operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that Skyline Champion believes are not representative of its core business. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace, and should not be considered superior to, the presentation of Skyline Champion’s financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Skyline Champion defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus expenses or minus income, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest income or expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, (f) other non-operating income and costs, including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP. Skyline Champion believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, Skyline Champion’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled from the respective measure under U.S. GAAP in the tables below. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales reported in the statement of operations. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is calculated as net income or loss plus (a) equity-based compensation awards granted before December 31, 2018, (b) restructuring charges, (c) impairment of assets, and (d) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration of businesses, including the related tax effect, if any, on these items.

Skyline Champion Corporation Date: October 31, 2023 By: /s/ Robert Spence Robert Spence Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary ","EX-99.1: SKYLINE CHAMPION ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2024 RESULTS Troy, Michigan, October 31, 2023 /Business Wire/ -- Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE: SKY) (“Skyline Champion”) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended September 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2024”). Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Highlights (compared to Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 unless otherwise noted) “Skyline Champion continued to demonstrate our commitment to the customer and our ability to execute our strategy in an evolving economic environment,” said Mark Yost, Skyline Champion’s President, and Chief Executive Officer. “We continued to see a healthy increase in order volumes sequentially. In addition, we have recently closed two transformational strategic opportunities - our investment in ECN Capital including the formation of Champion Financing, and the acquisition of Regional Homes. We are excited by these new developments and remain confident that execution of our strategic initiatives will continue to position us to better serve our customers for years to come.” Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results Net sales for the second quarter fiscal 2024 decreased 42.5% to $464.2 million compared to the prior-year period. The number of U.S. homes sold in the second quarter fiscal 2024 decreased 33.4% to 4,842. The lower volume output compared to the prior year period primarily reflects the decrease in order volumes from the larger community REITs as well as the absence of FEMA-related sales which totaled $117.8 million last year. The ASP per U.S. home sold decreased 14.8% to $88,400. The decline in ASPs is a result of higher-priced FEMA unit sales in the prior-year period, changes to core product mix, and a decrease in material surcharges. The number of Canadian factory-built homes sold in the quarter decreased to 232 homes compared to 303 homes in the prior-year period due to the higher interest rate environment and softening demand. Gross profit decreased by 57.5% to $116.5 million in the second quarter fiscal 2024 compared to the prior-year period. Gross profit margin was 25.1% of net sales, a contraction of 890 basis points compared to 34.0% in the second quarter fiscal 2023. The change in gross profit margin was driven by lower ASPs due to the higher-priced FEMA unit sales in the prior-year period and a shift in product mix to homes with fewer options. Gross margins were also impacted by softer demand and recently opened plants. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the second quarter fiscal 2024 decreased to $64.5 million from $83.9 million in the same period last year. SG&A during the quarter decreased due to less variable compensation expense from lower sales volumes. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 13.9%, compared to 10.4% in the prior year period. Net income decreased by 68.3% to $45.7 million for the second quarter fiscal 2024 compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in net income was driven by lower sales and gross profit in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter fiscal 2024 decreased by 70.2% to $58.8 million compared to the second quarter fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 12.7%, compared to 24.4% in the prior-year period. As of September 30, 2023, Skyline Champion had $701.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $96.6 million in the current quarter, due to the strategic investment in ECN Capital partially offset by cash flows from operations.

About Skyline Champion Corporation: Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE: SKY) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in North America and employs approximately 8,600 people subsequent to the closing of the acquisition of Regional Homes in October 2023. With more than 70 years of homebuilding experience and 47 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States and western Canada, Skyline Champion is well positioned with an innovative portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, ADUs, park-models and modular buildings for the single-family, multi-family, and hospitality sectors. In addition to its core home building business, Skyline Champion provides construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes, operates a factory-direct retail business with 74 retail locations across the United States, and operates Star Fleet Trucking, providing transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States. Skyline Champion builds homes under some of the most well-known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Regional Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) throughout this press release, Skyline Champion has provided non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, which present operating results on a basis adjusted for certain items. Skyline Champion uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. Skyline Champion believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess its operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that Skyline Champion believes are not representative of its core business. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace, and should not be considered superior to, the presentation of Skyline Champion’s financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Skyline Champion defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus expenses or minus income, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest income or expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, (f) other non-operating income and costs, including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP. Skyline Champion believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, Skyline Champion’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled from the respective measure under U.S. GAAP in the tables below. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales reported in the statement of operations. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is calculated as net income or loss plus (a) equity-based compensation awards granted before December 31, 2018, (b) restructuring charges, (c) impairment of assets, and (d) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration of businesses, including the related tax effect, if any, on these items.

International sales accounted for 60 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We concluded a groundbreaking fiscal 2019 with our highest Q4 revenue ever, fueled by accelerating growth from Services, Wearables and iPad,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “With customers and reviewers raving about the new generation of iPhones, today’s debut of new, noise-cancelling AirPods Pro, the hotly-anticipated arrival of Apple TV+ just two days away, and our best lineup of products and services ever, we’re very optimistic about what the holiday quarter has in store.” “Our strong business performance drove record Q4 EPS of $3.03 and record Q4 operating cash flow of $19.9 billion,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We also returned over $21 billion to shareholders, including almost $18 billion in share repurchases and $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents, as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time.” Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2020 first quarter: • revenue between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion • gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent • operating expenses between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion • other income/(expense) of $200 million • tax rate of approximately 16.5 percent Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of the Company’s common stock.

The balance of calendar 2019 will be an exciting period, with major launches on all of our platforms, new services and several new products.” “Our year-over-year business performance improved compared to the March quarter and drove strong operating cash flow of $11.6 billion,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open market repurchases of almost 88 million Apple shares, and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.” Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter: • revenue between $61 billion and $64 billion • gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent • operating expenses between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion • other income/(expense) of $200 million • tax rate of approximately 16.5 percent Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of the Company’s common stock.

The balance of calendar 2019 will be an exciting period, with major launches on all of our platforms, new services and several new products.” “Our year-over-year business performance improved compared to the March quarter and drove strong operating cash flow of $11.6 billion,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open market repurchases of almost 88 million Apple shares, and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.” Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter: • revenue between $61 billion and $64 billion • gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent • operating expenses between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion • other income/(expense) of $200 million • tax rate of approximately 16.5 percent Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of the Company’s common stock.
