Third-Quarter Reported Results In Q3 2023, worldwide revenue was $9.50 billion, an increase of 37% compared with Q3 2022, driven by increases of 31% in volume, 6% due to higher realized prices, and 1% from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The volume increase was primarily driven by $1.42 billion from the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio (Zyprexa ® ), and volume growth from Verzenio ® , Mounjaro ® , Jardiance, Taltz ® and Trulicity ® , partially offset by the absence of COVID-19 antibodies revenue in 2023. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and the $386.6 million of COVID-19 antibodies sales in 2022, revenue in Q3 2023 increased 24%. New Products contributed $1.44 billion to revenue in Q3 2023. Growth Products revenue increased 12% to $4.96 billion in Q3 2023. Higher realized prices were primarily driven by Mounjaro savings card dynamics, partially offset by Trulicity. Revenue in the U.S. increased 21% to $5.37 billion, driven by a 13% increase in realized prices and a 9% increase in volume. The higher realized prices in the U.S. were driven by Mounjaro savings card dynamics, partially offset by lower realized prices for Trulicity. When excluding Mounjaro, U.S. price declined high-single digits for the quarter. The increase in U.S. volume was driven by Mounjaro, 3 Verzenio, Trulicity, Jardiance and Taltz, partially offset by the absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies in 2023. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue increased 32%. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 64% to $4.13 billion, driven by a 69% increase in volume and a 2% increase from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 7% decrease due to lower realized prices. The increase in volume outside the U.S. was largely driven by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, as well as increased volume for Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. The lower realized prices were primarily driven by a new supply arrangement associated with the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, revenue outside the U.S. increased 10%. Gross margin increased 42% to $7.64 billion in Q3 2023. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 80.4%, an increase of 3.1 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and the absence of COVID-19 antibodies sales in Q3 2023, as well as higher realized prices, partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion. In Q3 2023, research and development expenses increased 34% to $2.41 billion, or 25% of revenue, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12% to $1.80 billion in Q3 2023, primarily driven by costs associated with launches of new products and indications, as well as compensation and benefits costs. 4 In Q3 2023, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $2.98 billion, compared with $62.4 million in Q3 2022. The Q3 2023 charges primarily related to the acquisitions of DICE Therapeutics, Inc., Versanis Bio, Inc. and Emergence Therapeutics AG. There were no asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges recognized in Q3 2023. In Q3 2022, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $206.5 million. Other income (expense) was $23.2 million of expense in Q3 2023 compared with $111.0 million of expense in Q3 2022. The decrease in expense was primarily driven by lower net losses on investments in equity securities in Q3 2023 compared with Q3 2022. The effective tax rate was 113.4% in Q3 2023 compared with 7.3% in Q3 2022. The higher effective tax rate for Q3 2023 was primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. In Q3 2023, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share were $(57.4) million and $(0.06), respectively, compared with net income of $1.45 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.61 in Q3 2022. EPS in Q3 2023 was inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, as well as a decrease of $3.29 from acquired IPR&D charges, compared with a decrease of $0.06 from acquired IPR&D charges in Q3 2022 . Third-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 2023 gross margin increased 41% to $7.76 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 81.7%, an increase of 2.7 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and the absence of COVID-19 antibodies sales in Q3 2023, as well as higher realized prices, partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion. 5 The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 84.6% in Q3 2023 compared with 10.7% in Q3 2022. The higher effective tax rate for Q3 2023 reflected the non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 2023 net income and EPS were $94.8 million and $0.10, respectively, compared with $1.79 billion and $1.98 in Q3 2022. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 2023 was inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, as well as a decrease of $3.29 from acquired IPR&D charges, compared with a decrease of $0.06 from acquired IPR&D charges in Q3 2022 .

U.S. revenue decreased 11% to $1.26 billion, primarily driven by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in both periods, as well as unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns and increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 4% to $414.6 million, driven by lower realized prices and decreased volume, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Volumes in international markets were affected by actions Lilly has taken to manage strong demand amid tight supply, including measures to minimize impact to existing patients. Mounjaro For Q3 2023, worldwide Mounjaro revenue was $1.41 billion. U.S. revenue was $1.28 billion reflecting higher realized prices due to decreased utilization of savings card programs as access continues to expand and increased demand. In Q3 2023, Lilly experienced intermittent delays fulfilling orders of certain Mounjaro doses given significant demand, which affected volume. Revenue outside the U.S. was $132.4 million. Verzenio For Q3 2023, worldwide Verzenio revenue increased 68% compared with Q3 2022 to $1.04 billion. U.S. revenue was $684.6 million, an increase of 65%, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. was $355.7 million, an increase of 75%, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Taltz For Q3 2023, worldwide Taltz revenue increased 9% compared with Q3 2022 to $744.2 million. U.S. revenue increased 3% to $509.3 million, driven by increased demand, largely offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 26% to $234.9 million, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. 8 Jardiance For Q3 2023, worldwide Jardiance revenue increased 22% compared with Q3 2022 to $700.8 million. U.S. revenue was $415.9 million, an increase of 19%, primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $284.8 million, an increase of 28%, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Jardiance is part of the company's alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. Lilly reports as revenue royalties received on net sales of Jardiance. Humalog For Q3 2023, worldwide Humalog revenue decreased 12% compared with Q3 2022 to $395.4 million. U.S. revenue was $194.2 million, a decrease of 22%, driven by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. was $201.2 million, an increase of 1%. Olumiant For Q3 2023, worldwide Olumiant revenue increased 27% compared with Q3 2022 to $231.4 million. U.S. revenue increased to $65.7 million, driven by increased demand due to utilization for the treatment of alopecia areata, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. was $165.7 million, an increase of 4%, driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices. Emgality For Q3 2023, worldwide Emgality revenue remained flat compared with Q3 2022 at $168.5 million. U.S. revenue increased 11% to $126.5 million, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 23% to $42.1 million, driven by decreased volume resulting from customer buying patterns in Japan and lower realized prices. 9 2023 Financial Guidance The company updated certain elements of its 2023 financial guidance on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. Revenue guidance remains unchanged with the range of $33.4 to $33.9 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue remains unchanged at approximately 78% on a reported basis and 80% on a non-GAAP basis, but is trending toward the higher end of this estimate. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses guidance remains unchanged with the range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, and research and development expenses guidance also remains unchanged with the range of $8.9 to $9.1 billion. Both expense categories are trending toward the top ends of these ranges. Acquired IPR&D guidance increased by $2.98 billion to $3.18 billion, reflecting charges incurred through Q3 2023. Charges in Q3 2023 primarily related to the acquisitions of DICE Therapeutics, Inc., Versanis Bio, Inc. and Emergence Therapeutics AG. Other income (expense) guidance has been updated to the range of $150 to $50 million of expense on a reported basis and remains unchanged on a non-GAAP basis with the range of $0 to $100 million of income. The update to the reported guidance reflects net losses on investments in equity securities incurred through Q3 2023. The estimated effective tax rate increased to 19% to 20%, primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges incurred in Q3 2023. 10 Based on these changes, EPS guidance decreased to the range of $5.95 to $6.15 on a reported basis and $6.50 to $6.70 on a non-GAAP basis. The company's 2023 financial guidance reflects adjustments shown in the reconciliation table below. 2023 Expectations Earnings per share (reported) $5.95 to $6.15 Amortization of intangible assets .44 Net losses on investments in equity securities .12 Earnings per share (non-GAAP) $6.50 to $6.70 Numbers may not add due to rounding 11 The following table summarizes the company's updated 2023 financial guidance: 2023 Guidance (1) Prior Updated Revenue $33.4 to $33.9 billion Unchanged Gross Margin % of Revenue (reported) Approx. 78% Unchanged Gross Margin % of Revenue (non-GAAP) Approx. 80% Unchanged Marketing, Selling & Administrative $7.2 to $7.4 billion Unchanged Research & Development $8.9 to $9.1 billion Unchanged Acquired IPR&D $202 million $3.18 billion (2) Other Income/(Expense) (reported) $(75) to $25 million $(150) to $(50) million Other Income/(Expense) (non-GAAP) $0 to $100 million Unchanged Tax Rate 14% to 15% 19% to 20% Earnings per Share (reported) $9.20 to $9.40 $5.95 to $6.15 Earnings per Share (non-GAAP) $9.70 to $9.90 $6.50 to $6.70 (1) Non-GAAP guidance reflects adjustments presented in the earnings per share reconciliation table above.

Third-Quarter Reported Results In Q3 2023, worldwide revenue was $9.50 billion, an increase of 37% compared with Q3 2022, driven by increases of 31% in volume, 6% due to higher realized prices, and 1% from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The volume increase was primarily driven by $1.42 billion from the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio (Zyprexa ® ), and volume growth from Verzenio ® , Mounjaro ® , Jardiance, Taltz ® and Trulicity ® , partially offset by the absence of COVID-19 antibodies revenue in 2023. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and the $386.6 million of COVID-19 antibodies sales in 2022, revenue in Q3 2023 increased 24%. New Products contributed $1.44 billion to revenue in Q3 2023. Growth Products revenue increased 12% to $4.96 billion in Q3 2023. Higher realized prices were primarily driven by Mounjaro savings card dynamics, partially offset by Trulicity. Revenue in the U.S. increased 21% to $5.37 billion, driven by a 13% increase in realized prices and a 9% increase in volume. The higher realized prices in the U.S. were driven by Mounjaro savings card dynamics, partially offset by lower realized prices for Trulicity. When excluding Mounjaro, U.S. price declined high-single digits for the quarter. The increase in U.S. volume was driven by Mounjaro, 3 Verzenio, Trulicity, Jardiance and Taltz, partially offset by the absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies in 2023. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue increased 32%. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 64% to $4.13 billion, driven by a 69% increase in volume and a 2% increase from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a 7% decrease due to lower realized prices. The increase in volume outside the U.S. was largely driven by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, as well as increased volume for Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. The lower realized prices were primarily driven by a new supply arrangement associated with the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, revenue outside the U.S. increased 10%. Gross margin increased 42% to $7.64 billion in Q3 2023. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 80.4%, an increase of 3.1 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and the absence of COVID-19 antibodies sales in Q3 2023, as well as higher realized prices, partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion. In Q3 2023, research and development expenses increased 34% to $2.41 billion, or 25% of revenue, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12% to $1.80 billion in Q3 2023, primarily driven by costs associated with launches of new products and indications, as well as compensation and benefits costs. 4 In Q3 2023, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $2.98 billion, compared with $62.4 million in Q3 2022. The Q3 2023 charges primarily related to the acquisitions of DICE Therapeutics, Inc., Versanis Bio, Inc. and Emergence Therapeutics AG. There were no asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges recognized in Q3 2023. In Q3 2022, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $206.5 million. Other income (expense) was $23.2 million of expense in Q3 2023 compared with $111.0 million of expense in Q3 2022. The decrease in expense was primarily driven by lower net losses on investments in equity securities in Q3 2023 compared with Q3 2022. The effective tax rate was 113.4% in Q3 2023 compared with 7.3% in Q3 2022. The higher effective tax rate for Q3 2023 was primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. In Q3 2023, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share were $(57.4) million and $(0.06), respectively, compared with net income of $1.45 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.61 in Q3 2022. EPS in Q3 2023 was inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, as well as a decrease of $3.29 from acquired IPR&D charges, compared with a decrease of $0.06 from acquired IPR&D charges in Q3 2022 . Third-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 2023 gross margin increased 41% to $7.76 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 81.7%, an increase of 2.7 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and the absence of COVID-19 antibodies sales in Q3 2023, as well as higher realized prices, partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion. 5 The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 84.6% in Q3 2023 compared with 10.7% in Q3 2022. The higher effective tax rate for Q3 2023 reflected the non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 2023 net income and EPS were $94.8 million and $0.10, respectively, compared with $1.79 billion and $1.98 in Q3 2022. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 2023 was inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, as well as a decrease of $3.29 from acquired IPR&D charges, compared with a decrease of $0.06 from acquired IPR&D charges in Q3 2022 .

U.S. revenue decreased 11% to $1.26 billion, primarily driven by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in both periods, as well as unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns and increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 4% to $414.6 million, driven by lower realized prices and decreased volume, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Volumes in international markets were affected by actions Lilly has taken to manage strong demand amid tight supply, including measures to minimize impact to existing patients. Mounjaro For Q3 2023, worldwide Mounjaro revenue was $1.41 billion. U.S. revenue was $1.28 billion reflecting higher realized prices due to decreased utilization of savings card programs as access continues to expand and increased demand. In Q3 2023, Lilly experienced intermittent delays fulfilling orders of certain Mounjaro doses given significant demand, which affected volume. Revenue outside the U.S. was $132.4 million. Verzenio For Q3 2023, worldwide Verzenio revenue increased 68% compared with Q3 2022 to $1.04 billion. U.S. revenue was $684.6 million, an increase of 65%, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. was $355.7 million, an increase of 75%, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Taltz For Q3 2023, worldwide Taltz revenue increased 9% compared with Q3 2022 to $744.2 million. U.S. revenue increased 3% to $509.3 million, driven by increased demand, largely offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 26% to $234.9 million, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower realized prices. 8 Jardiance For Q3 2023, worldwide Jardiance revenue increased 22% compared with Q3 2022 to $700.8 million. U.S. revenue was $415.9 million, an increase of 19%, primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $284.8 million, an increase of 28%, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Jardiance is part of the company's alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. Lilly reports as revenue royalties received on net sales of Jardiance. Humalog For Q3 2023, worldwide Humalog revenue decreased 12% compared with Q3 2022 to $395.4 million. U.S. revenue was $194.2 million, a decrease of 22%, driven by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. was $201.2 million, an increase of 1%. Olumiant For Q3 2023, worldwide Olumiant revenue increased 27% compared with Q3 2022 to $231.4 million. U.S. revenue increased to $65.7 million, driven by increased demand due to utilization for the treatment of alopecia areata, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. was $165.7 million, an increase of 4%, driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices. Emgality For Q3 2023, worldwide Emgality revenue remained flat compared with Q3 2022 at $168.5 million. U.S. revenue increased 11% to $126.5 million, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 23% to $42.1 million, driven by decreased volume resulting from customer buying patterns in Japan and lower realized prices. 9 2023 Financial Guidance The company updated certain elements of its 2023 financial guidance on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. Revenue guidance remains unchanged with the range of $33.4 to $33.9 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue remains unchanged at approximately 78% on a reported basis and 80% on a non-GAAP basis, but is trending toward the higher end of this estimate. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses guidance remains unchanged with the range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, and research and development expenses guidance also remains unchanged with the range of $8.9 to $9.1 billion. Both expense categories are trending toward the top ends of these ranges. Acquired IPR&D guidance increased by $2.98 billion to $3.18 billion, reflecting charges incurred through Q3 2023. Charges in Q3 2023 primarily related to the acquisitions of DICE Therapeutics, Inc., Versanis Bio, Inc. and Emergence Therapeutics AG. Other income (expense) guidance has been updated to the range of $150 to $50 million of expense on a reported basis and remains unchanged on a non-GAAP basis with the range of $0 to $100 million of income. The update to the reported guidance reflects net losses on investments in equity securities incurred through Q3 2023. The estimated effective tax rate increased to 19% to 20%, primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges incurred in Q3 2023. 10 Based on these changes, EPS guidance decreased to the range of $5.95 to $6.15 on a reported basis and $6.50 to $6.70 on a non-GAAP basis. The company's 2023 financial guidance reflects adjustments shown in the reconciliation table below. 2023 Expectations Earnings per share (reported) $5.95 to $6.15 Amortization of intangible assets .44 Net losses on investments in equity securities .12 Earnings per share (non-GAAP) $6.50 to $6.70 Numbers may not add due to rounding 11 The following table summarizes the company's updated 2023 financial guidance: 2023 Guidance (1) Prior Updated Revenue $33.4 to $33.9 billion Unchanged Gross Margin % of Revenue (reported) Approx. 78% Unchanged Gross Margin % of Revenue (non-GAAP) Approx. 80% Unchanged Marketing, Selling & Administrative $7.2 to $7.4 billion Unchanged Research & Development $8.9 to $9.1 billion Unchanged Acquired IPR&D $202 million $3.18 billion (2) Other Income/(Expense) (reported) $(75) to $25 million $(150) to $(50) million Other Income/(Expense) (non-GAAP) $0 to $100 million Unchanged Tax Rate 14% to 15% 19% to 20% Earnings per Share (reported) $9.20 to $9.40 $5.95 to $6.15 Earnings per Share (non-GAAP) $9.70 to $9.90 $6.50 to $6.70 (1) Non-GAAP guidance reflects adjustments presented in the earnings per share reconciliation table above.

Second-Quarter Reported Results In Q2 2023, worldwide revenue was $8.31 billion, an increase of 28% compared with Q2 2022, driven by a 29% increase in volume, slightly offset by a 1% decrease from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Realized prices remained relatively flat compared with Q2 2022. The volume increase was driven by growth from Mounjaro ® , Verzenio ® , Jardiance, and Taltz ® , as well as $579.0 million from the sale of rights for Baqsimi ® , partially offset by lower volume from Alimta ® due to the loss of patent exclusivity. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi, and $129.1 million from the sales of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, revenue in Q2 2023 increased 22% and worldwide volume increased 23%. New Products contributed $1.00 billion to revenue in Q2 2023. Growth Products revenue increased 16% to $4.93 billion in Q2 2023. Revenue in the U.S. increased 41% to $5.53 billion, driven by a 39% increase in volume and a 2% increase due to higher realized prices. The increase in U.S. volume was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Trulicity ® and Taltz, as well as the sale of rights for Baqsimi, partially offset by decreased volume from Alimta and the complete reduction of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies. The higher realized prices in the U.S. were primarily driven by Mounjaro, partially offset by lower 3 realized prices for Trulicity. When excluding Mounjaro, price declined low-single digits for the quarter. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 9% to $2.78 billion, driven by a 14% increase in volume, partially offset by a 3% decrease from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 3% decrease due to lower realized prices. The increase in volume outside the U.S. was largely driven by Verzenio, Jardiance and Mounjaro. The lower realized prices were primarily driven by Verzenio, Olumiant ® and Trulicity. Gross margin increased 29% to $6.50 billion in Q2 2023. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78.3%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by product mix, including the sale of rights for Baqsimi, and the amortization of intangible assets, largely offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion. In Q2 2023, research and development expenses increased 32% to $2.36 billion, or 28% of revenue, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 18% to $1.93 billion in Q2 2023, primarily driven by costs associated with launches of new products and indications. In Q2 2023, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $97.1 million. In Q2 2022, the company recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $440.4 million. Other income (expense) was expense of $36.8 million in Q2 2023 compared with expense of $119.2 million in Q2 2022. The decrease in expense was primarily driven by lower net losses on investments in equity securities in Q2 2023 compared with Q2 2022. 4 The effective tax rate was 15.6% in Q2 2023 compared with 12.7% in Q2 2022. The effective tax rate in Q2 2023 reflected the tax impacts of the new Puerto Rico tax regime and the sale of rights for Baqsimi. The effective tax rate in Q2 2022 was impacted by non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. In Q2 2023, net income and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.76 billion and $1.95, respectively, compared with $952.5 million and $1.05 in Q2 2022. EPS in Q2 2023 is inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sale of rights for Baqsimi and $0.09 of acquired IPR&D charges compared with $0.46 of acquired IPR&D charges in Q2 2022 . Second-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 2023 gross margin increased 28% to $6.63 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue remained relatively flat compared with Q2 2022 at 79.8% as the favorable impact from product mix, including the sale of rights for Baqsimi, was offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 16.1% in Q2 2023 compared with 14.2% in Q2 2022. The effective tax rate for Q2 2023 reflected the tax impacts of the new Puerto Rico tax regime and the sale of rights for Baqsimi. The effective tax rate in Q2 2022 was impacted by non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 2023 net income and EPS were $1.90 billion and $2.11, respectively, compared with $1.13 billion and $1.25 in Q2 2022. Non-GAAP EPS in Q2 2023 was inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sale of rights for Baqsimi and $0.09 of acquired IPR&D charges compared with $0.46 of acquired IPR&D charges in Q2 2022 . 5 For further detail on non-GAAP measures, see the reconciliation below as well as the ""Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Selected Non-GAAP Adjusted Information (Unaudited)"" table later in this press release.

U.S. revenue decreased 4% to $1.37 billion, driven by lower realized prices due to unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates, partially offset by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 8% to $441.2 million, driven by decreased volume, lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Volumes in international markets were affected by actions Lilly has taken to manage strong demand amid tight supply, including measures to minimize existing patient impact. Verzenio For Q2 2023, worldwide Verzenio revenue increased 57% compared with Q2 2022 to $926.8 million. U.S. revenue was $588.6 million, an increase of 53%, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. was $338.2 million, an increase of 66%, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Mounjaro For Q2 2023, worldwide Mounjaro revenue was $979.7 million. U.S. revenue was $915.7 million reflecting increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices due to decreased utilization of savings card programs as access continues to expand. Lilly has experienced and continues to expect intermittent delays fulfilling orders of certain Mounjaro doses given significant demand. These delays have impacted, and may continue to impact, volume. Mounjaro launched in the U.S. for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in June 2022. Revenue outside the U.S. was $64.0 million. Jardiance For Q2 2023, worldwide Jardiance revenue increased 45% compared with Q2 2022 to $668.3 million. U.S. revenue was $386.1 million, an increase of 54%, primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $282.2 million, an increase of 34%, driven by increased volume. 8 Jardiance is part of the company's alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. Lilly reports as revenue royalties received on net sales of Jardiance. Taltz For Q2 2023, worldwide Taltz revenue increased 16% compared with Q2 2022 to $703.9 million. U.S. revenue increased 15% to $472.3 million, primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 19% to $231.6 million, driven by increased volume. Humalog For Q2 2023, worldwide Humalog revenue decreased 1% compared with Q2 2022 to $440.4 million. U.S. revenue was $229.8 million, a decrease of 4%, primarily driven by lower realized prices, partially offset by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $210.6 million, an increase of 1%. Olumiant For Q2 2023, worldwide Olumiant revenue increased 18% compared with Q2 2022 to $218.9 million. U.S. revenue increased to $50.8 million, driven by increased demand due to utilization for the treatment of alopecia areata. Revenue outside the U.S. was $168.1 million, a decrease of 4%, driven by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume. Emgality For Q2 2023, worldwide Emgality revenue increased 8% compared with Q2 2022 to $169.3 million. U.S. revenue increased 9% to $118.8 million, primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 3% to $50.5 million, primarily driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 9 2023 Financial Guidance The company updated its 2023 financial guidance on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. Revenue guidance increased by $2.2 billion to the range of $33.4 to $33.9 billion. Approximately $1.5 billion of this increase is driven by business development activity, including the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, which closed in July 2023, and Baqsimi, with the remainder reflecting strong underlying business performance. Gross margin as a percent of revenue guidance increased 1% on both a reported and non-GAAP basis to approximately 78% and 80%, respectively, driven by the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi. The company's guidance for marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased by $200 million to the range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, driven by additional investments in recent launches and preparations for key launches expected in the second half of 2023. Research and development expenses guidance increased by $600 million to the range of $8.9 to $9.1 billion. Research and development expenses are expected to be impacted by additional investments in the company's late-stage portfolio and in early-stage research, and incremental expense from previously announced business development activities. Acquired IPR&D guidance increased by $97 million to $202 million, reflecting charges through Q2 2023. Other income (expense) guidance was updated to the range of $75 million of expense to $25 million of income on a reported basis, and $0 to $100 million of income on a non-GAAP basis. The reported and non-GAAP guidance updates both reflect increases driven by the interest impact of higher cash balances, and the reported guidance also incorporates net losses on investments in equity securities through Q2 2023. 10 The estimated effective tax rate increased to 14% to 15%, reflecting the impacts of the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi. Based on these changes, EPS guidance increased to the range of $9.20 to $9.40 on a reported basis and $9.70 to $9.90 on a non-GAAP basis. The company's 2023 financial guidance reflects adjustments shown in the reconciliation table below. 2023 Expectations Earnings per share (reported) $9.20 to $9.40 Amortization of intangible assets .44 Net losses on investments in equity securities .07 Earnings per share (non-GAAP) $9.70 to $9.90 Numbers may not add due to rounding 11 The following table summarizes the company's updated 2023 financial guidance: 2023 Guidance (1) Prior Updated Revenue $31.2 to $31.7 billion $33.4 to $33.9 billion Gross Margin % of Revenue (reported) Approx. 77% Approx. 78% Gross Margin % of Revenue (non-GAAP) Approx. 79% Approx. 80% Marketing, Selling & Administrative $7.0 to $7.2 billion $7.2 to $7.4 billion Research & Development $8.3 to $8.5 billion $8.9 to $9.1 billion Acquired IPR&D $105 million $202 million (2) Other Income/(Expense) (reported) $(200) to $(100) million $(75) to $25 million Other Income/(Expense) (non-GAAP) $(200) to $(100) million $0 to $100 million Tax Rate Approx. 13% 14% to 15% Earnings per Share (reported) $8.18 to $8.38 $9.20 to $9.40 Earnings per Share (non-GAAP) $8.65 to $8.85 $9.70 to $9.90 (1) Non-GAAP guidance reflects adjustments presented in the earnings per share reconciliation table above.

Second-Quarter Reported Results In Q2 2023, worldwide revenue was $8.31 billion, an increase of 28% compared with Q2 2022, driven by a 29% increase in volume, slightly offset by a 1% decrease from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Realized prices remained relatively flat compared with Q2 2022. The volume increase was driven by growth from Mounjaro ® , Verzenio ® , Jardiance, and Taltz ® , as well as $579.0 million from the sale of rights for Baqsimi ® , partially offset by lower volume from Alimta ® due to the loss of patent exclusivity. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi, and $129.1 million from the sales of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, revenue in Q2 2023 increased 22% and worldwide volume increased 23%. New Products contributed $1.00 billion to revenue in Q2 2023. Growth Products revenue increased 16% to $4.93 billion in Q2 2023. Revenue in the U.S. increased 41% to $5.53 billion, driven by a 39% increase in volume and a 2% increase due to higher realized prices. The increase in U.S. volume was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Trulicity ® and Taltz, as well as the sale of rights for Baqsimi, partially offset by decreased volume from Alimta and the complete reduction of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies. The higher realized prices in the U.S. were primarily driven by Mounjaro, partially offset by lower 3 realized prices for Trulicity. When excluding Mounjaro, price declined low-single digits for the quarter. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 9% to $2.78 billion, driven by a 14% increase in volume, partially offset by a 3% decrease from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 3% decrease due to lower realized prices. The increase in volume outside the U.S. was largely driven by Verzenio, Jardiance and Mounjaro. The lower realized prices were primarily driven by Verzenio, Olumiant ® and Trulicity. Gross margin increased 29% to $6.50 billion in Q2 2023. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78.3%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by product mix, including the sale of rights for Baqsimi, and the amortization of intangible assets, largely offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion. In Q2 2023, research and development expenses increased 32% to $2.36 billion, or 28% of revenue, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 18% to $1.93 billion in Q2 2023, primarily driven by costs associated with launches of new products and indications. In Q2 2023, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $97.1 million. In Q2 2022, the company recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $440.4 million. Other income (expense) was expense of $36.8 million in Q2 2023 compared with expense of $119.2 million in Q2 2022. The decrease in expense was primarily driven by lower net losses on investments in equity securities in Q2 2023 compared with Q2 2022. 4 The effective tax rate was 15.6% in Q2 2023 compared with 12.7% in Q2 2022. The effective tax rate in Q2 2023 reflected the tax impacts of the new Puerto Rico tax regime and the sale of rights for Baqsimi. The effective tax rate in Q2 2022 was impacted by non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. In Q2 2023, net income and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.76 billion and $1.95, respectively, compared with $952.5 million and $1.05 in Q2 2022. EPS in Q2 2023 is inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sale of rights for Baqsimi and $0.09 of acquired IPR&D charges compared with $0.46 of acquired IPR&D charges in Q2 2022 . Second-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 2023 gross margin increased 28% to $6.63 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue remained relatively flat compared with Q2 2022 at 79.8% as the favorable impact from product mix, including the sale of rights for Baqsimi, was offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and investments in capacity expansion. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 16.1% in Q2 2023 compared with 14.2% in Q2 2022. The effective tax rate for Q2 2023 reflected the tax impacts of the new Puerto Rico tax regime and the sale of rights for Baqsimi. The effective tax rate in Q2 2022 was impacted by non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 2023 net income and EPS were $1.90 billion and $2.11, respectively, compared with $1.13 billion and $1.25 in Q2 2022. Non-GAAP EPS in Q2 2023 was inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sale of rights for Baqsimi and $0.09 of acquired IPR&D charges compared with $0.46 of acquired IPR&D charges in Q2 2022 . 5 For further detail on non-GAAP measures, see the reconciliation below as well as the ""Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Selected Non-GAAP Adjusted Information (Unaudited)"" table later in this press release.

U.S. revenue decreased 4% to $1.37 billion, driven by lower realized prices due to unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates, partially offset by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. decreased 8% to $441.2 million, driven by decreased volume, lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Volumes in international markets were affected by actions Lilly has taken to manage strong demand amid tight supply, including measures to minimize existing patient impact. Verzenio For Q2 2023, worldwide Verzenio revenue increased 57% compared with Q2 2022 to $926.8 million. U.S. revenue was $588.6 million, an increase of 53%, driven by increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. was $338.2 million, an increase of 66%, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Mounjaro For Q2 2023, worldwide Mounjaro revenue was $979.7 million. U.S. revenue was $915.7 million reflecting increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices due to decreased utilization of savings card programs as access continues to expand. Lilly has experienced and continues to expect intermittent delays fulfilling orders of certain Mounjaro doses given significant demand. These delays have impacted, and may continue to impact, volume. Mounjaro launched in the U.S. for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in June 2022. Revenue outside the U.S. was $64.0 million. Jardiance For Q2 2023, worldwide Jardiance revenue increased 45% compared with Q2 2022 to $668.3 million. U.S. revenue was $386.1 million, an increase of 54%, primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $282.2 million, an increase of 34%, driven by increased volume. 8 Jardiance is part of the company's alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. Lilly reports as revenue royalties received on net sales of Jardiance. Taltz For Q2 2023, worldwide Taltz revenue increased 16% compared with Q2 2022 to $703.9 million. U.S. revenue increased 15% to $472.3 million, primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 19% to $231.6 million, driven by increased volume. Humalog For Q2 2023, worldwide Humalog revenue decreased 1% compared with Q2 2022 to $440.4 million. U.S. revenue was $229.8 million, a decrease of 4%, primarily driven by lower realized prices, partially offset by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $210.6 million, an increase of 1%. Olumiant For Q2 2023, worldwide Olumiant revenue increased 18% compared with Q2 2022 to $218.9 million. U.S. revenue increased to $50.8 million, driven by increased demand due to utilization for the treatment of alopecia areata. Revenue outside the U.S. was $168.1 million, a decrease of 4%, driven by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume. Emgality For Q2 2023, worldwide Emgality revenue increased 8% compared with Q2 2022 to $169.3 million. U.S. revenue increased 9% to $118.8 million, primarily driven by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 3% to $50.5 million, primarily driven by increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 9 2023 Financial Guidance The company updated its 2023 financial guidance on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. Revenue guidance increased by $2.2 billion to the range of $33.4 to $33.9 billion. Approximately $1.5 billion of this increase is driven by business development activity, including the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio, which closed in July 2023, and Baqsimi, with the remainder reflecting strong underlying business performance. Gross margin as a percent of revenue guidance increased 1% on both a reported and non-GAAP basis to approximately 78% and 80%, respectively, driven by the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi. The company's guidance for marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased by $200 million to the range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, driven by additional investments in recent launches and preparations for key launches expected in the second half of 2023. Research and development expenses guidance increased by $600 million to the range of $8.9 to $9.1 billion. Research and development expenses are expected to be impacted by additional investments in the company's late-stage portfolio and in early-stage research, and incremental expense from previously announced business development activities. Acquired IPR&D guidance increased by $97 million to $202 million, reflecting charges through Q2 2023. Other income (expense) guidance was updated to the range of $75 million of expense to $25 million of income on a reported basis, and $0 to $100 million of income on a non-GAAP basis. The reported and non-GAAP guidance updates both reflect increases driven by the interest impact of higher cash balances, and the reported guidance also incorporates net losses on investments in equity securities through Q2 2023. 10 The estimated effective tax rate increased to 14% to 15%, reflecting the impacts of the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi. Based on these changes, EPS guidance increased to the range of $9.20 to $9.40 on a reported basis and $9.70 to $9.90 on a non-GAAP basis. The company's 2023 financial guidance reflects adjustments shown in the reconciliation table below. 2023 Expectations Earnings per share (reported) $9.20 to $9.40 Amortization of intangible assets .44 Net losses on investments in equity securities .07 Earnings per share (non-GAAP) $9.70 to $9.90 Numbers may not add due to rounding 11 The following table summarizes the company's updated 2023 financial guidance: 2023 Guidance (1) Prior Updated Revenue $31.2 to $31.7 billion $33.4 to $33.9 billion Gross Margin % of Revenue (reported) Approx. 77% Approx. 78% Gross Margin % of Revenue (non-GAAP) Approx. 79% Approx. 80% Marketing, Selling & Administrative $7.0 to $7.2 billion $7.2 to $7.4 billion Research & Development $8.3 to $8.5 billion $8.9 to $9.1 billion Acquired IPR&D $105 million $202 million (2) Other Income/(Expense) (reported) $(200) to $(100) million $(75) to $25 million Other Income/(Expense) (non-GAAP) $(200) to $(100) million $0 to $100 million Tax Rate Approx. 13% 14% to 15% Earnings per Share (reported) $8.18 to $8.38 $9.20 to $9.40 Earnings per Share (non-GAAP) $8.65 to $8.85 $9.70 to $9.90 (1) Non-GAAP guidance reflects adjustments presented in the earnings per share reconciliation table above.

This includes an approximately 1 percentage point increase due to acquisitions. The growth was driven by the impact of the following factors: ◦ An increase in switched transactions of 20% . ◦ An increase in cross-border volumes of 17% on a local currency basis. ◦ A 14% increase in gross dollar volume, on a local currency basis, to $1.7 trillion . ◦ An increase in other revenues of 33% , or 34% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a 4 percentage point increase due to acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by the company’s Data & Services and Cyber & Intelligence solutions. ◦ These increases were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes. • Total operating expenses increased 12% , or 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the impact of Third -Quarter Special Items, adjusted operating expenses increased 15% , or 16% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a 3 percentage point increase due to acquisitions. The remaining 13 percentage points of growth was primarily related to the company’s continued investment in strategic initiatives. • Other income (expense) was unfavorable $98 million versus the year-ago period, primarily due to net unrealized losses recorded on equity investments in the current period. Excluding these losses, adjusted other income (expense) remained relatively flat. This includes other nonrecurring gains of approximately $16 million partially offset by higher interest expense. • The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 16.9% , versus 16.1% for the comparable period in 2018 . The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 16.8% , versus 19.1% for the comparable period in 2018 , primarily attributable to a discrete tax benefit related to a favorable court ruling in 2019 and a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in the current period. • As of September 30, 2019 , the company’s customers had issued 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards. Return of Capital to Shareholders During the third quarter of 2019 , Mastercard repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares at a cost of $1.8 billion and paid $335 million in dividends. Quarter-to-date through October 24, the company repurchased an additional 1.6 million shares at a cost of $449 million , which leaves $0.8 billion remaining under current repurchase program authorizations.

Non-GAAP Financial Information Mastercard discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted other income (expense), adjusted effective income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (as well as related applicable growth rates versus the comparable period in the prior year). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on the company’s equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts. The company excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. In addition, the company presents growth rates, including net revenue, adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results. The impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from the company’s U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. The company believes the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to understanding its operating results. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The company’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. The company includes reconciliations of the requisite non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be Mastercard Incorporated - Page 5 considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Effective Q1 2018, our operational metrics reflect the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation. Mastercard Incorporated - Page 11 Footnote The tables set forth the gross dollar volume (“GDV”), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions and cards on a regional and global basis for Mastercard™-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. Debit transactions on Maestro® and Cirrus®-branded cards and transactions involving brands other than Mastercard are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are Mastercard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. The Mastercard payment product is comprised of credit, charge, debit and prepaid programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving Mastercard-branded cards that are not switched by Mastercard and transactions for which Mastercard does not earn significant revenues. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems. The data set forth in the cards columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by Mastercard. A portion of the data set forth in the cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers. Performance information for prior periods can be found in the “Investor Relations” section of the Mastercard website at www.mastercard.com/investor.

This includes an approximately 1 percentage point increase due to acquisitions. The growth was driven by the impact of the following factors: ◦ An increase in switched transactions of 20% . ◦ An increase in cross-border volumes of 17% on a local currency basis. ◦ A 14% increase in gross dollar volume, on a local currency basis, to $1.7 trillion . ◦ An increase in other revenues of 33% , or 34% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a 4 percentage point increase due to acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by the company’s Data & Services and Cyber & Intelligence solutions. ◦ These increases were partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes. • Total operating expenses increased 12% , or 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Excluding the impact of Third -Quarter Special Items, adjusted operating expenses increased 15% , or 16% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a 3 percentage point increase due to acquisitions. The remaining 13 percentage points of growth was primarily related to the company’s continued investment in strategic initiatives. • Other income (expense) was unfavorable $98 million versus the year-ago period, primarily due to net unrealized losses recorded on equity investments in the current period. Excluding these losses, adjusted other income (expense) remained relatively flat. This includes other nonrecurring gains of approximately $16 million partially offset by higher interest expense. • The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 16.9% , versus 16.1% for the comparable period in 2018 . The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 16.8% , versus 19.1% for the comparable period in 2018 , primarily attributable to a discrete tax benefit related to a favorable court ruling in 2019 and a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in the current period. • As of September 30, 2019 , the company’s customers had issued 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards. Return of Capital to Shareholders During the third quarter of 2019 , Mastercard repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares at a cost of $1.8 billion and paid $335 million in dividends.

Non-GAAP Financial Information Mastercard discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted other income (expense), adjusted effective income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (as well as related applicable growth rates versus the comparable period in the prior year). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on the company’s equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts. The company excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. In addition, the company presents growth rates, including net revenue, adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results. The impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from the company’s U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. The company believes the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to understanding its operating results. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The company’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. The company includes reconciliations of the requisite non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be Mastercard Incorporated - Page 5 considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Effective Q1 2018, our operational metrics reflect the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation. Mastercard Incorporated - Page 11 Footnote The tables set forth the gross dollar volume (“GDV”), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions and cards on a regional and global basis for Mastercard™-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. Debit transactions on Maestro® and Cirrus®-branded cards and transactions involving brands other than Mastercard are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are Mastercard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. The Mastercard payment product is comprised of credit, charge, debit and prepaid programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving Mastercard-branded cards that are not switched by Mastercard and transactions for which Mastercard does not earn significant revenues. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems. The data set forth in the cards columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by Mastercard. A portion of the data set forth in the cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers. Performance information for prior periods can be found in the “Investor Relations” section of the Mastercard website at www.mastercard.com/investor.

Excluding the impact of Special Items in the second quarter of 2018, adjusted operating expenses increased 14% , or 17% on a currency-neutral basis.

The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 18.5% , versus 18.8% for the comparable period in 2018 , primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings. • As of June 30, 2019 , the company’s customers had issued 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards.

Non-GAAP Financial Information Mastercard discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted other income (expense), adjusted effective income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (as well as related applicable growth rates versus the comparable period in the prior year). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on the company’s equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts. The company excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. In addition, the company presents growth rates, including net revenue, adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results. The impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from the company’s U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. The company believes the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to understanding its operating results. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The company’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. The company includes reconciliations of the requisite non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be Mastercard Incorporated - Page 5 considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Effective Q1 2018, our operational metrics reflect the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation. Mastercard Incorporated - Page 11 Footnote The tables set forth the gross dollar volume (“GDV”), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions and cards on a regional and global basis for Mastercard™-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. Debit transactions on Maestro® and Cirrus®-branded cards and transactions involving brands other than Mastercard are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are Mastercard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. The Mastercard payment product is comprised of credit, charge, debit and prepaid programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving Mastercard-branded cards that are not switched by Mastercard and transactions for which Mastercard does not earn significant revenues. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems. The data set forth in the cards columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by Mastercard. A portion of the data set forth in the cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers. Performance information for prior periods can be found in the “Investor Relations” section of the Mastercard website at www.mastercard.com/investor.

The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 18.5% , versus 18.8% for the comparable period in 2018 , primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings. • As of June 30, 2019 , the company’s customers had issued 2.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards.

Non-GAAP Financial Information Mastercard discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted other income (expense), adjusted effective income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (as well as related applicable growth rates versus the comparable period in the prior year). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on the company’s equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts. The company excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. In addition, the company presents growth rates, including net revenue, adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results. The impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from the company’s U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. The company believes the presentation of currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information to understanding its operating results. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The company’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. The company includes reconciliations of the requisite non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be Mastercard Incorporated - Page 5 considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Effective Q1 2018, our operational metrics reflect the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation. Mastercard Incorporated - Page 11 Footnote The tables set forth the gross dollar volume (“GDV”), purchase volume, cash volume and the number of purchase transactions, cash transactions and cards on a regional and global basis for Mastercard™-branded cards. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. Debit transactions on Maestro® and Cirrus®-branded cards and transactions involving brands other than Mastercard are not included in the preceding tables. For purposes of the table: GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are Mastercard-branded payment accounts that do not generally have physical cards associated with them. The Mastercard payment product is comprised of credit, charge, debit and prepaid programs, and data relating to each type of program is included in the tables. The tables include information with respect to transactions involving Mastercard-branded cards that are not switched by Mastercard and transactions for which Mastercard does not earn significant revenues. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Mastercard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. Mastercard reports period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. The data set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems. The data set forth in the cards columns is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to certain limited verification by Mastercard. A portion of the data set forth in the cards columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among customers and other practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data in certain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers. Performance information for prior periods can be found in the “Investor Relations” section of the Mastercard website at www.mastercard.com/investor.
