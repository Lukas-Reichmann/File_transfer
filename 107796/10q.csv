NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021 (“Effective Time”), we consummated the business combination (“Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company which applies innovative science to known molecules to develop life-saving medicines through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company's foundation product, NRX-101 (D-cycloserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). NRX-101 is covered by multiple U.S. and foreign patents, including a Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx Pharmaceuticals by Glytech, LLC. ​ Operations ​ As disclosed during the quarter, the Company’s drug development activities have expanded from its original focus on development of NRX-101, a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine (DCS) and lurasidone for the treatment of suicidal bipolar depression to encompass the development of NRX-101 for the treatment of Chronic Pain and Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (cUTI) and the development of intravenous ketamine (NRX-100) for the treatment of suicidal depression. These additional indications have been added as the Company has gained access to clinical trials data funded by governmental entities in France and potentially in the United States which has the potential to afford the Company potential safety and efficacy data on key indications at low cost to shareholders. ​ Development of NRX-101 for treatment-resistant suicidal bipolar depression ​ The Company is nearing completion of enrollment of the originally-targeted 70 participants in the Phase 2b/3 trial of NRX-101 in TRBD; enrollment will continue through November to increase study power. The target population is based on the Company’s January 2023 meeting with the FDA in which the Company was guided to expand its intended use of NRX-101 from the original population of patients with acute suicidality who might be treated in the hospital environment to the broader population of patients with subacute suicidal ideation (now described by the Company as Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression) who are treated in the outpatient setting. ​ Based on the guidance of the FDA and the Company’s completion of manufacturing for phase 3/commercial stage investigational product, the Company upgraded the ongoing clinical trial to a phase 2b/3 trial, the results of which have the potential to be used for registrational filings. ​ During the first half of 2023, the Company refined its ability to validate the psychometric ratings that are used to assess the efficacy endpoints for the clinical trial. The Company relies upon a team of veteran raters who both train independent site raters and monitor the technical quality of each rating. A standard was set of 90 % or better congruence between the 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company’s veteran rating team and site raters. This standard was met for all study participants whose ratings were obtained in their primary language and management believes that this standard can be maintained for the duration of the trial. In Q2 2023, the Company released research findings that demonstrate better than 94 % congruence on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which constitutes the primary efficacy endpoint. As of the filing of this 10-Q, this data integrity standard has been maintained. ​ In April 2023, the Company contracted with 1nHealth to initiate a recruitment campaign that may cover up to 45 states in the U.S. to recruit sufficient participants for this enlarged trial. The Company has similarly broadened its relationship with Science 37, a contract research organization that conducts decentralized clinical trials, to enroll participants identified by the 1nHealth recruitment initiative and randomize them to be treated within the broadened clinical trial. 1nHealth has additionally engaged “The Mighty,” a voice-of-the-patient organization with national reach to publicize the clinical trial to the 800,000+ subscribers who have indicated a focus on bipolar depression and suicidality. ​ In Q1 2023, the Company announced the participation of Prof. Andrew Nierenberg, M.D., Head of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Dauton Family Center for Bipolar Treatment Innovation as the Principal Investigator of the clinical trial. The Company has now initiated clinical trial sites at Northwestern University (Chicago) and University of Texas, Austin, in addition to commercial research sites. ​ The Company has completed manufacture of all clinical supplies required for its ongoing clinical trials. This initiative is expected to yield stability data sufficient to support a shelf life in excess of two years at time of potential drug launch (should the clinical trials be successful). The completion of this manufacturing milestone may allow the Company to decrease ongoing expenditure associated with manufacturing and development of chemical manufacturing controls. Through the filing of this 10-Q, product stability has continued to support the targeted two-year shelf life at potential drug launch. ​ On June 2, 2023, the Company entered into an Exclusive, Global - Development, Supply, Marketing & License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Alvogen Pharma US, Inc., Alvogen, Inc. and Lotus Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (collectively, “Alvogen”). Under the License Agreement, NRx granted Alvogen an exclusive (even as to NRx and its affiliates) worldwide, transferable and sublicensable license under certain intellectual property (including patents, know-how and trademarks) owned or controlled by NRx to develop (with certain limitations), manufacture, and commercialize NRX-101, for the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality. The term of the license is, on a country-by-country basis, 20 years from the first commercial sale of NRX-101 in such country, extendable by Alvogen for a two-year period upon its request made prior to the expiration of such 20-year period. During the term of the License Agreement, the parties have agreed (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) not to research, develop, seek or obtain any regulatory approval for the manufacturing, marketing, sale, or other commercialization of any product containing a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone in the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality, nor to authorize or assist (including by investing in or otherwise providing funding to) any third party to do so. During the term of the License Agreement, NRx is permitted to develop additional products containing D-cycloserine in combination with one or more other active antidepressant or antipsychotic ingredients for use outside of the field of treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality, such as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or chronic pain in depression, in which case, if NRx wishes to license rights to develop or commercialize such additional products or indications, Alvogen has a right of first negotiation to obtain such a license. ​ Progress on NRX-100 (ketamine) . ​ During Q1 management met with the psychiatry division of the FDA to discuss paths to market for NRX-101 as monotherapy and as sequential therapy following stabilization with ketamine. The FDA indicated that treatment following ketamine would require data sufficient to file a New Drug Application for the use of ketamine as a stabilization agent. 10 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Currently, the FDA has limited data on file that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of ketamine. Accordingly, the Company has established a scientific collaboration with Prof. Marion Leboyer of Paris, France and Prof. Mocrane Abbar of Lyon, France in order to incorporate the results of a 156 -person inpatient trial of intravenous ketamine vs. placebo for the stabilization of patients admitted for acute suicidality (the KETIS trial). The findings of the trial demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in both suicidality (the primary endpoint) and depression (the secondary endpoint) among patients treated with intravenous ketamine compared to those treated with placebo. ​ In Q3, the Company signed a data sharing agreement with the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire De Nîmes in France in order to permit deidentified patient level data to be transmitted by NRx to the FDA for regulatory purposes. The patient-level deidentified data have now been received by the Company and are being assembled in the electronic format required by the FDA. The Company has now negotiated access to similar patient-level data from an NIH-funded US-based clinical trial the findings of which confirm the KETIS trial. The Company believes that these multicenter, randomized prospective trials encompassing more than 240 participants, combined with randomized, prospective data on more than 200 US patients when submitted for review at a patient level will likely be sufficient to demonstrate preliminary safety and efficacy of intravenous ketamine in acutely suicidal patients. Data are expected to be transmitted to FDA by the end of Q4. ​ Submission of a New Drug Application for the use of ketamine is dependent upon submission of a manufacturing file documenting the manufacture of a presentation of ketamine suitable for single-patient use in the treatment of suicidal depression. In November 2023, the Company announced the signing of a development and manufacturing agreement with Nephron Pharmaceuticals (West Columbia, SC) to develop a single patient presentation of ketamine that is expected to overcome some of the formulation deficiencies of existing forms of ketamine (developed for anesthesia) and is expected to have diversion-resistant and tamper-resistant features. The company believes that this latter aspect is important because of the well-known uses of ketamine as a drug of abuse and as a vehicle for date rape. ​ The Company’s current timeline entails the submission of a New Drug Application for ketamine in the first quarter of 2024 with a targeted PDUFA date in Q4 2024. Nephron has considerable experience in the manufacture of ketamine products and, therefore, the Company anticipates that two-year shelf stability at launch may be able to be achieved with six months of real-time accelerated stability. ​ As with the NRX-100 development project, the Company does not anticipate funding this initiative with core NRx assets and is exploring structures for a new entity that would provide current and new investors with both capital appreciation and a royalty stream. In support of that initiative, the Company received a non-binding term sheet in November 2023 for $30 million of new investment capital to support the establishment of a new, publicly-traded entity the shares of which would be initially owned by NRx, current shareholders of NRx, and by new investors. Establishment of this entity is expected to be a topic of discussion at NRx’s upcoming annual meeting of shareholders. ​ New Therapeutic Targets: ​ The Company is exploring three new therapeutic targets for NRX-101 and related drugs: treatment of Chronic Pain, treatment of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), and treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). ​ Treatment of Chronic Pain: ​ The rationale for treatment of chronic pain with DCS is outlined in a 2016 scientific paper published by Schnitzer, et. al. and in the White Paper posted by the Company’s Scientific Leadership (Sappko, et. al.). In brief, DCS as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) antagonist drug has demonstrated extensive nonclinical and early clinical efficacy in: (i) decreasing the response to nociceptive pain (i.e., pain triggered by pain receptors in the body) and (ii) decreasing craving for opioid drugs, with evidence that DCS is both nonaddictive and non-neurotoxic. In order to support its development of NRX-101 for treatment of chronic pain, the Company has licensed US Patent 8,653,120 from Apkarian Technologies and retained 11 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Prof. Apkar Vania Apkarian (the inventor) as a consultant to the Company. The Company believes that its ongoing composition of matter patents additionally apply to the use of NRX-101 in the treatment of chronic pain, as does its patent portfolio related to the treatment of fear memory with NRX-101. ​ In the course of its psychiatry-focused drug development program, the Company completed addiction studies, using standard self administered assays that demonstrate no potential for addiction from NRX-101 and its components. These findings are essential for consideration of NRX-101 as a potential treatment for chronic pain and distinguish NRX-101 from other NMDA antagonist drugs including ketamine and dextromethorphan. ​ The Company is awaiting results of a 200 -person randomized prospective trial funded by the US Department of Defense (NCT 03535688) in which patients with chronic pain were randomly assigned to DCS 400mg/day vs. placebo. The investigators have identified primary completion of this trial as occurring in November 2023, with top-line results. Should these results support efficacy of D-cycloserine in the treatment of chronic low back pain, they are expected to provide a Breakthrough Therapy path towards treatment of chronic pain with DCS and DCS-containing medicines. ​ While awaiting these clinical trial results, the Company filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA and received a “Study May Proceed” letter for an IND-opening trial of NRX-101 in the treatment of Chronic Pain. The review by the FDA Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products identified no new non-clinical requirements beyond those already agreed to with the Division of Psychiatry Products, other than the need to extend certain animal safety studies to the longer (90 day) duration required for the treatment of chronic pain. Should the Department of Defense (DOD)-funded trial demonstrate efficacy, the Company anticipates that these data will also form a basis for a Breakthrough Therapy Designation filing. ​ At the initiative of the US Congress, the National Institutes of Health has established the multibillion dollar HEAL initiative (https://heal.nih.gov/research/clinical-research/eppic-net) combined with a national consortium of clinical trial sites (EPPICNET) to test innovative non-opioid medicines to treat Chronic Pain. The Company has submitted an application to EPPICNET for inclusion of NRX-101 in its clinical trial program. The Company anticipates that the HEAL initiative, additional DOD funding, and other non-dilutive sources of capital may be available, given the national focus on developing non-opioid, non-addictive pain medications. ​ Chronic pain affects more than 50 million American adults, compared to the approximately 3 million who report thoughts of suicide on an annual basis. There has been no new non-opioid class of drugs to treat nociceptive pain in the past two decades and NRX-101 is expected to be the first NMDA-antagonist drug to seek approval for this indication. Today, ketamine is used off label to treat nociceptive pain, despite its clear limitations (addiction, neurotoxicity, hallucination, and the need for IV administration.) Thus, should the DOD data provide encouraging findings, these findings may open a far larger market for NRX-101 than the originally-targeted psychiatry indications. ​ Treatment of PTSD: ​ The Company has previously identified the rationale for treating Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with NMDA antagonist drugs. Based on the near-term data associated with the use of DCS in chronic pain and recent in-licensing of US8653120, management has elected to apply available resources to the chronic pain indication in the near term. ​ Treatment of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and Urosepsis: ​ Although treatment of UTI is quite different from use of NRX-101 to treat Central Nervous System disorders, D-cycloserine was originally developed as an antibiotic because of its role in disrupting the cell wall of certain pathogens. This is true of a number of drugs used in psychiatry today. The use of D-cycloserine as an antibiotic fell out of favor in the 1970s because of the CNS effects caused by its NMDA-blocking properties and because of the widespread availability of 12 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS first and second generation antibiotics. However, D-cycloserine remains unique among antibiotics in its near-100% excretion in the urine and the ability to achieve high urinary tract levels of D-cycloserine with oral administration. DCS is not widely used, in part, because of its known propensity to cause hallucination at therapeutically effective doses. The Company believes that the combination of DCS with a 5-HT2A antagonist in NRX-101 has the potential to treat antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections with decreased propensity to cause unwanted CNS effects. ​ In recent years, increased antibiotic resistance to common pathogens that cause urinary tract infections and urosepsis (i.e., sepsis originating in the urinary tract) has resulted in a marked increase in ComplicatedUTI (cUTI), hospitalization, and death from urosepsis. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 1.7 million Americans contract sepsis each year, of whom at least 350,000 die during their hospitalization or are discharged to hospice (CDC Sepsis Ref.). D-cyloserine (DCS) is currently approved for the treatment of tuberculosis and its label states that it “ may be effective” in treating urinary tract infection on a case-by-case basis with confirmatory laboratory data. In 2015 DCS was demonstrated to be effective against pathogens that are increasingly resistant to first- and second-line antibiotics. During Q3 2023, NRx contracted with Charles River Laboratories (CRL: Wilmington, MA) and tested NRX-101 and its components against resistant pathogens that appear on the Congressionally-mandated Qualified Infectious Disease Product list. NRX-101 appears from this study to be active against antibiotic-resistant E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter . ​ CRL has provided NRx with a research report performed under Good Laboratory Practices documenting in vitro data that we believe meet that published standards of the FDA Qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) program. Qualification for QIDP affords a sponsor five years of additional market exclusivity from FDA, regardless of patent status, together with Fast Track Designation and Priority Review. The Company believes that NRX-101 as an oral medication has the potential to demonstrate benefit in patients who would otherwise require intravenous third and fourth generation antibiotics. The Company believes that there are approximately 3 million patients per year who contract cUTI ​ Based on the in vitro study performed at CRL, the Company has submitted an Investigational New Drug application, requesting QIDP, Fast Track, and Priority Review designation. ​ As with the NRX-100 development project, the Company does not anticipate funding this initiative with core NRx assets and is exploring structures for a new entity that would provide current and new investors with both capital appreciation and a royalty stream. Should the Company succeed in serving 10% of the cUTI market, the Company believes that the potential royalty stream from NRX-101 has the potential to exceed $1 billion annually. ​ ​ 2. Liquidity As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $ 8.9 million in cash. With the completion of enrollment in its clinical trial of NRX-101 for bipolar depression, the Company anticipates a reduction in its monthly cash expenditure. Since inception, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. The Company’s ability to support its ongoing capital needs is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, in order to continue operations. ​ On March 8, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “March Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase up to 3,866,666 shares of Common Stock (the “March Investor Warrants”) in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for a purchase price of $ 0.75 per share (the “March Offering”). The March Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $ 0.75 per share, are exercisable beginning on September 8, 2023 (the “March Initial Exercise Date”) and will expire 5 years from 13 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the March Initial Exercise Date. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the March Offering were approximately $ 2.9 million. The closing of the sale of these securities occurred on March 9, 2023. On June 6, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors (the “June Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 9,670,002 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and warrants to purchase up to 9,670,002 shares of Common Stock (the “June Investor Warrants”). The Common Stock was issued in a registered direct offering for a purchase price of $ 0.65 per share (the “June Offering”) and the June Investor Warrants were offered pursuant to a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The June Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $ 0.6525 per share, are initially exercisable beginning six months following the date of issuance (the “June Initial Exercise Date”) and will expire 5 years from the June Initial Exercise Date. The aggregate net cash proceeds to the Company from the June Offering were approximately $ 5.71 million. ​ On August 28, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Preferred Stock Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain purchasers (the “August Investors”), pursuant to which the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), and one (1) investor warrant (each an “August Investor Warrant”) for every share of Series A Preferred Stock issued. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the August Investor Warrants were offered pursuant to a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Each August Investor Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one (1) share of Common Stock at a purchase price of $ 0.40 per share. The aggregate purchase price for each share of Series A Preferred Stock and associated August Investor Warrant was $ 0.40 . The August Investor Warrants are exercisable starting on the six month anniversary of the date of issuance and will have a term of five years from the date of issuance. The August Investor Warrants may also be exercised during the initial six-month period after issuance, at the option of the August Investors, if the closing share price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds $ 1.20 per share on any trading day. The aggregate net cash proceeds to the Company from the August Offering were approximately $ 1.2 million. ​ The Company’s ongoing clinical activities continue to generate losses and net cash outflows from operations. The Company plans to pursue additional equity or debt financing or refinancing opportunities in 2023 to fund ongoing clinical activities, to meet obligations under its current debt arrangements and for the general corporate purposes of the Company. Such arrangements may take the form of loans, equity offerings, strategic agreements, licensing agreements, joint ventures or other agreements. The sale of equity could result in additional dilution to the Company’s existing shareholders. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms, or that it will be able to refinance its existing debt obligations which could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to a reduction in the Company’s operations. We will continue to carefully monitor the impact of our continuing operations on our working capital needs and debt repayment obligations. As such, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company may raise substantial additional funds, and if it does so, it may do so through one or more of the following: issuance of additional debt or equity and/or the completion of a licensing or other commercial transaction for one of the Company’s product candidates. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. ​ 14 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the convertible note payable, earnout cash liability, stock options, warrants, and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 15 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 11) Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are occasionally invested in certificates of deposit. The Company maintains each of its cash balances with high-quality and accredited financial institutions and accordingly, such funds are not exposed to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. Deposits in financial institutions may, from time to time, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash. The Company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the form of a money market account with a financial institution that management believes to be creditworthy. Revenue Recognition Arrangements may include licenses to intellectual property, research services and participation on joint research committees. The Company evaluates the promised goods or services to determine which promises, or group of promises, represent performance obligations. In contemplation of whether a promised good or service meets the criteria required of a performance obligation, the Company considers the stage of research, the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities and expertise of the customer relative to the underlying intellectual property, and whether the promised goods or services are integral to or dependent on other promises in the contract. When accounting for an arrangement that contains multiple performance obligations, the Company must develop judgmental assumptions, which may include market conditions, timelines and probabilities of regulatory success to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. ​ The Company enters into contractual arrangements that may include licenses to intellectual property and research and development services. When such contractual arrangements are determined to be accounted for in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company evaluates the promised good or services to determine which promises, or group of promises, represent performance obligations. When accounting for an arrangement that contains multiple performance obligations, the Company must develop judgmental assumptions, which may include market conditions, timelines and probabilities of regulatory success to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. ​ The License Agreement with Alvogen as further discussed in Note 6 below is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, it performs the following five steps: ​ i. identify the contract(s) with a customer; ii. identify the performance obligations in the contract; iii. determine the transaction price; iv. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations within the contract; and v. recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 16 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​ The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it determines that it is probable it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. ​ At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within the contract to determine whether each promised good or service is a performance obligation. The promised goods or services in the Company’s arrangements typically consist of a license to intellectual property and research services. The Company may provide options to additional items in such arrangements, which are accounted for as separate contracts when the customer elects to exercise such options, unless the option provides a material right to the customer. Performance obligations are promises in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer that (i) the customer can benefit from on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Goods or services that are not individually distinct performance obligations are combined with other promised goods or services until such combined group of promises meet the requirements of a performance obligation. ​ The Company determines transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. Consideration may be fixed, variable, or a combination of both. At contract inception for arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company estimates the probability and extent of consideration it expects to receive under the contract utilizing either the most likely amount method or expected amount method, whichever best estimates the amount expected to be received. The Company then considers any constraints on the variable consideration and includes in the transaction price variable consideration to the extent it is deemed probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. ​ The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price and recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) control is transferred to the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied. For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. ​ The Company records amounts as accounts receivable when the right to consideration is deemed unconditional. When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded as deferred revenue. ​ The Company’s revenue arrangements include the following: ​ Milestone Payments: At the inception of an agreement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates each milestone to determine when and how much of the milestone to include in the transaction price. The Company first estimates the amount of the milestone payment that the Company could receive using either the expected value or the most likely amount approach. The Company primarily uses the most likely amount approach as that approach is generally most predictive for milestone payments with a binary outcome. Then, the Company considers whether any portion of that estimated amount is subject to the variable consideration constraint (that is, whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty.) The Company updates the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price at each reporting date which includes updating the assessment of the likely amount of consideration and the application of the constraint to reflect current facts and circumstances. ​ 17 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Royalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). ​ Research Services: The Company is incurring research costs in association with the Alvogen agreement. After the First Milestone Payment (as defined in Note 6 below), the Company will be reimbursed for certain costs incurred related to reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs for clinical and non-clinical development activities. The Company will recognize revenue for the reimbursed costs when the First Milestone Payment contingencies have been achieved and the Company has an enforceable claim to the reimbursed costs. ​ See Note 6, “Alvogen Licensing Agreement”, for further information on the application of ASC 606 to the License Agreement. ​ Research and Development Costs ​ The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Convertible Note Payable ​ As permitted under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”), the Company elects to account for its convertible promissory note, which meets the required criteria, at fair value at inception and at each subsequent reporting date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of non-operating loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion of total changes in fair value of the convertible note attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk are determined through specific measurement of periodic changes in the discount rate assumption exclusive of base market changes and are presented as a component of comprehensive income in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As a result of electing the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible promissory notes are expensed as incurred. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock- 18 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. The Company estimates the fair value of restricted stock award grants using the closing trading price of the Company’s common stock on the date of issuance. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured at fair value and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below) was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants (as defined below) was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achieving earnout cash milestone and/or earnout shares milestone at each reporting period (see Notes 9 and 11). Modification of Warrants A change in any of the terms or conditions of warrants is accounted for as a modification. The accounting for incremental fair value of warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification which may result in a reduction of additional paid-in capital, recognition of costs for services rendered, or recognized as a deemed dividend. Preferred Stock ​ In accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock is classified as permanent equity as it is not mandatorily redeemable upon an event that is considered outside of the Company’s control. Further, in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , the Series A Preferred Stock does not meet any of the criteria that would preclude equity classification. The Company concluded that the Series A Preferred Stock is more akin to an equity-type instrument than a debt-type instrument, therefore the conversion features associated with the convertible preferred stock were deemed to be clearly and closely related to the host instrument and were not bifurcated as a derivative under ASC 815. ​ 19 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Loss Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, restricted stock awards and warrants were to vest and be exercised. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, convertible notes, and other dilutive instruments because their effect would be anti-dilutive in the periods in which the Company incurs a net loss. The following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share attributable to common stock for the periods in which a net loss is presented because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30, ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, ​ ​ 2023 2022 2023 2022 Stock options ​ 2,548,849 2,654,579 2,548,849 2,654,579 Restricted stock awards ​ 666,667 ​ 1,000,000 ​ 666,667 ​ 1,000,000 Convertible preferred stock ​ 3,000,000 ​ — ​ 3,000,000 ​ — Common stock warrants ​ 33,021,591 17,521,753 33,021,591 17,521,753 Earnout Shares ​ — ​ 22,209,280 ​ — ​ 22,209,280 Earnout Shares from exercised Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants ​ — ​ 1,229,925 ​ — ​ 1,229,925 ​ Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.

Alvogen Licensing Agreement On June 2, 2023, the Company entered into the License Agreement with Alvogen. The Company and Alvogen are referred to below individually as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.” License Grant Under the License Agreement, the Company granted Alvogen an exclusive (even as to the Company and its affiliates) worldwide, transferable and sublicensable license under certain intellectual property (including patents, know-how and trademarks) owned or controlled by the Company to develop (with certain limitations), manufacture, and commercialize the Company’s candidate therapeutic product, NRX-101, for the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality. The term of the license is, on a country-by-country basis, 20 years from the first commercial sale of NRX-101 in such country, extendable by Alvogen for a two-year period upon its request made prior to the expiration of such 20-year period. During the term of the License Agreement, the Parties agree (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) not to research, develop, seek or obtain any regulatory approval for the manufacturing, marketing, sale, or other commercialization of any product containing a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone in the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality, nor to authorize or assist (including by investing in or otherwise providing funding to) any third party to do so. ​ During the term, the Company is permitted to develop additional products containing D-cycloserine in combination with one or more other active antidepressant or antipsychotic ingredients for use outside of the field of treatment of bipolar 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS depression with suicidality, such as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or chronic pain in depression, in which case, if the Company wishes to license rights to develop or commercialize such additional products or indications, Alvogen has a right of first negotiation to obtain such a license. Term and Termination The License Agreement will remain in force until the earlier to occur of (i) 20 years following the first commercial sale of NRX-101 on a country-by-country basis (which may be extended for a two-year period at Alvogen’s request), and (ii) the date that the agreement is terminated under its early termination provisions. Early termination grounds include, subject to applicable cure periods, a material breach of agreement by the other Party, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other Party, or a party’s reasonable belief that there is an unacceptable risk for harm in humans based upon preclinical safety data or the observation of serious adverse effects in humans. ​ In addition, Alvogen has the right to early termination if (i) the phase 2 study relating to NRX-101 is not completed and/or a successful read out from the study does not occur by March 31, 2024, or (ii) there is no completion of a Type B meeting with the FDA by March 31, 2024. Alvogen may also terminate upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the Company at any time after the First Milestone Payment (as defined below) has been made. The Company also has the right to terminate the License Agreement if the current phase 2 study successfully concludes prior to March 31, 2024 and the Type B meeting with the FDA is completed by March 31, 2024 and Alvogen does not notify the Company within 60 days that it wishes to proceed with the development of NRX-101 or has not paid the First Milestone Payment. ​ Upon expiration or termination of the License Agreement, the intellectual property rights licensed to Alvogen under the License Agreement will revert to the Company, and all other rights and obligations of each of the parties will immediately cease, except for ant outstanding amounts owed as of the time of such expiration or termination. Upon termination, Alvogen will grant to the Company an exclusive irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, transferrable license under the NDA rights to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, or commercialize the product in the field of bipolar depression with suicidality. Such reversion license would be granted by Alvogen to the Company in exchange for an equitable royalty payable by the Company to Alvogen that would be negotiated and agreed in good faith by the parties within 30 business days of such matter being presented to them. Milestone Payments In exchange for the license grant and the participation of the Company in the development, regulatory and commercial activities described below, Alvogen will pay the Company an initial $ 10 million cash payment upon the later of a positive data read-out from the Company’s ongoing Phase 2b/3 clinical trial and completion of the Type B meeting with the U.S. FDA (the “First Milestone Payment”). A second milestone payment of $ 5 million (the “Approval Payment”) is due upon Alvogen’s receipt of a copy of the FDA’s notice of NDA Approval for Product with the label indication for the treatment of bipolar depression with sub-acute or acute suicidality. Additional bonus milestone payments of increasing amounts up to $ 330 million will be payable upon the achievement of net sales targets measured over the trailing four quarters. Alvogen also will pay royalties (as described below) to the Company based on the net sales of NRX-101, with a reduction in royalties on a country-by-country basis upon expiration or termination of the Company’s patent protection on the NRX-101 composition. Royalties Subject to certain adjustments for sublicensing and other deductions, commencing on the first commercial sale of NRX-101, Alvogen has agreed to pay to the Company tiered royalties calculated on the basis of a percentage, ranging from the low to mid-teens, of annual net sales of NRX-101 measured over the trailing four quarters. In addition, if Alvogen sublicenses NRX-101 in any country other than the U.S. (in which the royalty rates described above will apply), Alvogen 22 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS will pay the Company a percentage of any and all consideration received by Alvogen or its affiliates from sublicensing any of the rights granted. Development and Regulatory Activities Prior to payment of the First Milestone Payment by Alvogen to the Company, each Party has agreed to perform, at its own cost, certain development activities using diligent efforts and in accordance with applicable then-current good manufacturing and other applicable practices, laws and regulations, with the goal of supporting the preparation and filing of an NDA and obtaining regulatory approval for NRX-101. Until the payment of the First Milestone Payment, the Company has the sole right to control and responsibility for all regulatory matters relating to NRX-101, at its sole cost and expense, and the Company shall own all regulatory materials and own all worldwide regulatory approvals for NRX-101. ​ After the payment of the First Milestone Payment, Alvogen has the sole right and responsibility, at its cost and expense, for all regulatory matters relating to NRX-101, and Alvogen will own all regulatory materials and all regulatory approvals for the product in the licensed territory (and the Company will assign all of its rights in any regulatory materials to Alvogen). Each party has committed to reasonably cooperate with the other in carrying out the development and regulatory activities outlined in the development plan. In addition, Alvogen has agreed to fund the next registrational study of NRX-101 in the field of treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality. ​ Upon NDA approval of the product in the U.S., Alvogen has agreed to use diligent efforts to commercialize NRX-101 in the U.S., and, for 24 months following such approval, in other countries in the territory upon regulatory approval in each such country. If Alvogen does not commercialize NRX-101 in a country outside of the U.S. in the foregoing 24-month period, then the license may revert back to the Company with respect to such country and the Company would pay Alvogen tiered royalties in the low to mid-teens based on net sales of NRX-101 in such country. The Parties will also enter into a pharmacovigilance agreement to ensure compliance with safety reporting requirements of all applicable regulatory agencies globally with respect to the commercialization of NRX-101. Commercial Activities Under the License Agreement, the Company is responsible for and will control the manufacturing of the NRX-101 commercial product and for qualification and regulatory-related activities necessary for the manufacture of the product. The Parties intend to enter into a clinical supply agreement (and a related quality agreement) on reasonable and customary terms, in which the Company will supply Alvogen raw materials and/or finished product without any markup to the future supply price from the Company’s current contract manufacturer. Similarly, prior to initiation of the first Phase 3 study for the commercial product, the Parties will enter into a commercial supply agreement (and a related quality agreement) on reasonable and customary terms, in which the Company will supply Alvogen raw materials and/or finished product without any markup to the future supply price from NRx’s current contract manufacturer. At any time after NDA approval, Alvogen may elect to manufacture, fill and package the product itself or through a third-party supplier subject to the prior approval of the Company. In such case, the parties may also work together to establish a written manufacturing technology transfer plan to transfer manufacturing technology from the Company or the Company’s contract manufacturer to Alvogen or Alvogen’s designated third party supplier. The Company has agreed, as a part of its manufacturing commitments, to make available its qualified technical personnel to consult with Alvogen to complete transfer of the manufacturing technology if required under the License Agreement. ​ Following NDA approval, Alvogen will control and be responsible for advertising, marketing, promotion and marketing, pricing, and terms of sale for the product, all at Alvogen’s sole expense. Alvogen has committed to not shift, allocate, price or discount sales of the product for the purpose of reducing or disadvantaging the net sales of the product in order to reduce the payments owed by Alvogen to the Company under the License Agreement. ​ 23 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of September 30, 2023, the Company has not achieved any milestones nor recognized any revenue associated with the License Agreement. 7. Debt Convertible Note On November 4, 2022, we issued an 9 % redeemable promissory note (as amended, the “Note”) to Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“Streeterville”), for an aggregate principal amount of $ 11.0 million. The Note matures 18 months from the date of issuance subject to certain acceleration provisions. The Note carries an original issue discount of $ 1.0 million which was deducted from the principal balance of the Note. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Note was $ 10.0 million after transaction costs including the original issue discount, legal and other fees are included. The Company has the option to prepay the Note during the term by paying an amount equal to 110 % of the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date. The noteholder has the right to redeem up to $ 1.0 million of the outstanding balance of the Note per month starting six months after the issuance date. Payments may be made by the Company at their option in: (i) in cash with a 10 % premium for the amount redeemed, (ii) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of Common Stock with the number of redemption shares being equal to the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Conversion Price (as defined below), or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The “Redemption Conversion Price” on any given redemption date equals 85 % multiplied by the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average prices per share of the common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date that the noteholder delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the Note. Beginning May 1, 2023, in the event (a) the daily dollar trading volume of the common stock of the Company on any given trading day is at least fifty percent (50%) greater than the lower of (i) the median daily dollar trading volume over the previous ten (10) trading days or (ii) the daily dollar trading volume on the trading day immediately preceding the date of measurement or (b) if the closing trade price on any given trading day is at least thirty percent (30%) greater than the Nasdaq Minimum Price, then the lender will be entitled to redeem over the following ten (10) trading days an amount of indebtedness then outstanding under the Note equal to twice the monthly redemption amount of $ 1.0 million solely by payment by stock, if permitted under the agreement, subject to the Maximum Percentage (as defined in the Note) and other ownership limitations. On March 30, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Note (the “First Amendment”), pursuant to which the Maximum Percentage was set at 9.99 % of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a given date. On July 7, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment #2 to the Note with Streeterville (the “Second Amendment”). Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company agreed to amend the redemption provisions of the Note to provide that the Company would pay to Streeterville an amount in cash equal to $ 1,800,000 on or before July 10, 2023, which amount was paid on July 10, 2023. In addition, the Company agreed that, beginning on or before July 31, 2023, and on or before the last day of each month until December 31, 2023 (the “Minimum Payment Period”), we would pay Streeterville an amount equal to $ 400,000 in cash (a “Minimum Payment”), less any amount satisfied by the delivery of Redemption Conversion Shares (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Streeterville may also submit a request for redemption of up to an aggregate of $ 1,000,000 per month (the “Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount” and, together with the Minimum Payment Amount, the “Redemption Amounts”) in accordance with the terms of the Note. However, the portion of each Minimum Payment that is not satisfied by the delivery of Redemption Conversion Shares is the maximum amount of cash we will be required to pay in accordance with the Second Amendment during the Minimum Payment Period. The redemption of the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount in excess of the Minimum Amount may be satisfied by the delivery of additional Redemption Conversion Shares. During the Minimum Payment Period, the Company is permitted to pay the Redemption Amounts in the form of shares of common stock of the Company (the “Redemption Conversion Shares”) calculated on the basis of the Redemption 24 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Conversion Price (as defined in the Note) without regard to the existence of an Equity Conditions Failure. Moreover, the Redemption Premium (as defined in the Note) will continue to apply to the Redemption Amounts. This amendment was deemed to be a debt modification in accordance with ASC 470, Debt, which will be accounted for prospectively. The modification does not result in recognition of a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations but does impact interest expense recognized in the future. ​ The Note contains certain Trigger Events (as defined in the Note) that generally, if uncured within five trading days, may result in an event of default in accordance with the terms of the Notes (such event, an “Event of Default”). Upon an Event of a Default, the Lender may consider the Note immediately due and payable. Upon an Event of Default, the interest rate may also be increased to the lesser of 18 % per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the Note’s terms and there were no Events of Default. ​ Due to these embedded features within the Note, the Company elected to account for the Note at fair value at inception. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. The discount to the principal amount is included in the carrying value of the Note. During 2022, the Company recorded a debt discount of approximately $ 1.0 million upon issuance of the Note for the original issue discount of $ 1.0 million. As a result of electing the fair value option, any direct costs and fees related to the Note was expensed as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a change in fair value of the Note of approximately $ 2.8 and $ 0.4 million, respectively, which was recognized in other income (expense) on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Company’s election of the fair value option. ​ During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made cash interest payments on the Note of approximately $ 0.5 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively, and issued shares of Common Stock as interest repayment of $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made cash principal repayments on the Note of approximately $ 1.7 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, and issued shares of Common Stock as principal repayment of $ 0.9 million and $ 0.9 million, respectively. ​ 25 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Commitments and Contingencies Exclusive License Agreement The Company has entered into a License Agreement with Apkarian Technologies to in-license US Patent 8,653,120 that claims the use of D-cycloserine for the treatment of chronic pain in exchange for a commitment to pay milestones and royalties as development milestones are reached in the field of chronic pain. The patent is supported by extensive nonclinical data and early clinical data that suggest the potential for NMDA antagonist drugs, such as NRX-101 to decrease both chronic pain and neuropathic pain while potentially decreasing craving for opioids. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has recorded $ 0.2 million worth of expenses relating to the licensure of the patent recorded in R&D patents expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. ​ Operating Lease The Company leases office space on a month-to-month basis.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company has fully paid NJ Health the total committed amount under this agreement. ​ 26 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Relief Therapeutics for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The Collaboration Agreement provides for funding by Relief Therapeutics of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the Collaboration Agreement. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics filed a lawsuit against the Company and its former CEO claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, which was followed by a counter claim from the Company for breach and repudiation of the Collaboration Agreement by Relief Therapeutics. On November 12, 2022, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG and Relief Therapeutics International (the “Relief Parties”) to settle the outstanding lawsuit with respect to the Collaboration Agreement. Under the APA, the Company transferred to the Relief Parties all of the Company’s interest in ZYESAMI (or the “Product” as such term is defined in the Collaboration Agreement), including intellectual property, FDA applications, clinical trial data, drug and API inventory and certain contractual rights. The Company has agreed to refrain from developing any product for any indication that uses or otherwise exploits the Product without the Relief Parties’ consent. The Relief Parties have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, market, and commercialize the Product, and have sole discretion to select the indications for which they will seek to develop the Product. Although the Company intends to monitor the progress of the Relief Parties under the APA and enforce the Company’s rights thereunder, there can be no assurances that the Relief Parties will be successful at commercializing the Product. Upon commercial launch of the Product by the Relief Parties or any of their affiliates, licensees or sublicensees (or upon authorization of use for any indication of the Product other than COVID-19), the Company is entitled to receive milestone payments in stages up to an aggregate amount of $ 13.0 million. The Relief Parties have also agreed to pay royalties to the Company on aggregate net sales of all Products, subject to a cap on royalty payments of $ 30.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, Relief is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue the Company’s existing Right to Try Program until December 2024. Mutual indemnity provisions in the APA will protect each party from any breaches of the settlement arrangements by the other party, provided, that the Company’s indemnity obligations will not start until the Relief Parties have begun making royalty or milestone payments to the Company, subject to certain exceptions. With respect to the Company, there is an indemnity threshold such that the Company will not be liable for any indemnity claims until such claims are in excess of $ 0.5 million (and then only for the amount above $ 0.5 million). The Company’s indemnity obligation is capped at $ 2.0 million with respect to breaches of representations and warranties and $ 3.0 million with respects to breaches of covenants or other agreements. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s indemnity obligations cannot exceed the amount that the Relief Parties actually pay to the Company for milestone and royalty payments. The parties closed the APA in December 2022 at which time all claims and counterclaims between the Company and the Relief Parties were dismissed with prejudice. Legal Proceedings From time to time the Company is involved in litigation, claims, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur. 27 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

The GEM Agreement was never activated because of differences between the Hong Kong law under which the agreement was drafted and US Securities law. On August 12, 2022, the Company received a demand for arbitration (the “Demand”) from GEM. The Demand claimed that NeuroRx, failed to satisfy its obligation to pay GEM a commitment fee in the amount of HK$ 15,000,000 (approximately US$ 1,919,565 at current exchange rates) pursuant to the GEM Agreement. ​ On July 17, 2023, NeuroRx and GEM entered into a settlement and release agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties agreed to dismiss the arbitration proceeding with prejudice.

Common Stock Warrants ​ Substitute Warrants In connection with the Merger, each warrant to purchase shares of common stock of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into a warrant, based on the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ), that will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant (the “Substitute Warrants”). As these Substitute Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Substitute Warrants were recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Merger) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , with changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in the period of change. The Company recognized a gain and loss on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had 3,450,000 Public Warrants outstanding (the “Public Warrants”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the Effective Time of the Merger and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon their redemption or liquidation of the Company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 no Public Warrants were exercised. Assumed Private Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Private Placement Warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”). The Private Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity 30 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS shares. The Company classifies the Private Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023. The Company measures the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s statements of operations for the current period. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.2 million, respectively. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of the fair value measurement of the Company’s warrant liabilities. Investor Warrants ​ As discussed above, on March 8, 2023, in conjunction with the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, the Company issued 3,866,666 March Investor Warrants which were classified in stockholder’s equity. The measurement of fair value of the March Investor Warrants were determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 0.72 , exercise price of $ 0.75 , term of five and a half years, volatility of 123.6 %, risk-free rate of 4.34 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). The March Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $ 0.75 per share, are initially exercisable beginning six months following the March Initial Exercise Date and will expire five and a half years from the March Initial Exercise Date. The grant date fair value of these March Investor Warrants was estimated to be $ 2.4 million on March 8, 2023 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital. The Company issued warrants to the Placement Agent with an exercise price of $ 0.81 (the “June Placement Agent Warrants”). As these June Placement Agent Warrants were issued for services provided in facilitating the June Offering, the Company recorded the fair value of such June Placement Agent Warrants of approximately $ 0.1 million as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 0.53 , exercise price of $ 0.81 , term of five and a half years, volatility of 175.1 %, risk-free rate of 3.85 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). ​ In connection with the June Offering, the Company also entered into a warrant amendment agreement (the “Warrant Amendment Agreement”) with certain investors to amend certain existing warrants to purchase up to 9,622,778 shares of Common Stock that were previously issued in August 2021 and February 2022 to such investors, with an exercise price of $ 3.07 and $ 12.00 per share, respectively (the “Amended Warrants”) as follows: (i) lower the exercise price of the Amended Warrants to $ 0.6525 per share, and (ii) provide that the Amended Warrants, as amended, will not be exercisable until six months following the closing date of the June Offering, and (iii) extend the original expiration date of the Amended Warrants so that they will terminate five and one half years from the closing of the June Offering. ​ The Company recorded the incremental change in fair value of such Amended Warrants of $ 1.7 million as a cost of capital to issue the June Investor Warrants. The measurement of fair value for the Amended Warrants was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 0.53 , exercise price of $ 0.65 , term of five and a half years, volatility of 175.1 %, risk-free rate of 3.85 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). ​ As discussed above, On August 28, 2023, in conjunction with the issuance and sale of 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company issued 3,000,000 August Investor Warrants which were classified in stockholder’s equity. The measurement of fair value of the August Investor Warrants were determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 0.30 , exercise price of $ 0.40 , term of five years , volatility of 175.1 % , risk-free rate of 4.38 % , and expected dividend rate of 0 % ). The grant 31 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS date fair value of these August Investor Warrants was estimated to be $ 0.8 million on August 28, 2023 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital. ​ The following table provides the activity for all warrants for the respective periods. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Weighted ​ Aggregate ​ ​ ​ Remaining ​ Average ​ Intrinsic Value ​ Total Warrants ​ Term ​ Exercise Price ​ (in thousands) Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 16,484,923 ​ 3.59 ​ $ 6.49 ​ ​ — Issued 3,866,666 ​ 4.69 ​ ​ 0.75 ​ ​ — Outstanding as of March 31, 2023 20,351,589 ​ 3.65 ​ ​ 5.40 ​ ​ — Issued 9,670,002 ​ 4.94 ​ ​ 0.65 ​ ​ — Outstanding as of June 30, 2023 30,021,591 ​ 4.36 ​ $ 2.51 ​ ​ — Issued 3,000,000 ​ 4.92 ​ ​ 0.40 ​ ​ — Outstanding as of September 30, 2023 33,021,591 ​ 4.28 ​ $ 2.32 ​ $ — ​ ​ ​ 10. Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that were subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), based on the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ). Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 5.10 per share. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan As of September 30, 2023, 6,713,608 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the Company’s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of January 1, 2023, 664,430 shares were added to the 2021 Plan under an evergreen feature that automatically increases the reserve with additional shares of Common Stock for future issuance under the Incentive Plan each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) 1 % of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) a smaller number of shares determined by the Board. As of September 30, 2023, 5,749,394 shares have been awarded and 964,214 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. 32 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and has limited company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the limited company-specific historical volatility and implied volatility as well as historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. The expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company did not grant any stock options during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023. ​ The following assumptions were used for the year ended December 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, 2022 ​ ​ ​ ​ Exercise price ​ $ 0.51 -$ 3.10 Risk-free rate of interest 1.8 %- 4.36 % Expected term (years) 5.3 - 6.5 Expected stock price volatility 94.9 %- 147.8 % Dividend yield — ​ The following table summarizes the Company’s employee and non-employee stock option activity under the Plan for the following periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Number of shares ​ Weighted average exercise price ​ Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) ​ Aggregate intrinsic value (in thousands) Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 ​ 2,548,849 ​ $ 3.32 ​ 8.4 ​ $ 618 Outstanding as of September 30, 2023 ​ 2,548,849 ​ $ 3.32 ​ 7.6 ​ $ 10 Options vested and exercisable as of September 30, 2023 ​ 2,022,085 ​ $ 3.68 ​ 7.3 ​ $ 10 ​ The weighted average grant date fair value per share for employee stock and non-employee option grants during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $ 0.64 and $ 1.55 , respectively. At September 30, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation related to unvested employee and non-employee stock option awards granted, was $ 0.8 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.6 years. 33 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of the Note was estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022. Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The estimated fair value of the money market account represents a Level 1 measurement. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and earnout cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements. The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands): 34 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black Scholes options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The 35 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical and peer company volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero -coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero. The significant inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, 2023 Stock price on valuation date ​ $ 0.26 - 0.66 Exercise price per share ​ $ 3.48 - 11.50 Expected life ​ 0.02 - 3.15 Volatility ​ 55.0 - 175.1 % Risk-free rate ​ 3.79 - 5.40 % Dividend yield ​ 0.00 % Fair value of warrants ​ $ 0.00 - 79.34 ​ A reconciliation of warrant liabilities is included below (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, 2023 Balance as of December 31, 2022 ​ $ 37 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ ( 12 ) Balance as of March 31, 2023 ​ ​ 25 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ 11 Balance as of June 30, 2023 ​ ​ 36 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ ( 26 ) Balance as of September 30, 2023 ​ $ 10 ​ ​ 12. Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of September 30, 2023. 13. Related Party Transactions Glytech Agreement The Company licenses patents that are owned by Glytech, LLC (“Glytech”), pursuant to a license agreement (the “Glytech Agreement”). Glytech is owned by a co-founder and former director of the Company. The Glytech Agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 36 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2022, the Company paid Glytech $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively, for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid Glytech $ 0.2 million and $ 0.2 million, respectively, for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. These support services are ongoing. The Fourth Amendment to the Glytech Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2020, includes an equity value-triggered transfer of Excluded Technology from Glytech to NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Excluded Technology is defined in the Glytech Agreement as any technology, and any know-how related thereto, covered in the licensed patents that do not recite either D-cycloserine or lurasidone individually or jointly. This definition would cover pharmaceutical formulations, including some that NRx Pharmaceuticals considers “pipeline” or “future product” opportunities, that contain a combination of pharmaceutical components different from those contained in NRX-100 and NRX-101. On November 6, 2022 the Glytech Agreement was amended whereby Glytech agreed to transfer and assign the remainder of the Licensed Technology and the Excluded Technology to NRx Pharmaceuticals for no additional consideration at any time upon receipt of written notice from the Company if, on or prior to January 31, 2023, (i) the value of the Glytech equity holdings in NRx Pharmaceuticals (the “Glytech Equity”) has an aggregate liquidity value of at least $ 50 million for twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding any given date and (ii) there are no legal or contractual restrictions on selling all of the securities represented by the Glytech Equity then applicable to Glytech (or reasonably foreseeable to be applicable to Glytech within the following twenty trading days). The Glytech Agreement was amended to extend the period to meet these conditions until August 6, 2023 and the parties are currently negotiating an extension to meet these conditions. Consulting Agreement with Dr. Jonathan Javitt The Chief Scientist of the Company, Dr. Jonathan Javitt, is a major shareholder in the Company and a member of the Board of Directors. Therefore, his services are deemed to be a related party transaction. He served the Company on a full-time basis as CEO under an employment agreement with the Company until March 8, 2022 and currently serves under a Consulting Agreement with the Company as Chief Scientist thereafter and received compensation of $ 0.2 million and $ 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $ 0.7 million and $ 0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On March 29, 2023, the Consulting Agreement dated March 8, 2022 (the “Javitt Consulting Agreement”) between the Company and Dr. Jonathan Javitt was amended to extend the term of the Agreement until March 8, 2024 with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless one party or the other provides notice of non-renewal. The amendment also provided for payment at the rate of $ 0.6 million per year, payable monthly (i.e., less than $ 0.1 million per month), and a performance-based annual bonus with a minimum target of $ 0.3 million, at the discretion of the Board and upon satisfactory performance of the services. The annual bonus for 2023, if any, is payable in March 2024, will be pro-rated from the start of the extension period and is subject to Dr. Javitt’s continued engagement by the Company. The amendment also provides, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors, for a grant of 500,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company under the Company’s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The restrictions are performance based, and half of the restricted shares ( 250,000 ) shall have the restrictions removed on the New Drug Application Date (as defined below) and the remaining half ( 250,000 ) will have the restrictions removed on the New Drug Approval Date (as defined below). As of September 30, 2023, the Board of Directors has not approved the grant of restricted stock. The term “New Drug Application Date” means the date upon which the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) files the Company’s new drug application for the Antidepressant Drug Regimen (as defined below) for review. The term “New Drug Approval Date” means date upon which the FDA has both approved the Company’s Antidepressant Drug Regimen and listed the Company’s Antidepressant Drug Regimen in the FDA’s “Orange Book”. The term “Antidepressant Drug Regimen” means NRX-101, a proprietary fixed-dose combination capsule of d-cycloserine and Lurasidone, administered 37 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Subsequent Events ​ Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements ​ On October 17, 2023, the Company received formal notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) indicating that, based upon the Company’s non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Rule”), the Company’s securities were subject to delisting unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel(the “Panel”). The Company plans to timely request a hearing before the Panel, which request will stay any further action by Nasdaq pending the issuance of a decision by the Panel and the expiration of any extension that the Panel may grant to the Company following the hearing. The Company is diligently working to evidence compliance with the Rule; however, there can be no assurance that the Panel will determine to continue the Company’s listing or that the Company will be able to evidence compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the time period of any extension that may be granted by the Panel. The Company has now been granted a hearing date of January 4, 2024 at which the Company will present its plan for achieving Nasdaq continued listing requirements. The Nasdaq has invited the Company to submit a short-form written response detailing that compliance plan, which at Nasdaq’s election may substitute for the January 4 hearing. The Company has submitted this short form plan to the Nasdaq. ​ ​ ​ 38 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition and plan of operations together with NRx Pharmaceuticals' unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (“BRPA”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals” or the “Company”). The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company which applies innovative science to known molecules to develop life-saving medicines through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company’s foundation product, NRX-101 (D-cycloserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). NRX-101 is covered by multiple U.S. and foreign patents, including a Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx Pharmaceuticals by Glytech, LLC. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Biomarker Letter of Support, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline and stabilization in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS in combination with antidepressants. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a Phase 2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on data from the STABIL-B study (NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the active ingredient used in the market leading branded bipolar depression agent) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. In March 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals announced a primary focus on its psychiatry franchise and the late-stage development of NRX-101 for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality. NRX-101 is a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine, an NMDA antagonist, and lurasidone, a 5-HT 2A atypical antipsychotic and antidepressant, for the maintenance of remission from severe bipolar depression following initial stabilization with ketamine. The previously undiscovered synergy between these two drug classes in the treatment of CNS disorders, combined with the efficacy of D-cycloserine in the treatment of depression and PTSD, is the subject of 47 issued patents and more than 43 pending patents owned by or licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. ​ NRX-101 in Severe Bipolar Depression in Patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) After Initial Stabilization with ketamine ​ ​ 39 Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NRX-101 Indication – Bipolar Depression in Patients with Sub-acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SSIB) ​ ​ ​ Consolidated NRX-101 Program in Suicidal Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression 40 Table of Contents NRX-101 Indication – Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ​ ​ ​ Licensure of a US Patent to Support Use of NRX-101 ​ The Company has entered into a License Agreement with Apkarian Technologies to in-license US Patent 8,653,120 that claims the use of D-cycloserine for the treatment of chronic pain in exchange for a commitment to pay milestones and royalties as development milestones are reached in the field of chronic pain. The patent is supported by extensive nonclinical data and early clinical data that suggest the potential for NMDA antagonist drugs, such as NRX-101 to decrease both chronic pain and neuropathic pain while potentially decreasing craving for opioids. ​ The Company has signed an agreement with Dr. Vania Apkarian, Professor of Physiology, Anesthesia, Surgery, and Neuroscience Institute, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine to join the NRx Pharmaceuticals Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). ​ As of September 30, 2023, the Company has recorded $0.2 million worth of expenses relating to the licensure of the patent recorded in R&D patents expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. ​ Financial Results Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $6.1 million and $9.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $25.8 million and $29.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals had an accumulated deficit of $248.8 million. ​ Going Concern The Company’s ongoing clinical activities continue to generate losses and net cash outflows from operations. The Company plans to pursue additional equity or debt financing or refinancing opportunities in 2023 to fund ongoing clinical activities, to meet obligations under its current debt arrangements and for the general corporate purposes of the Company. Such arrangements may take the form of loans, equity offerings, strategic agreements, licensing agreements, joint ventures or other agreements. The sale of equity could result in additional dilution to the Company’s existing shareholders. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable 41 Table of Contents terms, or that it will be able to refinance its existing debt obligations which could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to a reduction in the Company’s operations. We will continue to carefully monitor the impact of our continuing operations on our working capital needs and debt repayment obligations. As such, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company may raise substantial additional funds, and if it does so, it may do so through one or more of the following: issuance of additional debt or equity and/or the completion of a licensing or other commercial transaction for one of the Company’s product candidates. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. ​ Nasdaq Listing Requirements On July 20, 2023, we received a written notification (the “Notice”) from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that NRx Pharmaceuticals is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) – Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS”) because the Company had not maintained a minimum MVLS of $50,000,000 for the last thirty-three (33) consecutive business days. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), we have been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until January 22, 2024, to regain compliance with the MVLS requirement. To regain compliance, our MVLS must meet or exceed $50,000,000 for a minimum period of ten consecutive business days prior to January 22, 2024. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period Nasdaq will provide notice that our shares of common stock will be subject to delisting and may potentially be traded on the Over-the-Counter market thereafter. On October 17, 2023, we received formal notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) indicating that, based upon our non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Rule”), our securities were subject to delisting unless we timely request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). The Company has now been granted a hearing date of January 4, 2024 at which the Company will present its plan for achieving Nasdaq continued listing requirements. The Nasdaq has invited the Company to submit a short-form written response detailing that compliance plan, which at Nasdaq’s election may substitute for the January 4 hearing. The Company has submitted this short form plan to the Nasdaq. We are diligently working to evidence compliance with the Rule; however, there can be no assurance that the Panel will determine to continue the Company’s listing or that the Company will be able to evidence compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the time period of any extension that may be granted by the Panel.

NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of NRX-101 will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations. Streeterville Note On November 4, 2022, we issued an 9% redeemable promissory note (as amended, the “Note”) to Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“Streeterville”), for an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 million. The Note matures 18 months from the date of issuance subject to certain acceleration provisions. The Note carries an original issue discount of $1.0 million which was deducted from the principal balance of the Note.

The Company has the option to prepay the Note during the term by paying an amount equal to 110% of the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date. The noteholder has the right to redeem up to $1.0 million of the outstanding balance of the Note per month starting six months after the issuance date. Payments may be made by the Company at their option in: (i) in cash with a 10% premium for the amount redeemed, (ii) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of Common Stock with the number of redemption shares being equal to the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Conversion Price (as defined below), or (iii) a combination of 45 Table of Contents cash and shares of common stock. The “Redemption Conversion Price” on any given redemption date equals 85% multiplied by the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average prices per share of the common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date that the noteholder delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the Note. Beginning May 1, 2023, in the event (a) the daily dollar trading volume of the common stock of the Company on any given trading day is at least fifty percent (50%) greater than the lower of (i) the median daily dollar trading volume over the previous ten (10) trading days or (ii) the daily dollar trading volume on the trading day immediately preceding the date of measurement or (b) if the closing trade price on any given trading day is at least thirty percent (30%) greater than the Nasdaq Minimum Price, then the lender will be entitled to redeem over the following ten (10) trading days an amount of indebtedness then outstanding under the Note equal to twice the monthly redemption amount of $1.0 million solely by payment by stock, if permitted under the agreement, subject to the Maximum Percentage (as defined in the Note) and other ownership limitations. On March 30, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Note (the “First Amendment”), pursuant to which the Maximum Percentage was set at 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a given date. On July 7, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment #2 to the Note with Streeterville (the “Second Amendment”).

In addition, the Company agreed that, beginning on or before July 31, 2023, and on or before the last day of each month until December 31, 2023 (the “Minimum Payment Period”), we would pay Streeterville an amount equal to $400,000 in cash (a “Minimum Payment”), less any amount satisfied by the delivery of Redemption Conversion Shares (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Streeterville may also submit a request for redemption of up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 per month (the “Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount” and, together with the Minimum Payment Amount, the “Redemption Amounts”) in accordance with the terms of the Note. However, the portion of each Minimum Payment that is not satisfied by the delivery of Redemption Conversion Shares is the maximum amount of cash we will be required to pay in accordance with the Second Amendment during the Minimum Payment Period. The redemption of the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount in excess of the Minimum Amount may be satisfied by the delivery of additional Redemption Conversion Shares. During the Minimum Payment Period, the Company is permitted to pay the Redemption Amounts in the form of shares of common stock of the Company (the “Redemption Conversion Shares”) calculated on the basis of the Redemption Conversion Price (as defined in the Note) without regard to the existence of an Equity Conditions Failure.

In accordance with GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the earnout cash liability, stock-based compensation, and the valuation of warrants. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. Stock-based compensation We measure stock option awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value is the fair market value per share as of the grant date based on the closing trading price for the Company’s stock. The straight-line method of expense recognition is applied to awards with service-only conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock-based awards, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock-based awards, and our expected dividend yield. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded warrants on our common stock and historical volatility of a set of our publicly traded peer companies. We estimate the expected term of our options using the ""simplified"" method for awards that qualify as ""plain-vanilla"" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 49 Table of Contents The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Warrant liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, or date of modification, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the earnout cash milestone and earnout shares milestone probabilities of achievement at each reporting period. Convertible note payable As permitted under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”), the Company elects to account for its convertible promissory note, which meets the required criteria, at fair value at inception and at each subsequent reporting date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of non-operating loss in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of electing the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible promissory notes are expensed as incurred. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the convertible note payable represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, the change in fair value of the convertible note payable recorded to other (income) expense could be materially different in the future. ​ 50 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation as of September 30 , 2023 under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who serves as our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30 , 2023 in providing reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ​ There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30 , 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company’s systems evolve with its business. ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended September 30 , 2023 included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved. Item 1A. Risk Factors ​ We have disclosed the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report on Form 10-K”). There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or may not be able to assess, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. In addition to the risk factors detailed above, the following risk factors should also be considered: ​ 51 Table of Contents ​ Primarily as a result of our losses incurred to date, our expected continued future losses, and limited cash balances, we have included disclosure in our consolidated financial statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We do not have sufficient cash on hand and available liquidity to meet our obligations through the twelve months following the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. In the absence of financing, management anticipates that existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet operating and liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other factors, the sale of the shares of our Common Stock or obtaining alternate financing. Any failure or delay to secure such financing could force us to delay, limit or terminate our operations, make reductions in our workforce, liquidate all or a portion of our assets and/or seek protection under Chapters 7 or 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. ​ ​ Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Note to Streeterville Capital, LLC, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to issue securities during the term of the Note. Specifically, we agreed to obtain the Lender’s consent prior to issuing any debt securities or certain equity securities where the pricing of such equity securities is tied to the public trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, we also must offer the Lender the right to purchase up to 10% of future equity and debt securities offerings, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, during the term of the Note. ​ Further, we have agreed to make certain monthly redemption payments at the request of the Lender. Our failure to pay such redemptions, when due, may result in defaults under our agreements with the Lender. If we are in default with respect to our obligations under the Note, the Lender may consider the Note immediately due and payable and may elect to substantially increase the interest rate of the Note. We may not have the required funds to pay the required note redemptions and such redemptions, or penalties in connection therewith, may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, and ability to pay our other debts as they come due. ​ ​ Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. including the requirement that our Common Stock maintain an average minimum bid price of $1.00. In the past, we have received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq for failing to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00, but we have since regained compliance. On July 20, 2023, we received a written notification (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) – Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS”) because we had not maintained a minimum MVLS of $50,000,000 for the previous 33 consecutive business days. We have been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until January 22, 2024, to regain compliance with the MVLS requirement. To regain compliance, our MVLS must meet or exceed $50,000,000 for a minimum period of ten consecutive business days prior to January 22, 2024. Additionally, on October 17, 2023, we received notice from Nasdaq indicating that, based upon our non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), our securities were subject to delisting unless we timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. The Company has now been granted a hearing date of January 4, 2024 at which the Company will present its plan for achieving Nasdaq continued listing requirements. The Nasdaq has invited the Company to submit a short-form written response detailing that compliance plan, which at Nasdaq’s election may substitute for the January 4 hearing. The Company has submitted this short form plan to the Nasdaq. If our Common Stock is delisted, an active trading market for our Common Stock may not be sustained and the 52 Table of Contents market price of our Common Stock could decline. Delisting of our Common Stock could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our Common Stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. ​ ​ We are currently involved in, and in the future may become involved in, legal proceedings and other governmental investigations including patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, securities litigation, employment litigation, breach of contract claims, environmental, government and tax investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time as a party or as a non-party witness, with both private parties and certain government agencies. We may incur substantial time and expenses participating in these types of lawsuits and investigations, which could divert management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and operations. In addition, these matters and any other substantial litigation may result in verdicts against us or our affiliates or government enforcement actions, which may include significant monetary penalties, potentially preventing the approval, manufacture, marketing and sale of our product candidates. Any dispute resolved unfavorably could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results. ​ ​ ​ 53 Table of Contents Item 2.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021 (“Effective Time”), we consummated the business combination (“Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company which applies innovative science to known molecules to develop life-saving medicines through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company's foundation product, NRX-101 (D-cylcoserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). NRX-101 is covered by multiple U.S. and foreign patents, including a Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx Pharmaceuticals by Glytech, LLC. ​ Operations ​ The Company is engaged in the development of NRX-101, a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine, or DCS, and lurasidone for the treatment of suicidal bipolar depression and potentially for other future indications. In January 2023 the Company met with the FDA and was guided to expand its intended use of NRX-101 from the original population of patients with acute suicidality who might be treated in the hospital environment to the broader population of patients with subacute suicidal ideation (now described by the Company as Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression) who are treated in the outpatient setting. This broader population of patients are the current target population of the ongoing clinical trial. ​ Based on the guidance of the FDA and the Company’s completion of manufacturing for phase 3/commercial stage investigational product, the Company upgraded the ongoing clinical trial to a phase 2b/3 trial, the results of which have the potential to be used for registrational filings. The Company is engaged in that ongoing clinical trial of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression with the objective of demonstrating a decrease in depression scores and scores of suicidal ideation in patients treated with NRX-101 compared to those treated with lurasidone alone. ​ The clinical trial was originally begun as an exploratory study in Q2 2022. In Q1 2023 the study’s independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed both safety and unblinded efficacy data for the first 50 patients in the clinical trial and advised the Company that no safety concerns were identified. Moreover, the DSMB did not identify a futility signal, suggesting that the trial has potential to demonstrate a statistically significant outcome with additional enrollment. On this basis, the DSMB advised management to continue enrolling study participants. ​ During the first quarter of 2023, the Company refined its ability to validate the psychometric ratings that are used to assess the efficacy endpoints for the clinical trial. The Company relies upon a team of veteran raters who both train independent site raters and monitor the technical quality of each rating. A standard was set of 90 % or better congruence between the Company’s veteran rating team and site raters. This standard was met for all study participants whose ratings were obtained 8 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in their primary language and management believes that this standard can be maintained for the duration of the trial. The Company has recently released research findings that demonstrate better than 94 % congruence on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), which constitutes the primary efficacy endpoint. ​ In April 2023, the Company contracted with 1nHealth to initiate a recruitment campaign that may cover up to 45 states in the U.S. to recruit sufficient participants for this enlarged trial. The Company has similarly broadened its relationship with Science 37, a contract research organization that conducts decentralized clinical trials, to enroll participants identified by the 1nHealth recruitment initiative and randomize them to be treated within the broadened clinical trial. 1nHealth has additionally engaged “The Mighty,” a voice-of-the-patient organization with national reach to publicize the clinical trial to the 800,000+ subscribers who have indicated a focus on bipolar depression and suicidality. ​ In Q1 2023, the Company announced the participation of Prof. Andrew Nierenberg, M.D., Head of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Dauton Family Center for Bipolar Treatment Innovation as the Principal Investigator of the clinical trial. The Company has now initiated clinical trial sites at Northwestern University (Chicago) and University of Texas, Austin, in addition to commercial research sites. ​ The Company has completed manufacture of all clinical supplies required for its ongoing clinical trials. This initiative is expected to yield stability data sufficient to support a shelf life in excess of two years at time of potential drug launch (should the clinical trials be successful). The completion of this manufacturing milestone may allow the Company to decrease ongoing expenditure associated with manufacturing and development of chemical manufacturing controls. ​ On June 2, 2023, the Company entered into an Exclusive, Global - Development, Supply, Marketing & License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Alvogen Pharma US, Inc., Alvogen, Inc. and Lotus Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (collectively, “Alvogen”). Under the License Agreement, NRx granted Alvogen an exclusive (even as to NRx and its affiliates) worldwide, transferable and sublicensable license under certain intellectual property (including patents, know-how and trademarks) owned or controlled by NRx to develop (with certain limitations), manufacture, and commercialize NRX-101, for the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality. The term of the license is, on a country-by-country basis, 20 years from the first commercial sale of NRX-101 in such country, extendable by Alvogen for a two-year period upon its request made prior to the expiration of such 20-year period. During the term of the License Agreement, the parties have agreed (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) not to research, develop, seek or obtain any regulatory approval for the manufacturing, marketing, sale, or other commercialization of any product containing a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone in the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality, nor to authorize or assist (including by investing in or otherwise providing funding to) any third party to do so. During the term of the License Agreement, NRx is permitted to develop additional products containing D-cycloserine in combination with one or more other active antidepressant or antipsychotic ingredients for use outside of the field of treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality, such as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or chronic pain in depression, in which case, if NRx wishes to license rights to develop or commercialize such additional products or indications, Alvogen has a right of first negotiation to obtain such a license. ​ Progress on NRX-100 (ketamine) . During Q1 management met with the psychiatry division of the FDA to discuss paths to market for NRX-101 as monotherapy and as sequential therapy following stabilization with ketamine. The FDA indicated that treatment following ketamine would require data sufficient to file a New Drug Application for the use of ketamine as a stabilization agent. Currently, the FDA has limited data on file that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of ketamine. Accordingly, the Company has established a scientific collaboration with Prof. Marion Leboyer of Paris, France and Prof. Mocrane Abbar of Lyon, France in order to incorporate the results of a 160 -person inpatient trial of intravenous ketamine vs. placebo for the stabilization of patients admitted for acute suicidality. The findings of the trial demonstrate a statistically significant 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS reduction in both suicidality (the primary endpoint) and depression (the secondary endpoint) among patients treated with intravenous ketamine compared to those treated with placebo. ​ The Company has negotiated a data sharing agreement with the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire De Nîmes in France in order to permit deidentified patient level data to be transmitted by NRx to the FDA for regulatory purposes. The Company is of the belief that these multicenter, randomized prospective data, combined with randomized, prospective data on more than 200 US patients when submitted for review at a patient level will likely be sufficient to demonstrate preliminary safety and efficacy of intravenous ketamine in acutely suicidal patients. Data are expected to be transmitted to FDA by the end of Q3. ​ New Therapeutic Targets: ​ The Company is exploring three new therapeutic targets for NRX-101 and related drugs: treatment of Chronic Pain, treatment of PTSD, and treatment of urinary tract infection. ​ Treatment of Chronic Pain: ​ The rationale for treatment of chronic pain with DCS is outlined in a 2016 scientific paper published by Schnitzer, et. al. In brief, DCS as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) antagonist drug has demonstrated extensive nonclinical and early clinical efficacy in: (i) decreasing the response to nociceptive pain (i.e., pain triggered by pain receptors in the body) and (ii) decreasing craving for opioid drugs, with evidence that DCS is both nonaddictive and non-neurotoxic. In order to support its development of NRX-101 for treatment of chronic pain, the Company has licensed US Patent 8,653,120 from Apkarian Technologies and retained Prof. Apkar Vania Apkarian (the inventor) as a consultant to the Company. The Company believes that its ongoing composition of matter patents additionally apply to the use of NRX-101 in the treatment of chronic pain, as does its patent portfolio related to the treatment of fear memory with NRX-101. ​ The Company is awaiting results of a 200 -person randomized prospective trial funded by the US Department of Defense (NCT 03535688) in which patients with chronic pain were randomly assigned to DCS 400mg/day vs. placebo. These results are expected by year end 2023 and, if positive, are expected to provide a Breakthrough Therapy path towards treatment of chronic pain with DCS and DCS-containing medicines. In anticipation of these findings, the Company has established an Investigational New Drug (IND) file for NRX-101 in the treatment of Chronic Pain and submitted NRX-101 for review to the EPPICNET consortium of the National Institutes of Health. ​ Treatment of PTSD: ​ The Company has previously identified the rationale for treating Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with NMDA antagonist drugs. Based on the near-term data associated with the use of DCS in chronic pain and recent in-licensing of US8653120, management has elected to apply available resources to the chronic pain indication in the near term. ​ Treatment of Urinary Tract Infection and Urosepsis: ​ In recent years, increased antibiotic resistance to common pathogens that cause urinary tract infections and urosepsis (i.e., sepsis originating in the urinary tract) has resulted in a marked increase in hospitalization and death. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 1.7 million Americans contract sepsis each year, of whom at least 350,000 die during their hospitalization or are discharged to hospice. DCS is currently approved for the treatment of urinary tract infection and, as recently as 2015 was demonstrated to be effective against pathogens that are increasingly resistant to first- and second-line antibiotics. DCS is not widely used, however, because of its known propensity to cause hallucination at therapeutically effective doses. The Company believes that the combination of DCS with a 5-HT2A antagonist in NRX-101 has the potential to treat antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections with decreased propensity to 10 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS cause unwanted CNS effects. The Company has initiated pre-clinical research to evaluate whether current antibiotic-resistant pathogens are resistant to NRX-101 both in laboratory culture and simulated urine. ​ ​ 2. Liquidity As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $ 15.0 million in cash. Since inception, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. The Company believes that it has the funds necessary to support its operations through the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company’s ability to support its ongoing capital needs is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, in order to continue operations. On March 8, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “March Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase up to 3,866,666 shares of Common Stock (the “March Investor Warrants”) in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for a purchase price of $0.75 per share (the “March Offering”). The March Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share, are exercisable beginning on September 8, 2023 (the “March Initial Exercise Date”) and will expire 5 years from the March Initial Exercise Date. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the March Offering were approximately $2.9 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from such offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. On June 6, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors (the “June Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 9,670,002 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and warrants to purchase up to 9,670,002 shares of Common Stock (the “June Investor Warrants”). The Common Stock was issued in a registered direct offering for a purchase price of $0.65 per share (the “June Offering”) and the June Investor Warrants were offered pursuant to a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The June Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.6525 per share, are initially exercisable beginning six months following the date of issuance (the “June Initial Exercise Date”) and will expire 5 years from the June Initial Exercise Date. The aggregate net cash proceeds to the Company from the June Offering were approximately $5.71 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from such offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. ​ The Company’s ongoing clinical activities continue to generate losses and net cash outflows from operations. The Company plans to pursue additional equity or debt financing or refinancing opportunities in 2023 to fund ongoing clinical activities, to meet obligations under its current debt arrangements and for the general corporate purposes of the Company. Such arrangements may take the form of loans, equity offerings, strategic agreements, licensing agreements, joint ventures or other agreements. The sale of equity could result in additional dilution to the Company’s existing shareholders. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms, or that it will be able to refinance its existing debt obligations which could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to a reduction in the Company’s operations. We will continue to carefully monitor the impact of our continuing operations on our working capital needs and debt repayment obligations. As such, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company may raise substantial additional funds, and if it does so, it may do so through one or more of the following: issuance of additional debt or equity and/or the completion of a licensing or other commercial transaction for one of the Company’s product candidates. 11 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. ​ 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the convertible note payable, earnout cash liability, stock options, warrants, and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. 12 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 11) Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are occasionally invested in certificates of deposit. The Company maintains each of its cash balances with high-quality and accredited financial institutions and accordingly, such funds are not exposed to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. Deposits in financial institutions may, from time to time, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash. The Company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the form of a money market account with a financial institution that management believes to be creditworthy. Revenue Recognition Arrangements may include licenses to intellectual property, research services and participation on joint research committees. The Company evaluates the promised goods or services to determine which promises, or group of promises, represent performance obligations. In contemplation of whether a promised good or service meets the criteria required of a performance obligation, the Company considers the stage of research, the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities and expertise of the customer relative to the underlying intellectual property, and whether the promised goods or services are integral to or dependent on other promises in the contract. When accounting for an arrangement that contains multiple performance obligations, the Company must develop judgmental assumptions, which may include market conditions, timelines and probabilities of regulatory success to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. ​ The Company enters into contractual arrangements that may include licenses to intellectual property and research and development services. When such contractual arrangements are determined to be accounted for in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company evaluates the promised good or services to determine which promises, or group of promises, represent performance obligations. When accounting for an arrangement that contains multiple performance obligations, the Company must develop judgmental assumptions, which may include market conditions, timelines and probabilities of regulatory success to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. ​ The License Agreement with Alvogen as further discussed in Note 6 below is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods 13 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, it performs the following five steps: ​ i. identify the contract(s) with a customer; ii. identify the performance obligations in the contract; iii. determine the transaction price; iv. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations within the contract; and v. recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ​ The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it determines that it is probable it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. ​ At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within the contract to determine whether each promised good or service is a performance obligation. The promised goods or services in the Company’s arrangements typically consist of a license to intellectual property and research services. The Company may provide options to additional items in such arrangements, which are accounted for as separate contracts when the customer elects to exercise such options, unless the option provides a material right to the customer. Performance obligations are promises in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer that (i) the customer can benefit from on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Goods or services that are not individually distinct performance obligations are combined with other promised goods or services until such combined group of promises meet the requirements of a performance obligation. ​ The Company determines transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. Consideration may be fixed, variable, or a combination of both. At contract inception for arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company estimates the probability and extent of consideration it expects to receive under the contract utilizing either the most likely amount method or expected amount method, whichever best estimates the amount expected to be received. The Company then considers any constraints on the variable consideration and includes in the transaction price variable consideration to the extent it is deemed probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. ​ The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price and recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) control is transferred to the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied. For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. ​ The Company records amounts as accounts receivable when the right to consideration is deemed unconditional. When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded as deferred revenue. ​ The Company’s revenue arrangements include the following: ​ Milestone Payments: At the inception of an agreement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates each milestone to determine when and how much of the milestone to include in the transaction price. The Company first estimates the amount of the milestone payment that the Company could receive using either the expected value or the most 14 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS likely amount approach. The Company primarily uses the most likely amount approach as that approach is generally most predictive for milestone payments with a binary outcome. Then, the Company considers whether any portion of that estimated amount is subject to the variable consideration constraint (that is, whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty.) The Company updates the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price at each reporting date which includes updating the assessment of the likely amount of consideration and the application of the constraint to reflect current facts and circumstances. ​ Royalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). ​ Research Services: The Company is incurring research costs in association with the Alvogen agreement. After the First Milestone Payment (as defined in Note 6 below), the Company will be reimbursed for certain costs incurred related to reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs for clinical and non-clinical development activities. The Company will recognize revenue for the reimbursed costs when the First Milestone Payment contingencies have been achieved and the Company has an enforceable claim to the reimbursed costs. ​ See Note 6, “Alvogen Licensing Agreement”, for further information on the application of ASC 606 to the License Agreement. ​ Research and Development Costs ​ The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Convertible Note Payable ​ As permitted under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”), the Company elects to account for its convertible promissory note, which meets the required criteria, at fair value at inception and at each subsequent reporting date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of non-operating loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion of total changes in fair value of the convertible note attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk are determined through specific measurement of periodic changes in the discount rate assumption exclusive of base market changes and are presented as a component of comprehensive income in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As a result of electing the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible promissory notes are expensed as incurred. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to 15 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the time to expiration. Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. The Company estimates the fair value of restricted stock award grants using the closing trading price of the Company’s common stock on the date of issuance. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured at fair value and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below) was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants (as defined below) was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achieving earnout cash milestone and/or earnout shares milestone at each reporting period (see Notes 9 and 11). Modification of Warrants A change in any of the terms or conditions of warrants is accounted for as a modification. The accounting for incremental fair value of warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification which may result in a reduction of additional paid-in capital, recognition of costs for services rendered, or recognized as a deemed dividend. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future 16 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Loss Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, restricted stock awards and warrants were to vest and be exercised. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, convertible notes, and other dilutive instruments because their effect would be anti-dilutive in the periods in which the Company incurs a net loss. The following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share attributable to common stock for the periods in which a net loss is presented because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended June 30, ​ Six Months Ended June 30, ​ ​ 2023 2022 2023 2022 Stock options ​ 2,548,849 2,706,115 2,548,849 2,706,115 Restricted stock awards ​ 1,000,000 ​ — ​ 1,000,000 ​ — Common stock warrants ​ 30,021,591 17,521,753 30,021,591 17,521,753 Earnout Shares ​ — ​ 22,209,280 ​ — ​ 22,209,280 Earnout Shares from exercised Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants ​ — ​ 1,229,925 ​ — ​ 1,229,925 ​ Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.

Alvogen Licensing Agreement On June 2, 2023, the Company entered into the License Agreement with Alvogen. The Company and Alvogen are referred to below individually as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.” License Grant Under the License Agreement, the Company granted Alvogen an exclusive (even as to the Company and its affiliates) worldwide, transferable and sublicensable license under certain intellectual property (including patents, know-how and trademarks) owned or controlled by the Company to develop (with certain limitations), manufacture, and commercialize the Company’s candidate therapeutic product, NRX-101, for the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality. The term of the license is, on a country-by-country basis, 20 years from the first commercial sale of NRX-101 in such country, extendable by Alvogen for a two-year period upon its request made prior to the expiration of such 20-year period. During the term of the License Agreement, the Parties agree (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) not to research, develop, seek or obtain any regulatory approval for the manufacturing, marketing, sale, or other commercialization of any product containing a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone in the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality, nor to authorize or assist (including by investing in or otherwise providing funding to) any third party to do so. ​ During the term, the Company is permitted to develop additional products containing D-cycloserine in combination with one or more other active antidepressant or antipsychotic ingredients for use outside of the field of treatment of bipolar 18 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS depression with suicidality, such as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or chronic pain in depression, in which case, if the Company wishes to license rights to develop or commercialize such additional products or indications, Alvogen has a right of first negotiation to obtain such a license. Term and Termination The License Agreement will remain in force until the earlier to occur of (i) 20 years following the first commercial sale of NRX-101 on a country-by-country basis (which may be extended for a two-year period at Alvogen’s request), and (ii) the date that the agreement is terminated under its early termination provisions. Early termination grounds include, subject to applicable cure periods, a material breach of agreement by the other Party, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other Party, or a party’s reasonable belief that there is an unacceptable risk for harm in humans based upon preclinical safety data or the observation of serious adverse effects in humans. ​ In addition, Alvogen has the right to early termination if (i) the phase 2 study relating to NRX-101 is not completed and/or a successful read out from the study does not occur by March 31, 2024, or (ii) there is no completion of a Type B meeting with the FDA by March 31, 2024. Alvogen may also terminate upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the Company at any time after the First Milestone Payment (as defined below) has been made. The Company also has the right to terminate the License Agreement if the current phase 2 study successfully concludes prior to March 31, 2024 and the Type B meeting with the FDA is completed by March 31, 2024 and Alvogen does not notify the Company within 60 days that it wishes to proceed with the development of NRX-101 or has not paid the First Milestone Payment. ​ Upon expiration or termination of the License Agreement, the intellectual property rights licensed to Alvogen under the License Agreement will revert to the Company, and all other rights and obligations of each of the parties will immediately cease, except for ant outstanding amounts owed as of the time of such expiration or termination. Upon termination, Alvogen will grant to the Company an exclusive irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, transferrable license under the NDA rights to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, or commercialize the product in the field of bipolar depression with suicidality. Such reversion license would be granted by Alvogen to the Company in exchange for an equitable royalty payable by the Company to Alvogen that would be negotiated and agreed in good faith by the parties within 30 business days of such matter being presented to them. Milestone Payments In exchange for the license grant and the participation of the Company in the development, regulatory and commercial activities described below, Alvogen will pay the Company an initial $ 10 million cash payment upon the later of a positive data read-out from the Company’s ongoing Phase 2b/3 clinical trial and completion of the Type B meeting with the U.S. FDA (the “First Milestone Payment”). A second milestone payment of $ 5 million (the “Approval Payment”) is due upon Alvogen’s receipt of a copy of the FDA’s notice of NDA Approval for Product with the label indication for the treatment of bipolar depression with sub-acute or acute suicidality. Additional bonus milestone payments of increasing amounts up to $ 330 million will be payable upon the achievement of net sales targets measured over the trailing four quarters. Alvogen also will pay royalties (as described below) to the Company based on the net sales of NRX-101, with a reduction in royalties on a country-by-country basis upon expiration or termination of the Company’s patent protection on the NRX-101 composition. Royalties Subject to certain adjustments for sublicensing and other deductions, commencing on the first commercial sale of NRX-101, Alvogen has agreed to pay to the Company tiered royalties calculated on the basis of a percentage, ranging from the low to mid-teens, of annual net sales of NRX-101 measured over the trailing four quarters. In addition, if Alvogen sublicenses NRX-101 in any country other than the U.S. (in which the royalty rates described above will apply), Alvogen 19 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS will pay the Company a percentage of any and all consideration received by Alvogen or its affiliates from sublicensing any of the rights granted. Development and Regulatory Activities Prior to payment of the First Milestone Payment by Alvogen to the Company, each Party has agreed to perform, at its own cost, certain development activities using diligent efforts and in accordance with applicable then-current good manufacturing and other applicable practices, laws and regulations, with the goal of supporting the preparation and filing of an NDA and obtaining regulatory approval for NRX-101. Until the payment of the First Milestone Payment, the Company has the sole right to control and responsibility for all regulatory matters relating to NRX-101, at its sole cost and expense, and the Company shall own all regulatory materials and own all worldwide regulatory approvals for NRX-101. ​ After the payment of the First Milestone Payment, Alvogen has the sole right and responsibility, at its cost and expense, for all regulatory matters relating to NRX-101, and Alvogen will own all regulatory materials and all regulatory approvals for the product in the licensed territory (and the Company will assign all of its rights in any regulatory materials to Alvogen). Each party has committed to reasonably cooperate with the other in carrying out the development and regulatory activities outlined in the development plan. In addition, Alvogen has agreed to fund the next registrational study of NRX-101 in the field of treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality. ​ Upon NDA approval of the product in the U.S., Alvogen has agreed to use diligent efforts to commercialize NRX-101 in the U.S., and, for 24 months following such approval, in other countries in the territory upon regulatory approval in each such country. If Alvogen does not commercialize NRX-101 in a country outside of the U.S. in the foregoing 24-month period, then the license may revert back to the Company with respect to such country and the Company would pay Alvogen tiered royalties in the low to mid-teens based on net sales of NRX-101 in such country. The Parties will also enter into a pharmacovigilance agreement to ensure compliance with safety reporting requirements of all applicable regulatory agencies globally with respect to the commercialization of NRX-101. Commercial Activities Under the License Agreement, the Company is responsible for and will control the manufacturing of the NRX-101 commercial product and for qualification and regulatory-related activities necessary for the manufacture of the product. The Parties intend to enter into a clinical supply agreement (and a related quality agreement) on reasonable and customary terms, in which the Company will supply Alvogen raw materials and/or finished product without any markup to the future supply price from the Company’s current contract manufacturer. Similarly, prior to initiation of the first Phase 3 study for the commercial product, the Parties will enter into a commercial supply agreement (and a related quality agreement) on reasonable and customary terms, in which the Company will supply Alvogen raw materials and/or finished product without any markup to the future supply price from NRx’s current contract manufacturer. At any time after NDA approval, Alvogen may elect to manufacture, fill and package the product itself or through a third-party supplier subject to the prior approval of the Company. In such case, the parties may also work together to establish a written manufacturing technology transfer plan to transfer manufacturing technology from the Company or the Company’s contract manufacturer to Alvogen or Alvogen’s designated third party supplier. The Company has agreed, as a part of its manufacturing commitments, to make available its qualified technical personnel to consult with Alvogen to complete transfer of the manufacturing technology if required under the License Agreement. ​ Following NDA approval, Alvogen will control and be responsible for advertising, marketing, promotion and marketing, pricing, and terms of sale for the product, all at Alvogen’s sole expense. Alvogen has committed to not shift, allocate, price or discount sales of the product for the purpose of reducing or disadvantaging the net sales of the product in order to reduce the payments owed by Alvogen to the Company under the License Agreement. ​ 20 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of June 30, 2023, the Company has not achieved any milestones nor recognized any revenue associated with the License Agreement. 7. Debt Convertible Note On November 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (the “Lender”), and, pursuant to the SPA, issued to the Lender an unsecured promissory note with a face amount of approximately $ 11.0 million (the “Note”) before an original issue discount of $ 1.0 million, which was deducted from the proceeds of the Note. ​ The Note carries a 9% interest rate, has a term of 18 months from the issuance date (the “Maturity Date”) and is redeemable as described below. Any time after the issuance date, the Company has the right to prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the Note. If the Company exercises its right to prepay the Note, the Company will make payment to the Lender of an amount in cash equal to 110% multiplied by the portion of the outstanding balance the Company elects to pay. Beginning on May 4, 2023, the Lender has the right to redeem up to $1.0 million (“Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount”) of the outstanding balance of the Note per month. Payments may be made by the Company, at the Company’s option, (a) in cash with a 10% premium for the amount redeemed, (b) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of Common Stock with the number of redemption shares being equal to the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Conversion Price (as defined below) or (c) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. The “Redemption Conversion Price” is equal to 85% multiplied by the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average prices per share of the Common Stock during the 15 trading days immediately preceding the date that the Lender delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the Note. The Company’s right to satisfy the redemption amount in shares of Common Stock is subject to certain limitations, including (i) there not being any Equity Conditions Failure (as defined in the Note) and (ii) the Lender not owning more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. At any time, if the Company’s market capitalization is less than $25.0 million, the 4.99% ownership limitation shall be increased to 9.99%. On March 30, 2023, the Company amended the Note to increase the ownership limitation to 9.99%. If the Company elects to prepay the Note prior to the Maturity Date or elects to pay a portion or all of the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount in cash, it must pay a premium of 10%, subject to certain exceptions. The Company has the right to make the required payments for the Note in Common Stock subject to certain conditions including ownership and trading volume limitations. On July 7, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment #2 to the Convertible Promissory Note (the “Second Amendment”), with the Lender. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company and the Lender agreed to further amend the terms of the Note. In accordance with the Second Amendment, the Company and the Lender agreed to amend the redemption provisions of the Note. In particular, the Company agreed to pay the Lender an amount in cash equal to $1,800,000 on or before July 10, 2023, which amount was paid on July 10, 2023. In addition, on or before the last day of each month until December 31, 2023 (the “Minimum Payment Period”), the Company has agreed to pay the Lender an amount equal to $0.4 million in cash, less any redemption amount satisfied in Redemption Conversion Shares (as defined in Note 14 below) for such month (each, a “Minimum Payment”) The Lender also agreed to waive the application of the Trigger Effect (as defined in the Note) and any of the remedies set forth in Section 4 of the Note that may have occurred up to the date of the amendment. The Company will evaluate and disclose the accounting impacts of the amendment, including any trouble debt restructuring considerations, in filings subsequent to June 30, 2023. ​ Beginning May 1, 2023, in the event (a) the daily dollar trading volume of the Common Stock of the Company on any given trading day is at least fifty percent (50%) greater than the lower of (i) the median daily dollar trading volume over the previous ten trading days or (ii) the daily dollar trading volume on the trading day immediately preceding the date of 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS measurement or (b) if the closing trade price on any given trading day is at least thirty percent greater than the Nasdaq Minimum Price (as defined in the Note), then the Lender will be entitled to redeem over the following ten trading days an amount of indebtedness then outstanding under the Note equal to twice the monthly redemption amount of $1.0 million solely by payment by Common Stock, subject to maximum percentage and other ownership limitations under the SPA and the Note. ​ The Note contains certain Trigger Events (as defined in the Note) that generally, if uncured within five trading days, may result in an event of default in accordance with the terms of the Notes (such event, an “Event of Default”). Upon an Event of a Default, the Lender may consider the Note immediately due and payable. Upon an Event of Default, the interest rate may also be increased to the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. As of June 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the Note’s terms and there were no Events of Default. ​ Due to these embedded features within the Note, the Company elected to account for the Note at fair value at inception. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. The discount to the principal amount is included in the carrying value of the Note. During 2022, the Company recorded a debt discount of approximately $ 1.0 million upon issuance of the Note for the original issue discount of $ 1.0 million. As a result of electing the fair value option, any direct costs and fees related to the Note was expensed as incurred. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a change in fair value of approximately $ 0.7 and $ 2.4 million, respectively, related to the change in fair value of the Note which was recognized in other income (expense) on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Company’s election of the fair value option. ​ During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company made interest payments on the Note of approximately $0.1 million and issued shares of Common Stock as principal and interest repayments on the Note of $0.2 million. ​ 22 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Sponsored Research Agreement with National Jewish Health On February 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“Research Agreement”) with National Jewish Health (“NJ Health”), a Colorado not-for-profit institution. Under the terms of the Research Agreement, the Company agreed to sponsor a research study at NJ Health relating to the impact of the Company’s' former product candidate Aviptadil on propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in alveolar type II cells in vitro (the “Study”). In return for performance of the Study under the Research Agreement, the Company has committed to pay NJ Health approximately $ 0.4 million upon finalization of the work. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has fully paid NJ Health the total committed amount under this agreement. ​ Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Relief Therapeutics for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The Collaboration Agreement provides for funding by Relief Therapeutics of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the Collaboration Agreement. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics filed a lawsuit against the Company and its former CEO claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, which was followed by a counter claim from the Company for breach and repudiation of the Collaboration Agreement by Relief Therapeutics. On November 12, 2022, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG and Relief Therapeutics International (the “Relief Parties”) to settle the outstanding lawsuit with respect to the Collaboration Agreement. 23 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Under the APA, the Company transferred to the Relief Parties all of the Company’s interest in ZYESAMI (or the “Product” as such term is defined in the Collaboration Agreement), including intellectual property, FDA applications, clinical trial data, drug and API inventory and certain contractual rights. The Company has agreed to refrain from developing any product for any indication that uses or otherwise exploits the Product without the Relief Parties’ consent. The Relief Parties have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, market, and commercialize the Product, and have sole discretion to select the indications for which they will seek to develop the Product. Although the Company intends to monitor the progress of the Relief Parties under the APA and enforce the Company’s rights thereunder, there can be no assurances that the Relief Parties will be successful at commercializing the Product. Upon commercial launch of the Product by the Relief Parties or any of their affiliates, licensees or sublicensees (or upon authorization of use for any indication of the Product other than COVID-19), the Company is entitled to receive milestone payments in stages up to an aggregate amount of $ 13.0 million. The Relief Parties have also agreed to pay royalties to the Company on aggregate net sales of all Products, subject to a cap on royalty payments of $ 30.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, Relief is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue the Company’s existing Right to Try Program until December 2024. Mutual indemnity provisions in the APA will protect each party from any breaches of the settlement arrangements by the other party, provided, that the Company’s indemnity obligations will not start until the Relief Parties have begun making royalty or milestone payments to the Company, subject to certain exceptions. With respect to the Company, there is an indemnity threshold such that the Company will not be liable for any indemnity claims until such claims are in excess of $ 0.5 million (and then only for the amount above $ 0.5 million). The Company’s indemnity obligation is capped at $ 2.0 million with respect to breaches of representations and warranties and $ 3.0 million with respects to breaches of covenants or other agreements. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s indemnity obligations cannot exceed the amount that the Relief Parties actually pay to the Company for milestone and royalty payments. The parties closed the APA in December 2022 at which time all claims and counterclaims between the Company and the Relief Parties were dismissed with prejudice. Legal Proceedings From time to time the Company is involved in litigation, claims, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur. Share Subscription Facility Agreement - GEM NeuroRx entered into a share subscription facility agreement (the “GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term which expired in October 2022. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on a nationally recognized stock exchange, GEM granted NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares of NeuroRx for an aggregate value of up to approximately $95.6 million. The GEM Agreement also included certain provisions which did not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares thus preventing its usage. If shares of NeuroRx were listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange or NeuroRx completed a private transaction which resulted in a change of control, NeuroRx would have been obligated to issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the GEM Agreement. The Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement would not have resulted in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. 24 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue a warrant to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. The warrant was not conditional upon any further events or completion of the Merger. The warrant was issued on March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrant”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately partially exercise the GEM Warrant for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7.5 million. The GEM Warrant will be valid for a period of three years from the date NeuroRx’s stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or consummation of a reverse merger transaction of the type contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a contingent liability for its obligation to issue to GEM certain equity instruments at a discounted per share price. Specifically, as the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability and settlement expense of $ 39.5 million to reflect the fair value of the expected GEM Warrant to be issued. On March 28, 2021, when the GEM Warrant was issued, the Company recorded an additional charge of $ 21.4 million to reflect the increased fair value of the GEM Warrant on its grant date. Upon issuance, the GEM Warrant was equity classified and was determined to be within the scope of ASC 718, Share-Based Payments (“ASC 718”). The remaining unexercised 1,833,596 shares of NeuroRx common stock of the GEM Warrant became Substitute Warrants (as defined in Note 11 below). These Substitute Warrants were liability classified (see Note 11). The changes in fair value of these Substitute Warrants were recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of operations until these Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital. On August 12, 2022, the Company received a demand for arbitration (the “Demand”) from GEM. The Demand claimed that NeuroRx, failed to satisfy its obligation to pay GEM a commitment fee in the amount of HK$15,000,000 (approximately US$1,919,565 at current exchange rates) pursuant to the GEM Agreement. ​ On July 17, 2023, NeuroRx and GEM entered into a settlement and release agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties agreed to dismiss the arbitration proceeding with prejudice. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, on or before August 31, 2023, the Company will issue 678,676 shares of Common Stock to GEM. Such shares will be registered under a prospectus supplement to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 but will be subject to a restriction that they cannot be sold or traded for a period of six months from the effective date of the Settlement Agreement. ​ Other Legal Actions: ​ We are currently involved in and may from time to time become involved in various legal actions incidental to our business. As of the date of this report, we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, the outcome of any current or future legal proceeding is inherently difficult to predict and any dispute resolved unfavorably could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results. ​ ​ 25 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 9. Equity Common Stock Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. As discussed above in Note 2, on March 8, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals entered into a securities purchase agreement with the March Investors, providing for the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of Common Stock and the March Investor Warrants to purchase up to 3,866,666 shares of Common Stock in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for a purchase price of $0.75 per share. The March Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share, are exercisable beginning on September 8, 2023 and will expire 5 years from the March Initial Exercise Date. The March Investors agreed not to transfer the Common Stock for six months following the date of issuance. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the March Offering were approximately $2.9 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from such offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The closing of the sale of these securities occurred on March 9, 2023. The securities were issued pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on June 9, 2022 (File No. 333-265492) which became effective on June 21, 2022. ​ On February 8, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC. Although they did not act as the placement agent with respect to the March Offering, H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC was paid a cash fee equal to 3.0% of the amount raised, or approximately $0.1 million, pursuant to the letter agreement. ​ On June 6, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with the June Investors, providing for the issuance and sale of 9,670,002 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and the June Investor Warrants to purchase up to 9,670,002 shares of Common Stock. The Common Stock was issued in a registered direct offering for a purchase price of $0.65 per share and the June Investor Warrants were offered pursuant to a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The aggregate net cash proceeds to the Company from the June Offering were approximately $5.71 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the June Offering for the for working capital and general corporate purposes. ​ H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC acted as the exclusive placement agent (the “Placement Agent”) for the June 2023 Offering. The Placement Agent was paid a cash fee equal to 6.5 % of the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the securities at the closing of the June Offering or approximately $ 0.6 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from such offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. ​ ​ Preferred Stock ​ Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001 . The Company has no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Common Stock Warrants Substitute Warrants In connection with the Merger, each warrant to purchase shares of common stock of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted 26 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS into a warrant, based on the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ), that will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant (the “Substitute Warrants”). As these Substitute Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Substitute Warrants were recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Merger) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , with changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in the period of change. The Company recognized a loss and a gain on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the six months ended June 30, 2023 of less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.2 million, respectively. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had 3,450,000 Public Warrants outstanding (the “Public Warrants”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the Effective Time of the Merger and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon their redemption or liquidation of the Company. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 no Public Warrants were exercised. Assumed Private Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Private Placement Warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”). The Private Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Private Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2023. The Company measures the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s statements of operations for the current period. The Company recognized a loss and a gain on the change in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized a loss and a gain on the change in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 of less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of the fair value measurement of the Company’s warrant liabilities. Investor Warrants ​ As discussed above, on March 8, 2023, in conjunction with the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, the Company issued 3,866,666 March Investor Warrants which were classified in stockholder’s equity. The measurement of fair value of the March Investor Warrants were determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $0.72, exercise price of $0.75, term of five and a half years, volatility of 123.6%, risk-free rate of 4.34%, and expected dividend rate of 0%). The March Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share, are initially exercisable beginning six months following the March Initial Exercise Date and will expire five and a half years from the March Initial Exercise Date. The grant date fair value of these March Investor Warrants was estimated to be $2.4 million on March 8, 2023 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital. 27 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

The March Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share, are initially exercisable beginning six months following the March Initial Exercise Date and will expire five years from the March Initial Exercise Date. The grant date fair value of these March Investor Warrants was estimated to be $2.4 million on March 8, 2023 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital. The Company issued warrants to the Placement Agent with an exercise price of $0.81 (the “June Placement Agent Warrants”). As these June Placement Agent Warrants were issued for services provided in facilitating the June Offering, the Company recorded the fair value of such June Placement Agent Warrants of approximately $0.1 million as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $0.53, exercise price of $0.81, term of five and a half years, volatility of 175.1%, risk-free rate of 3.85%, and expected dividend rate of 0%). ​ In connection with the June Offering, the Company also entered into a warrant amendment agreement (the “Warrant Amendment Agreement”) with certain investors to amend certain existing warrants to purchase up to 9,622,778 shares of Common Stock that were previously issued in August 2021 and February 2022 to such investors, with an exercise price of $3.07 and $12.00 per share, respectively (the “Amended Warrants”) as follows: (i) lower the exercise price of the Amended Warrants to $0.6525 per share, and (ii) provide that the Amended Warrants, as amended, will not be exercisable until six months following the closing date of the June Offering, and (iii) extend the original expiration date of the Amended Warrants so that they will terminate five and one half years from the closing of the June Offering. ​ The Company recorded the incremental change in fair value of such Amended Warrants of $ 1.7 million as a cost of capital to issue the June Investor Warrants. The measurement of fair value for the Amended Warrants was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 0.53 , exercise price of $ 0.65 , term of five and a half years, volatility of 175.1 %, risk-free rate of 3.85 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). ​ The following table provides the activity for all warrants for the respective periods. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Weighted ​ Aggregate ​ ​ ​ Remaining ​ Average ​ Intrinsic Value ​ Total Warrants ​ Term ​ Exercise Price ​ (in thousands) Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 16,484,923 ​ 3.59 ​ $ 6.49 ​ ​ — Issued 3,866,666 ​ 4.69 ​ ​ 0.75 ​ ​ — Outstanding as of March 31, 2023 20,351,589 ​ 3.65 ​ ​ 5.40 ​ ​ — Issued 9,670,002 ​ 4.94 ​ ​ 0.65 ​ ​ — Outstanding as of June 30, 2023 30,021,591 ​ 4.36 ​ $ 2.51 ​ $ — ​ ​ ​ 28 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that were subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), based on the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ). Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 5.10 per share. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan As of June 30, 2023, 6,713,608 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the Company’s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of January 1, 2023, 664,430 shares were added to the 2021 Plan under an evergreen feature that automatically increases the reserve with additional shares of Common Stock for future issuance under the Incentive Plan each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) 1% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) a smaller number of shares determined by the Board. As of June 30, 2023, 5,749,394 shares have been awarded and 964,214 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and has limited company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the limited company-specific historical volatility and implied volatility as well as historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. The expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company did not grant any stock options during the three or six months ended June 30, 2023. 29 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of the Note was estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022. Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The estimated fair value of the money market account represents a Level 1 measurement. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and earnout cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements.

The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black Scholes options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical and peer company volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero -coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero. 32 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of June 30, 2023. 13. Related Party Transactions Glytech Agreement The Company licenses patents that are owned by Glytech, LLC (“Glytech”), pursuant to a license agreement (the “Glytech Agreement”). Glytech is owned by a co-founder and former director of the Company. The Glytech Agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition and plan of operations together with NRx Pharmaceuticals' unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (“BRPA”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals” or the “Company”). NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing, through its wholly owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx, NRX-100 and NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Bipolar Depression in patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) and Sub-Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (“SSIB”). NRX-100 and NRX-101 were developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Dr. Daniel Javitt, MD, PhD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRX-100 and NRX-101 investigational therapy begins with a single dose of ketamine (NRX-100), a Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for bipolar depression with ASIB and SSIB. NRX-101 combines d-Cycloserine, or DCS, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Biomarker Letter of Support, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline and stabilization in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS in combination with antidepressants. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a Phase 2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on data from the STABIL-B study (NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the active ingredient used in the market leading branded bipolar depression agent) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. In March 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals announced a primary focus on its psychiatry franchise and the late-stage development of NRX-101 for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality. NRX-101 is a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine, an NMDA antagonist, and lurasidone, a 5-HT 2A atypical antipsychotic and antidepressant, for the maintenance of remission from severe bipolar depression following initial stabilization with ketamine. The previously undiscovered synergy between these two drug classes in the treatment of CNS disorders, combined with the efficacy of D-cycloserine in the treatment of depression and PTSD, is the subject of 47 issued patents and more than 43 pending patents owned by or licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. ​ NRX-101 in Severe Bipolar Depression in Patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) After Initial Stabilization with ketamine ​ 37 Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NRX-101 Indication – Bipolar Depression in Patients with Sub-acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SSIB) ​ ​ Consolidated NRX-101 Program in Suicidal Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression 38 Table of Contents NRX-101 Indication – Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ​ ​ ​ Financial Results ​ Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has generated no revenues, has incurred operating losses since inception, expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Until such time as the Company is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of NRX-101 will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations. On March 8, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors (the “March Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase up to 3,866,666 shares of Common Stock (the “March Investor Warrants”) in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for a purchase price of $0.75 per share (the “March 42 Table of Contents Offering”). The March Investors have agreed not to transfer the Common Stock for six months following the date of issuance. The March Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share, are initially exercisable beginning six months following the date of issuance (the “March Initial Exercise Date”) and will expire 5 years from the March Initial Exercise Date. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the March Offering were approximately $2.9 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from such offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The closing of the sale of these securities occurred on March 9, 2023. On June 2, 2023, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Alvogen Pharma US, Inc., Alvogen, Inc. and Lotus Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (collectively, “Alvogen”). Under the License Agreement, NRx granted Alvogen an exclusive, worldwide, transferable and sublicensable license under certain intellectual property (including patents, know-how and trademarks) owned or controlled by NRx to develop (with certain limitations), manufacture, and commercialize NRX-101, for the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality. The term of the license is, on a country-by-country basis, 20 years from the first commercial sale of NRX-101 in such country, extendable by Alvogen for a two-year period upon its request made prior to the expiration of such 20-year period. During the term of the License Agreement, the parties have agreed (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) not to research, develop, seek or obtain any regulatory approval for the manufacturing, marketing, sale, or other commercialization of any product containing a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone in the treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality, nor to authorize or assist (including by investing in or otherwise providing funding to) any third party to do so. During the term of the License Agreement, NRx is permitted to develop additional products containing D-cycloserine in combination with one or more other active antidepressant or antipsychotic ingredients for use outside of the field of treatment of bipolar depression with suicidality, such as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or chronic pain in depression, in which case, if NRx wishes to license rights to develop or commercialize such additional products or indications, Alvogen has a right of first negotiation to obtain such a license. ​ Under the terms of the License Agreement, we have the right to an aggregate of up to $330 million in cash milestone payments, including an initial $10 million First Milestone Payment, upon the achievement of certain milestones. A second milestone payment of $5 million is due upon Alvogen’s receipt of a copy of the FDA’s notice of NDA Approval for Product with the label indication for the treatment of bipolar depression with sub-acute or acute suicidality. Additional cash milestone payments will become payable to us upon the achievement of net sales targets measured over the trailing four quarters. Alvogen has also agreed to pay the Company royalties based on the net sales of NRX-101. ​ On June 6, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors (the “June Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 9,670,002 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and warrants to purchase up to 9,670,002 shares of Common Stock (the “June Investor Warrants”). The Common Stock was issued in a registered direct offering for a purchase price of $0.65 per share (the “June Offering”) and the June Investor Warrants were offered pursuant to a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The June Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.6525 per share, are initially exercisable beginning six months following the date of issuance (the “June Initial Exercise Date”) and will expire five and one half years from the date of issuance. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company from the June Offering were approximately $6.28 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the June offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. ​ NRx Pharmaceuticals believes that it does not currently have sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through at least the next twelve months from the date of this quarterly report. NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operating. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively affect the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company's operations. 43 Table of Contents The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the periods shown below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance Sheet Data: ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ Cash ​ $ 14,969 ​ $ 20,054 Total assets ​ ​ 19,809 ​ ​ 25,816 Convertible note payable ​ ​ 12,692 ​ ​ 10,525 Total liabilities ​ ​ 22,617 ​ ​ 18,407 Total stockholders' (deficit) equity ​ ​ (2,808) ​ ​ 7,409 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, ​ ​ ​ 2023 ​ ​ 2022 ​ ​ ​ (Unaudited) Statement of Cash Flow Data: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net cash used in operating activities ​ ​ (13,901) ​ ​ (25,171) Net cash used in investing activities ​ (2) ​ (6) Net cash provided by financing activities ​ ​ 8,818 ​ ​ 22,120 Net (decrease) increase in cash ​ $ (5,085) ​ $ (3,057) ​ Operating activities During the six months ended June 30, 2023, operating activities used $13.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from a net loss of $19.8 million, reduced by (a) net non-cash losses of $3.9 million, including $2.4 million in change in fair value of convertible promissory note and $1.2 million of stock-based compensation, and (b) changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.9 million.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments See Note 7, Debt, and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended June 30 , 2023 included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the Company’s commitments and contingencies. Milestone Payments Pursuant to the legal settlement with Sarah Herzog Memorial Hospital Ezrat Nashim (“SHMH”) in September 2018, which included the license of intellectual property rights from SHMH, an ongoing royalty of 1% to 2.5% of NRX-101 gross sales is due to SHMH, together with milestone payments of $0.3 million, upon completion of phase 3 trials and commercial sale of NRX-101. The milestone payments for developmental and commercial milestones range from $0.1 million to $0.8 million. Annual maintenance fees are up to $0.2 million. 44 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. The Company has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates The Company's management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the earnout cash liability, stock-based compensation, and the valuation of warrants. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. Stock-based compensation We measure stock option awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value is the fair market value per share as of the grant date based on the closing trading price for the Company’s stock. The straight-line method of expense recognition is applied to awards with service-only conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock-based awards, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock-based awards, and our expected dividend yield. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded warrants on our common stock and historical volatility of a set of our publicly traded peer companies. We estimate the expected term of our options using the ""simplified"" method for awards that qualify as ""plain-vanilla"" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Warrant liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether 45 Table of Contents the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, or date of modification, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the earnout cash milestone and earnout shares milestone probabilities of achievement at each reporting period. Convertible note payable As permitted under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”), the Company elects to account for its convertible promissory note, which meets the required criteria, at fair value at inception and at each subsequent reporting date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of non-operating loss in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of electing the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible promissory notes are expensed as incurred. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the convertible note payable represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, the change in fair value of the convertible note payable recorded to other (income) expense could be materially different in the future. ​ 46 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation as of June 30 , 2023 under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who serves as our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30 , 2023 in providing reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ​ There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended June 30 , 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company’s systems evolve with its business. ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended June 30 , 2023 included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved. Item 1A. Risk Factors ​ We have disclosed the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on June 30, 2023 (the “Annual Report on Form 10-K”). There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or may not be able to assess, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. In addition to the risk factors detailed above, the following risk factors should also be considered: ​ 47 Table of Contents ​ Primarily as a result of our losses incurred to date, our expected continued future losses, and limited cash balances, we have included disclosure in our consolidated financial statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We do not have sufficient cash on hand and available liquidity to meet our obligations through the twelve months following the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. In the absence of financing, management anticipates that existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet operating and liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other factors, the sale of the shares of our Common Stock or obtaining alternate financing. Any failure or delay to secure such financing could force us to delay, limit or terminate our operations, make reductions in our workforce, liquidate all or a portion of our assets and/or seek protection under Chapters 7 or 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. ​ ​ Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Note to Streeterville Capital, LLC, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to issue securities during the term of the Note. Specifically, we agreed to obtain the Lender’s consent prior to issuing any debt securities or certain equity securities where the pricing of such equity securities is tied to the public trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, we also must offer the Lender the right to purchase up to 10% of future equity and debt securities offerings, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, during the term of the Note. ​ Further, we have agreed to make certain monthly redemption payments at the request of the Lender. Our failure to pay such redemptions, when due, may result in defaults under our agreements with the Lender. If we are in default with respect to our obligations under the Note, the Lender may consider the Note immediately due and payable and may elect to substantially increase the interest rate of the Note. We may not have the required funds to pay the required note redemptions and such redemptions, or penalties in connection therewith, may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, and ability to pay our other debts as they come due. ​ ​ Our common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. including the requirement that our Common Stock maintain an average minimum bid price of $1.00. In the past, we have received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq for failing to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00, but we have since regained compliance. On July 20, 2023, we received a written notification (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) – Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS”) because we had not maintained a minimum MVLS of $50,000,000 for the previous 33 consecutive business days. We have been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until January 22, 2024, to regain compliance with the MVLS requirement. To regain compliance, our MVLS must meet or exceed $50,000,000 for a minimum period of ten consecutive business days prior to January 22, 2024. If we are deficient in regaining compliance with and otherwise maintaining the necessary listing requirements, our Common Stock may be delisted. If our Common Stock is delisted, an active trading market for our Common Stock may not be sustained and the market price of our Common Stock could decline. Delisting of our Common Stock could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our Common Stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. 48 Table of Contents ​ ​ We are currently involved in, and in the future may become involved in, legal proceedings and other governmental investigations including patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, securities litigation, employment litigation, breach of contract claims, environmental, government and tax investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time as a party or as a non-party witness, with both private parties and certain government agencies. We may incur substantial time and expenses participating in these types of lawsuits and investigations, which could divert management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and operations. In addition, these matters and any other substantial litigation may result in verdicts against us or our affiliates or government enforcement actions, which may include significant monetary penalties, potentially preventing the approval, manufacture, marketing and sale of our product candidates. Any dispute resolved unfavorably could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results. ​ ​ ​ 49 Table of Contents Item 2.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021 (“Effective Time”), we consummated the business combination (“Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company which applies innovative science to known molecules to develop life-saving medicines through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company's foundation product, NRX-101 (D-cylcoserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). NRX-101 is covered by multiple U.S. and foreign patents, including a Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx Pharmaceuticals by Glytech, LLC. ​ Operations ​ The Company is engaged in the development of NRX-101, a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone for the treatment of suicidal bipolar depression and potentially for other future indications. NRX-101 has been granted Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In January 2023 the Company met with the FDA and was guided to expand its intended use of NRX-101 from the original population of patients with acute suicidality who might be treated in the hospital environment to the broader population of patients with subacute suicidal ideation (now described by the Company as Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression) who are treated in the outpatient setting. This broader population of patients are the current target population of the ongoing clinical trial. ​ Based on the guidance of FDA and the Company’s completion of manufacturing for phase 3/commercial stage investigational product, the Company upgraded the ongoing clinical trial to a phase 2b/3 trial, the results of which have the potential to be used for registrational filings. The Company is engaged in that ongoing clinical trial of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression with the objective of demonstrating a decreased in depression scores and scores of suicidal ideation in patients treated with NRX-101 compared to those treated with lurasidone alone. ​ The clinical trial was originally begun as an exploratory study in Q2 2022. In Q1 2023 the study’s independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed both safety and unblinded efficacy data for the first 50 patients in the clinical trial and advised the Company that no safety concerns were identified. Moreover, the DSMB did not identify a futility signal, suggesting that the trial has potential to demonstrate a statistically significant outcome with additional enrollment. On this basis, the DSMB advised management to continue enrolling study participants. ​ During the first quarter of 2023, the Company refined its ability to validate the psychometric ratings that are used to assess the efficacy endpoints for the clinical trial. The Company relies upon a team of veteran raters who both train independent 8 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS site rates and monitor the technical quality of each rating. A standard was set of 90% or better concordance between the Company’s veteran rating team and site raters. This standard was met for all study participants whose ratings were obtained in their primary language and management believes that this standard can be maintained for the duration of the trial. ​ In April 2023, the Company contracted with 1nHealth to initiate a recruitment campaign that may cover up to 45 states in the US to recruit sufficient participants for this enlarged trial. The Company has similarly broadened its relationship with Science 37, a contract research organization that conducts decentralized clinical trials, to enroll participants identified by the 1nHealth recruitment initiative and randomize them to be treated within the broadened clinical trial. 1nHealth has additionally engaged “The Mighty,” a voice-of-the-patient organization with national reach to publicize the clinical trial to the 800,000+ subscribers who have indicated a focus on bipolar depression and suicidality. ​ In Q1 2023, the Company announced the participation of Prof. Andrew Nierenberg, M.D., Head of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Dauton Family Center for Bipolar Treatment Innovation as the Principal Investigator of the clinical trial. The Company has now initiated clinical trial sites at Northwestern University (Chicago) and University of Texas, Austin, in addition to commercial research sites. ​ The Company has continued to engage in a strategic conversation focused on funding the drug approval and commercialization. In parallel, the Company has established an ongoing dialogue with Streeterville Capital LLC, the Company’s current debt lender, to configure the Company’s current debt facility to best support the ongoing needs of the clinical trial. ​ The Company has now completed manufacture of all clinical supplies required for its ongoing clinical trials. This initiative is expected to yield stability data sufficient to support a shelf life in excess of two years at time of potential drug launch (should the clinical trials be successful). The completion of this manufacturing milestone may allow the Company to decrease ongoing expenditure associated with manufacturing and development of chemical manufacturing controls. ​ ​ 2. Liquidity As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $ 16.5 million in cash. Since inception, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. The Company believes that it has the funds necessary to support its ongoing clinical trial, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company’s ability to support its ongoing capital needs is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. The Company is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. On March 8, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with accredited investors (the “Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase up to 3,866,666 shares of Common Stock (the “Investor Warrants”) in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for a purchase price of $ 0.75 per share (the “Offering”). The Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share, are exercisable beginning on September 8, 2023 (the “Initial Exercise Date”) and will expire 5 years from the Initial Exercise Date. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $2.9 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from such offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The closing of the sale of these securities occurred on March 9, 2023. 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company’s ongoing clinical activities continue to generate losses and net cash outflows from operations. The Company plans to pursue additional equity or debt financing or refinancing opportunities in 2023 to fund ongoing clinical activities, to meet obligations under its current debt arrangements and for the general corporate purposes of the Company. Such arrangements may take the form of loans, equity offerings, strategic agreements, licensing agreements, joint ventures or other agreements. The sale of equity could result in additional dilution to the Company’s existing shareholders. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms, or that it will be able to refinance its existing debt obligations which could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to a reduction in the Company’s operations. We will continue to carefully monitor the impact of our continuing operations on our working capital needs and debt repayment obligations. As such, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company may raise substantial additional funds, and if it does so, it may do so through one or more of the following: issuance of additional debt or equity and/or the completion of a licensing or other commercial transaction for one of the Company’s product candidates. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. ​ 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the convertible note payable, Earnout Cash liability, stock options, warrants, and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. 10 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 10) Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are occasionally invested in certificates of deposit. The Company maintains each of its cash balances with high-quality and accredited financial institutions and accordingly, such funds are not exposed to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. Deposits in financial institutions may, from time to time, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash. The Company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the form of a money market account with a financial institution that management believes to be creditworthy. Research and Development Costs ​ The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. 11 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Convertible Note Payable ​ As permitted under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”), the Company elects to account for its convertible promissory note, which meets the required criteria, at fair value at inception and at each subsequent reporting date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of non-operating loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion of total changes in fair value of the convertible note attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk are determined through specific measurement of periodic changes in the discount rate assumption exclusive of base market changes and are presented as a component of comprehensive income in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As a result of electing the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible promissory notes are expensed as incurred. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all 12 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured at fair value and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achieving Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period (see Notes 8 and 10). Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Loss Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, restricted stock awards and warrants were to vest and be exercised. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, convertible notes, and other dilutive instruments because their effect would be anti-dilutive in the periods in which the Company incurs a net loss. The following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share attributable to common stock for the periods in which a net loss is presented because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31, ​ 2023 2022 Stock options 2,548,849 2,906,948 Restricted stock awards ​ 1,000,000 ​ — Common stock warrants 20,351,589 17,521,753 Earnout Shares ​ — ​ 22,209,280 Earnout Shares from exercised Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants ​ — ​ 1,229,925 ​ 13 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Debt Convertible Note On November 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“Lender”), and, pursuant to the SPA, issued to the Lender an unsecured promissory note with a face amount of approximately $ 11.0 million (the “Note”) before an original issue discount of $1.0 million, which was deducted from the proceeds of the Note. ​ The Note carries a 9% interest rate, has a term of 18 months from the issuance date (the “Maturity Date”) and is redeemable as described below. Any time after the issuance date, the Company has the right to prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the Note. If the Company exercises its right to prepay the Note, the Company will make payment 14 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS to the Lender of an amount in cash equal to 110% multiplied by the portion of the outstanding balance the Company elects to pay. Beginning on May 4, 2023, the Lender has the right to redeem up to $1.0 million (“Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount”) of the outstanding balance of such Note per month. Payments may be made by the Company, at the Company’s option, (a) in cash with a 10% premium for the amount redeemed, (b) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of Common Stock with the number of redemption shares being equal to the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Conversion Price or (c) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. The “Redemption Conversion Price” shall equal 85% multiplied by the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average prices per share of the Common Stock during the 15 trading days immediately preceding the date that the Lender delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the Note. The Company’s right to satisfy the redemption amount in shares of Common Stock is subject to certain limitations, including (i) there not being any Equity Conditions Failure (as defined in the Note) and (ii) the Lender not owning more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. At any time, if market capitalization is less than $25.0 million, the 4.99% ownership limitation shall be increased to 9.99%. On March 30, 2023, the Company amended the Note to increase the ownership limitation to 9.99%. If the Company elects to prepay the Note prior to the Maturity Date or elects to pay a portion or all of the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount in cash, it must pay a premium of 10%, subject to certain exceptions. The Company has the right to make the required payments for the above Note in common stock subject to certain conditions including ownership and trading volume limitations. If the Company is not able to make the required payments for the above Note in common stock and must use cash for these payments, management believes that the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to support operations. Beginning May 1, 2023, in the event (a) the daily dollar trading volume of the Common Stock of the Company on any given trading day is at least fifty percent (50%) greater than the lower of (i) the median daily dollar trading volume over the previous ten (10) trading days or (ii) the daily dollar trading volume on the trading day immediately preceding the date of measurement or (b) if the closing trade price on any given trading day is at least thirty percent (30%) greater than the Nasdaq Minimum Price (as defined in the Note), then the Lender will be entitled to redeem over the following ten (10) trading days an amount of indebtedness then outstanding under the Note equal to twice (2x) the monthly redemption amount of $1.0 million solely by payment by Common Stock, subject to maximum percentage (9.99%) and other ownership limitations under the SPA and the Note. The Note contains certain Trigger Events (as defined in the Note) that generally, if uncured within five (5) trading days, may result in an event of default in accordance with the terms of the Notes (such event, an “Event of Default”). Upon an Event of a Default, the Lender may consider the Note immediately due and payable. Upon an Event of Default, the interest rate may also be increased to the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. As of March 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the Note terms and there were no Events of Default. ​ Due to these embedded features within the Note, the Company elected to account for the Note at fair value at inception. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to 15 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. The discount to the principal amount is included in the carrying value of the Note. During 2022, the Company recorded a debt discount of approximately $1.0 million upon issuance of the Note for the original issue discount of $1.0 million. As a result of electing the fair value option, any direct costs and fees related to the Note was expensed as incurred. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded a change in fair value of approximately $1.8 million related to the change in fair value of the Note which was recognized in other income (expense) on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Company’s election of the fair value option. ​ The following table presents the Note as of March 31, 2023 (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, 2023 ​ December 31, 2022 ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ Par value of the Note ​ $ 11,020 ​ $ 11,020 Debt discount ​ ​ ( 497 ) ​ ​ ( 1,000 ) Carrying value of the Note before current period change in fair value ​ ​ 10,523 ​ ​ 10,020 Fair value adjustment through earnings ​ ​ 1,772 ​ ​ 505 Fair value adjustment through accumulated other comprehensive income ​ ​ (106) ​ ​ — Total carrying value of Note ​ $ 12,189 ​ $ 10,525 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Convertible note payable - current portion ​ $ 12,189 ​ $ 7,703 Convertible note payable, net of current portion ​ $ — ​ $ 2,822 ​ ​ ​ ​ 7.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Relief Therapeutics for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The Collaboration Agreement provides for funding by Relief Therapeutics of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the Collaboration Agreement. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics filed a lawsuit against the Company and its former CEO claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, which was followed by a counter claim from the Company for breach and repudiation of the Collaboration Agreement by Relief Therapeutics. On November 12, 2022, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG and Relief Therapeutics International (the “Relief Parties”) to settle the outstanding lawsuit with respect to the Collaboration Agreement. Under the APA, the Company transferred to the Relief Parties all of the Company’s interest in ZYESAMI (or the “Product” as such term is defined in the Collaboration Agreement), including intellectual property, FDA applications, clinical trial data, drug and API inventory and certain contractual rights. The Company has agreed to refrain from developing any product for any indication that uses or otherwise exploits the Product without the Relief Parties’ consent. The Relief Parties have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, market, and commercialize the Product, but has sole discretion to select the indications for which it will seek to develop the Product. Although the Company intends to monitor the progress of the Relief Parties under the APA and enforce the Company’s rights thereunder, there can be no assurances that the Relief Parties will be successful at commercializing the Product. Upon commercial launch of the Product by the Relief Parties or any of their affiliates, licensees or sublicensees (or upon authorization of use for any indication of the Product other than COVID-19), the Company is entitled to receive milestone payments in stages up to an aggregate amount of $13.0 million. The Relief Parties have also agreed to pay royalties to the Company on aggregate net sales of all Products, subject to a cap on royalty payments of $30.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, Relief is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue the Company’s existing Right to Try Program for at least two (2) years after the closing of the APA. Mutual indemnity provisions in the APA will protect each party from any breaches of the settlement arrangements by the other party, provided, that the Company’s indemnity obligations will not start until the Relief Parties have begun making royalty or milestone payments to the Company, subject to certain exceptions. With respect to the Company, there is an indemnity threshold such that the Company will not be liable for any indemnity claims until such claims are in excess of $0.5 million (and then only for the amount above $0.5 million). The Company’s indemnity obligation is capped at $2.0 million with respect to breaches of representations and warranties and $3.0 million with respects to breaches of covenants or other agreements. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s indemnity obligations cannot exceed the amount that the Relief Parties actually pay to the Company for milestone and royalty payments. The parties have 30 days to implement the agreed actions and achieve closing under the APA, at which time all claims and counterclaims between the Company and the Relief Parties will be dismissed with prejudice. Legal Proceedings From time to time the Company is involved in litigation, claims, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur. 17 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Share Subscription Facility Agreement - GEM NeuroRx entered into a share subscription facility agreement (“GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term which expired in October 2022. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on an Exchange (any nationally recognized stock exchange or exchange platform in the world on which the Company will list its shares), GEM granted NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares from the Company for up to an aggregate value of approximately $95.6 million. The agreement also included certain provisions which would not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares thus preventing its usage. If NeuroRx was listed or completed a private transaction which results in a change of control of the Company, NeuroRx would issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the agreement. The Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement would not have resulted in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue a warrant to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. The warrant was not conditional upon any further events or completion of the Merger. The warrant was issued March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrant”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately partially exercise the warrant for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7.5 million. The GEM Warrant will be valid for a period of three years from the date NeuroRx’s stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or consummation of a reverse merger transaction of the type contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a contingent liability for its obligation to issue to GEM certain equity instruments at a discounted per share price. Specifically, as the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability and settlement expense of $ 39.5 million to reflect the fair value of the expected GEM Warrant to be issued. On March 28, 2021, when the GEM Warrant was issued, the Company recorded an additional charge of $ 21.4 million to reflect the increased fair value of the GEM Warrant on its grant date. Upon issuance, the GEM Warrant was equity classified and was determined to be within the scope of ASC 718, Share-Based Payments (“ASC 718”). The GEM Warrants that were not exercised as of the Merger were modified and became Substitute Warrants on 1,833,596 shares, adjusted for the Merger as discussed in Note 11). These Substitute Warrants were liability classified (see Note 9). The changes in fair value of these Substitute Warrants were recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of operations until these Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital. On August 12, 2022, the Company received a demand for arbitration (the “Demand”) from GEM. The Demand claims that the Company’s subsidiary, NeuroRx, failed to satisfy its obligation to pay GEM a commitment fee in the amount of HK$ 15.0 million (approximately $ 1.9 million at current exchange rates) pursuant to the GEM Agreement. NeuroRx expects to vigorously defend its position that payment of the commitment fee is neither due nor owing under the terms of the Agreement. 18 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Equity Common Stock Pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $ 0.001 . On March 8, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors (the “Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase up to 3,866,666 shares of Common Stock (the “Investor Warrants”) in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for a purchase price of $0.75 per share (the “Offering”). The Investors have agreed not to transfer the Common Stock for six months following the date hereof. The Investor Warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share, are initially exercisable beginning six months following the date of issuance (the “Initial Exercise Date”) and expire 5 years from the Initial Exercise Date. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering were $2.9 million. The closing of the sale of these securities occurred on March 9, 2023. The securities are being issued pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on June 9, 2022 (File No. 333-265492) and became effective on June 21, 2022. The net proceeds after deducting debt issuance costs from this transaction were $2.5 million. ​ On February 8, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC. Although they are not acting as the placement agent with respect to this offering, they are to be paid a cash fee equal to 3.0% of the amount raised, or approximately $ 0.1 million, in this offering pursuant to such agreement. ​ The Company sold 7,824,727 shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2022, generating net proceeds of $ 23.0 million. Preferred Stock Pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001 . The Company has no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Common Stock Warrants Substitute Warrants In connection with the Merger, each warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into a warrant, based on the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ), that will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant (the Substitute Warrants). As these Substitute Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Substitute Warrants were recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Merger) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , with changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in the period of change. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, of less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. 19 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had 3,450,000 Public Warrants outstanding. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the Effective Time of the Merger and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon their redemption or liquidation of the Company. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 no Public Warrants were exercised. Assumed Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Placement Warrants (the “Placement Warrants”). The Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2023. The Company measures the fair value of the Placement Warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s statements of operations for the current period. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 of less than $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. Investor Warrants ​ On March 8, 2023 the Company issued 3,866,666 Warrants which were classified in stockholder’s equity. The measurement of fair value of the Warrants were determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $0.72, exercise price of $0.75, term of five years, volatility of 123.6%, risk-free rate of 4.34%, and expected dividend rate of 0%). The grant date fair value of these Warrants was estimated to be $2.4 million on March 8, 2023 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of March 31, 2023.

Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that were subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), based on the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ). Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 5.10 per share. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan As of March 31, 2023, 6,713,608 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan. As of January 1, 2023, 664,430 shares were added to the 2021 Plan under an evergreen feature that automatically increases the reserve with additional shares of Common Stock for future issuance under the Incentive Plan each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) 1 % of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) a smaller number of shares determined by the Board. As of March 31, 2023, 5,749,394 shares have been awarded and 964,214 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and has limited company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the limited company-specific historical volatility and implied volatility as well as historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. The expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company did not grant any stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of the convertible note payable was estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022. Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.

The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black Scholes options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical and peer company volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero. 24 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Glytech is owned by a co-founder and former director of the Company. The Glytech Agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid Glytech $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively, for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. These support services are ongoing. The Fourth Amendment to the Glytech Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2020, includes an equity value-triggered transfer of Excluded Technology from Glytech to NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Excluded Technology is defined in the Glytech Agreement as any technology, and any know-how related thereto, covered in the licensed patents that do not recite either D-cycloserine or lurasidone individually or jointly. This definition would cover pharmaceutical formulations, including some that NRx Pharmaceuticals considers “pipeline” or “future product” opportunities, that contain a combination of pharmaceutical components different from those contained in NRX-100 and NRX-101. On November 6, 2022 the Glytech Agreement was amended whereby Glytech agreed to transfer and assign the remainder of the Licensed Technology and the Excluded Technology to NRx Pharmaceuticals for no additional consideration at any time upon receipt of written notice from the Company if, on or prior to January 31, 2023, (i) the value of the Glytech equity holdings in NRx 25 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Pharmaceuticals (the “Glytech Equity”) has an aggregate liquidity value of at least $50 million for twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding any given date and (ii) there are no legal or contractual restrictions on selling all of the securities represented by the Glytech Equity then applicable to Glytech (or reasonably foreseeable to be applicable to Glytech within the following twenty trading days). The Glytech Agreement was amended to extend the period to meet these conditions until May 15, 2023. The Company and Glytech may seek to extend this period beyond May 15, 2023 if additional time is needed to consummate a transaction. The Chief Scientist of the Company, Dr. Jonathan Javitt, is a major shareholder in the Company and a member of the Board of Directors. Therefore, his services are deemed to be a related party transaction. He served the Company on a full-time basis as CEO under an employment agreement with the Company until March 8, 2022 and currently serves under a Consulting Agreement with the Company as Chief Scientist thereafter and received compensation of $0.3 million and $ 0.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On March 29, 2023, the Consulting Agreement dated March 8, 2022 (the “Javitt Consulting Agreement”) between the Company and Dr. Jonathan Javitt was amended to extend the term of the Agreement until March 8, 2024 with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless one party or the other provides notice of non-renewal. The amendment also provided for payment at the rate of $0.6 million per year, payable monthly (i.e., less than $0.1 million per month), and a performance-based annual bonus with a minimum target of $0.3 million, at the discretion of the Board and upon satisfactory performance of the services. The annual bonus for 2023, if any, is payable in March 2024, will be pro-rated from the start of the extension period and is subject to Dr. Javitt’s continued engagement by the Company. The amendment also provides, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors, for a grant of 500,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company under the Company’s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The restrictions are performance based, and half of the restricted shares (250,000) shall have the restrictions removed on the New Drug Application Date (as defined below) and the remaining half (250,000) will have the restrictions removed on the New Drug Approval Date (as defined below). As of March 31, 2023, the Board of Directors have not approved the grant of restricted stock. The term “New Drug Application Date” means the date upon which the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) files the Company’s new drug application for the Antidepressant Drug Regimen (as defined below) for review. The term “New Drug Approval Date” means date upon which the FDA has both approved the Company’s Antidepressant Drug Regimen and listed the Company’s Antidepressant Drug Regimen in the FDA’s “Orange Book”. The term “Antidepressant Drug Regimen” means NRX-101, a proprietary fixed-dose combination capsule of d-cycloserine and Lurasidone, administered for sequential weeks of daily oral treatment following patient stabilization using a single infusion of NRX-100 (ketamine) or another standard of care therapy. Zachary Javitt is the son of Dr. Jonathan Javitt. Zachary Javitt provides services related to website, IT, and marketing support under the supervision of the Company’s CEO and the Company’s Senior Director of Global Communications, who are responsible for assuring that the services are provided on financial terms that are at market. The Company paid this family member a total of less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These services are ongoing. In addition, the Company paid PillTracker for digital health product development required to track the use of Aviptadil in clinical trials. Zachary Javitt and Jonathan Javitt are the chief executive officer and board chairman, respectively, of PillTracker. PillTracker agreements and transactions are submitted to the General Counsel of the Company and the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Related Person Transactions Policy. The Master Service Agreement dated April 1, 2020 (“MSA”), and all work orders thereunder, have been suspended by mutual agreement pending the Company’s re-evaluation of its respiratory franchise. NRx Pharmaceuticals paid PillTracker $ 0.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. 26 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Subsequent Events ​ The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. There have been no subsequent events that occurred during such period that would require disclosure in this Form 10-Q or would be required to be recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2023. ​ ​ ​ 27 Table of Contents ​ Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition and plan of operations together with NRx Pharmaceuticals' unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (“BRPA”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals” or the “Company”). NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing, through its wholly owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx, NRX-100 and NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Bipolar Depression in patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) and Sub-Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (“SSIB”). NRX-100 and NRX-101 were developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Dr. Daniel Javitt, MD, PhD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRX-100 and NRX-101 investigational therapy begins with a single dose of ketamine (NRX-100), a Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for bipolar depression with ASIB and SSIB. NRX-101 combines d-Cycloserine, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Biomarker Letter of Support, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline and stabilization in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS in combination with antidepressants. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a Phase 2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on data from the STABIL-B study (NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the active ingredient used in the market leading branded bipolar depression agent) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. In March 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals announced a primary focus on its psychiatry franchise and the late-stage development of NRX-101 for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality. NRX-101 is a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine, an NMDA antagonist, and lurasidone, a 5-HT 2A atypical antipsychotic and antidepressant, for the maintenance of remission from severe bipolar depression following initial stabilization with ketamine. The previously undiscovered synergy between these two drug classes in the treatment of CNS disorders, combined with the efficacy of D-cycloserine in the treatment of depression and PTSD, is the subject of 47 issued patents and more than 43 pending patents owned by or licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. ​ 28 Table of Contents NRX-101 in Severe Bipolar Depression in Patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) After Initial Stabilization with ketamine ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NRX-101 Indication – Bipolar Depression in Patients with Sub-acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SSIB) ​ 29 Table of Contents ​ Consolidated NRX-101 Program in Suicidal Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression Based on the comments and guidance from the FDA in its recent Type B meeting regarding the registrational Acute Suicidality trial and a potentially broader indication, as well as the guidance it received from the DSMB regarding the ongoing Phase IIb/3 clinical study of NRX-101 for the treatment of severe bipolar depression in patients with SSIB, the Company is evaluating changes to its registrational program for NRX-101 and will seek to consolidate patients originally expected to enroll in the ASIB study into the currently enrolling Phase IIb/3 trial. This would potentially allow registration of NRX-101 for Suicidal Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression, regardless of the mechanism of stabilization. With the FDA’s guidance to enroll patients for the acute (SPA) study in the outpatient setting only after stabilization, the design of this trial has effectively converged with the currently enrolling phase IIb/3 trial; patients within both groups are deemed to have treatment resistant bipolar depression with suicidality. This broader indication may also offer significant advantages in commercialization, while negating the need for a separate NDA for ketamine in Suicidal stabilization. NRX-101 Indication – Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ​ ​ ​ ​ Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $11.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals had an accumulated deficit of $234.0 million. ​ Components of Results of Operations Operating expenses Research and development expenses NRx Pharmaceuticals’ research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with NRx Pharmaceuticals’ clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and equity-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation, consultant fees, and professional fees for legal and accounting services. 30 Table of Contents Results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 ​ The following table sets forth NRx Pharmaceuticals’ selected statements of operations data for the following periods (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31, ​ Change ​ 2023 2022 Dollars ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ Operating expenses: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Research and development ​ $ 3,650 ​ $ 5,483 ​ $ (1,833) General and administrative ​ 5,785 ​ 10,222 ​ ​ (4,437) Total operating expenses ​ 9,435 ​ 15,705 ​ ​ (6,270) Loss from operations ​ $ (9,435) ​ $ (15,705) ​ $ 6,270 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other (income) expenses: ​ ​ ​ Interest income ​ $ (156) ​ $ — ​ $ (156) Interest expense ​ — ​ 3 ​ ​ (3) Change in fair value of convertible note payable ​ ​ 1,772 ​ — ​ ​ 1,772 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities ​ ​ (12) ​ ​ (157) ​ ​ 145 Change in fair value of Earnout Cash liability ​ ​ — ​ ​ (2,103) ​ ​ 2,103 Total other (income) expenses ​ 1,604 ​ (2,257) ​ ​ 3,861 Net loss ​ $ (11,039) ​ $ (13,448) ​ $ 2,409 ​ Operating expenses Research and development expenses For the three months ended March 31, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded $3.7 million of research and development expenses compared to $5.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2022. The decrease of $1.8 million is related primarily to a decrease of $1.8 million in clinical trials and development expenses related to ZYESAMI. The $3.7 million and $5.5 million of research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, include $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses For the three months ended March 31, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded $5.8 million of general and administrative expenses compared to $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease of $4.4 million was primarily, related to a decrease of $3.9 million in legal, professional and accounting fees, $0.6 million in insurance expenses, $0.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by $0.3 million in employee expenses and $0.3 million in consultant fees. The $5.8 million and $10.2 million of general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, include $0.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation. Other (income) expenses Interest income For the three months ended March 31, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded $0.2 million of interest income earned on the Company’s money market account. 31 Table of Contents Change in fair value of convertible note payable For the three months ended March 31, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded $1.8 million related to the change in fair value of the convertible note payable which is accounted for under the fair value option. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities For the three months ended March 31, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded a gain of less than $0.1 million related to the change in fair value of the warrant liabilities compared to a gain of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease of $0.1 million related to the decrease in the fair value of certain Substitute Warrants and the Placement Warrants assumed pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Change in fair value of Earnout Cash liability For the three months ended March 31, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded no change in fair value of the Earnout Cash liability compared to a gain of $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The Earnout Cash milestones were not achieved by December 31, 2022 and therefore the Earnout Cash liability expired. The gain for the three months ended March 31, 2022 related to the decrease in fair value of the Earnout Cash liability. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has generated no revenues, has incurred operating losses since inception, and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Until such time as the Company is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of NRX-101 will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations. On March 8, 2023, NRx Pharmaceuticals entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with accredited investors (the “Investors”), providing for the issuance and sale of 3,866,666 shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) and warrants to purchase up to 3,866,666 shares of Common Stock (the “Investor Warrants”) in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules for a purchase price of $0.75 per share (the “Offering”). The Investors have agreed not to transfer the Common Stock for six months following the date hereof. The Investor Warrants will have an exercise price of $0.75 per share, will be initially exercisable beginning six months following the date of issuance (the “Initial Exercise Date”) and will expire 5 years from the Initial Exercise Date. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering are expected to be approximately $2.9 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from such offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The closing of the sale of these securities occurred on March 9, 2023. NRx Pharmaceuticals believes that it does not currently have sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through at least the next twelve months from the date hereof. NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operating. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively affect the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company's operations.

Financing activities During the three months ended March 31, 2023, financing activities provided $2.5 million of cash resulting from $2.5 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock and warrants issued in a private placement, net of issuance costs. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, financing activities provided $23.0 million of cash resulting from the net proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of common stock and preferred investment options in a private placement. Contractual Obligations and Commitments See Note 6, Debt, and Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the Company’s commitments and contingencies. Milestone Payments Pursuant to the legal settlement with Sarah Herzog Memorial Hospital Ezrat Nashim (“SHMH”) in September 2018, which included the license of intellectual property rights from SHMH, an ongoing royalty of 1% to 2.5% of NRX-101 gross sales is due to SHMH, together with milestone payments of $0.3 million, upon completion of phase 3 trials and commercial sale of NRX-101. The milestone payments for developmental and commercial milestones range from $0.1 million to $0.8 million. Annual maintenance fees are up to $0.2 million. 33 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. The Company has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates The Company's management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the Earnout Cash Liability, stock-based compensation, and the valuation of warrants. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. Stock-based compensation We measure stock option awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value is the fair market value per share as of the grant date based on the closing trading price for the Company’s stock. The straight-line method of expense recognition is applied to awards with service-only conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock-based awards, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock-based awards, and our expected dividend yield. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded warrants on our common stock and historical volatility of a set of our publicly traded peer companies. We estimate the expected term of our options using the ""simplified"" method for awards that qualify as ""plain-vanilla"" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Warrant liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether 34 Table of Contents the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, or date of modification, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the Earnout Cash Milestone and Earnout Shares Milestone probabilities of achievement at each reporting period. Convertible note payable As permitted under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”), the Company elects to account for its convertible promissory note, which meets the required criteria, at fair value at inception and at each subsequent reporting date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as a component of non-operating loss in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of electing the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible promissory notes are expensed as incurred. ​ The Company estimates the fair value of the convertible note payable using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and estimates for the equity volatility and volume volatility of our common stock, the time to expiration of the convertible note, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the time to expiration, and probability of default. Therefore, we estimate our expected future volatility based on the actual volatility of our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock utilizing a lookback period consistent with the time to expiration. The time to expiration is based on the contractual maturity date, giving consideration to the mandatory and potential accelerated redemptions beginning six months from the issuance date. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement for time periods approximately equal to the time to expiration. Probability of default is estimated using Bloomberg's Default Risk function which uses our financial information to calculate a default risk specific to the Company. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the convertible note payable represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, the change in fair value of the convertible note payable recorded to other (income) expense could be materially different in the future. ​ 35 Table of Contents ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation as of March 31, 2023 under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who serves as our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2023 in providing reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ​ There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company’s systems evolve with its business. ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. On August 12, 2022, the Company received a demand for arbitration (the “Demand”) from GEM Yield Bahamas Limited and GEM Global Yield LLC SCS (collectively, “GEM”). The Demand claims that the Company’s subsidiary, NeuroRx, Inc. (“NeuroRx”), failed to satisfy its obligation to pay GEM a commitment fee in the amount of HK$ 15,000,000 (approximately US$1,914,087 at current exchange rates) pursuant to a Share Subscription Facility Agreement, executed on October 18, 2019, by and among NeuroRx and GEM (the “Agreement”). NeuroRx expects to vigorously defend its position that payment of the commitment fee is neither due nor owing under the terms of the Agreement. In addition to the matters described above, we may become involved in various legal actions incidental to our business. As of the date of this annual report, we are not involved in any other legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, but regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, and diversion of management resources. 36 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors We have disclosed the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report on Form 10-K”). There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk that we face.

Organization The Business On May 24, 2021 (“Effective Time”), we consummated the business combination (“Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company which applies innovative science to known molecules to develop life-saving medicines through its wholly owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company's foundation product, NRX-101 (D-cylcoserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). NRX-101 is covered by multiple U.S. and foreign patents, including a Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx Pharmaceuticals by Glytech, LLC. 2. Liquidity As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $ 18.2 million in cash. Since inception, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. The Company is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. On November 4, 2022, the Company issued an 9 % redeemable promissory note (the “Note”) to Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company, for an aggregate principal amount of $ 11,020,000 . The Company intends to use the proceeds from such issuance for general corporate purposes. The Note matures 18 months from the date of issuance subject to certain acceleration provisions as noted below. The Note carries an original issue discount of $ 1,000,000 which was deducted from the principal balance of the Note. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Note was $ 10,000,000 after transaction costs including the original issue discount, legal and other fees are included. The Company has the option to prepay the Note during the term by paying an amount equal to 110 % of the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date. The noteholder has the right to redeem up to $ 1,000,000 of the outstanding balance of the Note per month starting on the six-month anniversary of the issue date. Upon any redemption, the Company may make payments at its option in: (i) in cash, (ii) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of Common Stock with the number of redemption shares being equal to the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Conversion Price (as defined below), or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The “Redemption Conversion Price” on any given redemption date equals 85 % multiplied by the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average prices per share of the common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date that the noteholder delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the Note. Beginning May 1, 2023, in the event (a) the daily dollar trading volume of the common stock of the Company on any given trading day is at least fifty percent ( 50 %) greater than the lower of (i) the median daily dollar trading volume over the previous ten (10) trading days or (ii) the daily dollar trading volume on the trading day immediately preceding the date of measurement or (b) if the closing trade price on any given trading day is at least thirty percent ( 30 %) greater than the Nasdaq Minimum Price, then lender will be entitled to redeem over the following ten (10) trading days an amount of indebtedness then outstanding under the Note equal to twice ( 2x ) the monthly redemption amount of $ 1,000,000 solely by payment by stock, if permitted under the agreement, subject to maximum percentage and other ownership limitations. 8 Table of Contents The Company’s ongoing clinical activities continue to generate losses and net cash outflows from operations. Accordingly, the Company issued the above Note to continue to fund its research activities. The Company believes that it currently has sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through at least the next twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company’s operations. ​ 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP (the “Reverse Recapitalization”). Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The consolidated results of operations prior to the Reverse Recapitalization are those of NeuroRx. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and losses per share, prior to the Merger, have been retroactively restated based on shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Merger. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the Earnout Cash liability, valuation of common and preferred stock, stock options, warrants, and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. 9 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 11) Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are occasionally invested in certificates of deposit. The Company maintains each of its cash balances with high-quality and accredited financial institutions and accordingly, such funds are not exposed to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. The Company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the form of a money market account with a financial institution that management believes to be creditworthy. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of initial purchase to be cash equivalents, including balances held in the Company’s money market accounts. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions, in which balances from time to time may exceed the U.S. federally insured limits. The objectives of the Company’s cash management policy are to safeguard and preserve funds to maintain liquidity sufficient to meet the Company’s cash flow requirements, and to attain a market rate of return. Research and Development Costs ​ The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. For restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value is the fair market value per share as of the grant date based on the closing trading price for the Company’s stock. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the 10 Table of Contents application of management’s judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Modification of stock options and warrants A change in any of the terms or conditions of stock options and warrants is accounted for as a modification. For a Type 1 (probable-to-probable) modification, incremental stock-based compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified option/warrant over the fair value of the original option/warrant immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested stock options and warrants to board members, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested stock options, we recognize over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date. If the fair value of the modified option is lower than the fair value of the original option immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award. The accounting for incremental fair value of warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification which may result in a reduction of additional paid-in capital, recognition of costs for services rendered, or recognized as a deemed dividend. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured at fair value and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achieving Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period (see Notes 9 and 11). Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. 11 Table of Contents Loss Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, and other dilutive instruments when their effect would be anti-dilutive in the respective periods. The following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share attributable to common stock for the periods in which a net loss is presented because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30, ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, ​ ​ 2022 2021 2022 2021 Stock options ​ 2,654,579 2,388,811 2,654,579 2,388,811 Restricted stock awards ​ 1,000,000 ​ — ​ 1,000,000 ​ — Common stock warrants ​ 17,521,753 9,305,790 17,521,753 9,305,790 Earnout Shares ​ 22,209,280 ​ 22,209,280 ​ 22,209,280 ​ 22,209,280 Earnout Shares from exercised Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants ​ 1,229,925 ​ 1,229,925 ​ 1,229,925 ​ 1,229,925 ​ Since the closing of the Merger, of the 516,025 shares of common stock issued for the exercise of stock options, 185,472 shares of common stock are contingently issuable Earnout Shares and are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for computing EPS until the contingent conditions are satisfied. There are 1,044,453 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the GEM warrants which are contingently issuable Earnout Shares and are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for computing EPS until the contingent conditions are satisfied. There are 1,000,000 unvested restricted stock awards which are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for computing EPS until such shares become vested. Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2022, there were no new accounting pronouncements or updates to recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, that management believes materially affect the Company’s present or future results of operations, overall financial condition, liquidity or disclosures. ​ 4. Reverse Recapitalization As discussed in Note 1, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), BRPA and Merger Sub closed the Merger with NeuroRx, as a result of which NeuroRx became a wholly owned subsidiary of BRPA. While BRPA was the legal acquirer of NeuroRx in the Merger, for accounting purposes, the Merger is treated as a Reverse Recapitalization whereby NeuroRx is deemed to be the accounting acquirer and the historical financial statements of NeuroRx became the historical financial statements of BRPA (renamed NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) upon the closing of the Merger. Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of NeuroRx at the Closing Date consisted of 50,000,000 shares (“Closing Consideration”) of BRPA common stock (“Common Stock”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) each share of NeuroRx common stock and each share of the NeuroRx convertible preferred stock that was convertible into a share of NeuroRx common stock at a one-to-one ratio pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation, was converted into Common Stock equal to 3.16 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”). 12 Table of Contents In addition, the stockholders of NeuroRx who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time received the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock, including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of outstanding shares of NeuroRx preferred stock was converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash after consideration of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants (as further discussed below). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s stockholders who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time would have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of up to 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”), less 935,608 and 1,920,492 , respectively, which are subject to the terms and conditions of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants (each as defined below), if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NRX COVID-19 Drug (as defined in the Merger Agreement) receives emergency use authorization by the FDA and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NRX COVID-19 Drug (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $ 100.0 million in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NRX COVID-19 Drug and the listing of the NRX COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five ( 5 ) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. The Earnout Cash Milestone was recognized as a deemed dividend at the Closing Date and a contingent liability measured at its estimated fair value at the Closing Date and will be remeasured at fair value each period end thereafter until earned or December 31, 2022 (see Note 11). The Earnout Shares Milestone was recognized as a deemed dividend at the Closing date and was classified within equity (see Note 11). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash and Earnout Shares for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and therefore the amount of Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately 22,209,280 shares and $ 88.8 million, respectively. Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option or warrant to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Substitute Options” and the “Substitute Warrants,” respectively), based on an exchange ratio of 4.96 :1 (the “Option Exchange Ratio”), and would continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the original instruments. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be automatically adjusted based on the Merger Agreement such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying such option or warrant had the conversion of the legacy NeuroRx option and warrants into the Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1). If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held in escrow pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option or warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option or warrant holder. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $ 10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase 13 Table of Contents price of $10.0 million (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date.

Notes Payable Relief Therapeutics Loan On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Relief Therapeutics Loan”) with Relief Therapeutics Holding S.A. (“Relief Therapeutics”) in the amount of $ 0.5 million. The Relief Therapeutics Loan matured on April 6, 2022 and was bearing interest at 2 % per annum payable in arrears. The Relief Therapeutics Loan principal and accrued interest were paid in full on April 6, 2022 in the amount of $ 0.5 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. ​ 8. Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease The Company leases office space on a month-to-month basis. The rent expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was less than $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively. Sponsored Research Agreement with National Jewish Health On February 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“Research Agreement”) with National Jewish Health (“NJ Health”), a Colorado not-for-profit institution. Under the terms of the Research Agreement, the Company agreed to sponsor a research study at NJ Health relating to the impact of the Company’s' Aviptadil on propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in alveolar type II cells in vitro (the “Study”). In return for performance of the Study under the Research Agreement, the Company has committed to pay NJ Health approximately $ 0.4 million upon finalization of the work. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has paid NJ Health $ 0.3 million of the total committed amount. 15 Table of Contents Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Relief Therapeutics for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The Collaboration Agreement provides for funding by Relief Therapeutics of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the Collaboration Agreement. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics filed a lawsuit against the Company and its former CEO claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, which was followed by a counter claim from the Company for breach and repudiation of the Collaboration Agreement by Relief Therapeutics. On November 12, 2022, the Company and Relief Therapeutics entered into a Settlement Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”), which are intended to resolve the parties’ claims. The parties have thirty (30) days to implement the terms of the Settlement Agreement and APA and achieve closing. Upon closing, the parties will dismiss their respective claims. Please See Section 14 - Subsequent Events for a description of the settlement arrangements. Legal Proceedings From time to time the Company is involved in litigation, claims, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur. Share Subscription Facility Agreement — GEM NeuroRx previously entered into a share subscription facility agreement (“GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term which expired in October 2022. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on an Exchange (any nationally recognized stock exchange or exchange platform in the world on which the Company will list its shares), GEM grants NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares from the Company for up to an aggregate value of approximately $ 95.6 million. The agreement also included certain provisions which would not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares thus preventing its usage. If NeuroRx was listed or completes a private transaction which results in a change of control of the Company, NeuroRx would issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $ 1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the agreement. The reverse merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement would not have resulted in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue a warrant to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. The warrant was not conditional upon any further events or completion of the merger. The warrant was issued March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrant”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately partially exercise the warrant for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7.5 million. The GEM Warrant will be valid for a period of three years from the date NeuroRx’s stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or consummation of a reverse merger transaction of the type contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a contingent liability for its obligation to issue to GEM certain equity instruments at a discounted per share price. Specifically, as the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability and settlement expense of $ 39.5 million to reflect the fair value of the expected GEM Warrant to be issued. On March 28, 2021, when the GEM Warrant was issued, the Company recorded an additional charge of $ 21.4 million to reflect the increased fair value of the GEM Warrant on its grant date. Upon issuance, the GEM Warrant was equity classified and was determined to be within the scope of ASC 718, Share-Based Payments (“ASC 718”). 16 Table of Contents NeuroRx was required to register the Initial Exercised Shares on (a) the same registration statement on Form S-4 (or such other registration statement, if changed) in connection with the Merger, or (b) such other registration statement in connection with any other transaction which results in a public listing of NeuroRx. In addition, no later than 90 days following the consummation of the Big Rock merger, the Company was required to file with the SEC a registration statement to register under the Securities Act the resale by GEM of all shares issuable under the GEM Warrant other than the Initial Exercised Shares, which was filed with the Company's S-1 in July 2021. The GEM Warrant also includes “piggyback” registration rights. The GEM Warrants that were not exercised as of the Merger were modified and became Substitute Warrants ( 1,833,596 shares, adjusted for the Merger as discussed in Note 11). These Substitute Warrants were liability classified (see Note 9). The changes in fair value of these Substitute Warrants were recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of operations until these Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital. On August 12, 2022, the Company received a demand for arbitration (the “Demand”) from GEM. The Demand claims that the Company’s subsidiary, NeuroRx, failed to satisfy its obligation to pay GEM a commitment fee in the amount of HK$15.0 million (approximately US$1.9 million at current exchange rates) pursuant to the GEM Agreement. NeuroRx expects to vigorously defend its position that payment of the commitment fee is neither due nor owing under the terms of the Agreement. ​ 9. Equity Common Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value $ 0.001 . As discussed in Note 4, we have retroactively adjusted the shares issued and outstanding prior to May 24, 2021 to give effect to the Exchange Ratio established in the Merger Agreement to determine the number of shares of common stock into which they were converted. The Company sold 3,238,338 shares of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2021, and received gross proceeds of $ 31.1 million. The Company sold 7,824,727 and 3,642,515 shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and received gross proceeds of $ 23.0 million and $ 39.6 million, respectively. The Company issued 2,334,370 and 3,830,586 shares of common stock pursuant to warrants and Unit Purchase Options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, and received gross proceeds from the warrant exercise of $ 9.2 million and from the Unit Purchase Option exercise of $ 16.7 million, respectively. The Company issued 634,045 and 834,045 shares of common stock for consulting services during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, and recognized non-cash consulting expense in general and administrative expenses of $ 7.9 million and $ 12.8 million, respectively. Preferred Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value $ 0.001 . The Company has no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Common Stock Warrants Substitute Warrants As discussed in Note 4, in connection with the Merger, each warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Warrants, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the 17 Table of Contents same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant. Each Substitute Warrant will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx warrant multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Warrant that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx warrant that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Warrant had the conversion of NeuroRx warrants into the Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1) as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the warrant holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, all outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate 4,909,066 shares of the Company’s common stock with an average exercise price of $ 2.45 per share. With respect to warrants held by certain members of our Board of Directors, the Substitute Warrants were determined to be within the scope of ASC 718. For the portion of the warrants subject to the base Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1), the warrants were fully vested and therefore the incremental fair value of these Substitute Warrants at the date of the modification date was immediately recognized as compensation expense. For the incremental portion of the warrants with a performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone), the Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at June 30, 2022 and therefore no expense has been recognized for this portion. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Warrants subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. The Company recognized incremental compensation in the second quarter of 2021 on the modification date totaling $ 2.3 million which was recognized in general and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Unamortized compensation costs related to performance-based vesting conditions of these Substitute Warrants as of the modification date was $ 23.8 million. For any remaining outstanding warrants, as the warrant holders were no longer providing services at the date of the modification, in accordance with ASC 815, the Company concluded that the provisions in the Merger Agreement related to the Earnout Shares Milestone and the Earnout Cash Milestone and the contingent right to receive additional shares for these provisions precluded these Substitute Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As these Substitute Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Substitute Warrants should be recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Merger) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, with changes in fair value recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period of change. On May 24, 2021, the Company recorded a warrant liability of $ 53.3 million for the Substitute Warrants, reclassified out of additional-paid in capital $ 38.2 million representing the fair value of these NeuroRx warrants immediately before the modification as a result of the Merger, and recognized a loss of 18 Table of Contents $ 15.1 million for the incremental fair value of these Substitute Warrants which is recorded in the Change in fair value of warrant liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company recognized a loss on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2022 of less than $ 0.1 million and a gain on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 of $ 0.1 million. The Company recognized a loss on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 of $ 16.3 million and $ 0.4 million, respectively. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. As discussed above the GEM Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, and changes in the fair value of the warrant liability through the date of exercise were recognized in the statement of operations and upon exercise any remaining instruments were reclassified to additional paid-in capital and includes associated escrow shares for the contingent earnouts. The fair value of the original NeuroRx warrants and Substitute Warrants as of the Merger Date was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Warrants Substitute Warrants Strike price ​ ​ $ 7.58 -$ 15.84 ​ ​ $ 1.53 -$ 3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.57 - 3.69 ​ 0.57 - 3.69 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had 3,450,000 Public Warrants outstanding. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the Effective Time and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon their redemption or liquidation of the Company. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: Certain of the above conditions have not been met to redeem the Public Warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or 19 Table of Contents consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, no Public Warrants were exercised. Assumed Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Placement Warrants. The Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022. The Company measures the fair value of the warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s operating results for the current period. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and a loss on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2021 of less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 of $ 0.2 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. The following table provides the activity for all warrants for the respective periods. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Weighted ​ Aggregate ​ ​ ​ Remaining ​ Average ​ Intrinsic Value ​ Total Warrants ​ Term ​ Exercise Price ​ (in thousands) Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 9,305,790 ​ 3.92 ​ $ 9.09 ​ $ 4,942 Issued 8,215,963 ​ 5.50 ​ ​ 3.11 ​ ​ — Outstanding as of September 30, 2022 17,521,753 ​ 3.78 ​ $ 6.29 ​ $ — ​ Preferred Investment Options (included in above warrants table) ​ On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a private placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of common stock and Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock. The Preferred Investment Options have an exercise price of $ 3.07 per share and may be exercised any time on or after August 2, 2022. The form of the Preferred Investment Option is a warrant. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 2.94 , exercise price of $ 3.07 , term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8 %, risk-free rate of 1.60 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). The grant date fair value of these Preferred Investment Options was estimated to be $ 15.5 million on February 2, 2022 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of June 30, 2022. In addition, on February 2, 2022, the Company issued fully vested Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent with an exercise price of $ 3.99 . As these Preferred Investment Options were issued for services provided in facilitating the private placement, the Company recorded the fair value of such Preferred Investment Options as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 2.94 , exercise price of $ 3.99 , term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8 %, risk-free rate of 1.60 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). ​ 20 Table of Contents 10. Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that were subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former option. Each Substitute Option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Option that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx option that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Option had the conversion of NeuroRx options into the Substitute Options been applied using the Exchange Ratio as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. As stated in the Merger Agreement, if any Substitute Options are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 5.10 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Options as a modification of the existing options. Incremental compensation costs, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified options over the fair value of the original options immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx options and Substitute Options was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Options Substitute Options ​ Strike price ​ ​ $ 1.00 -$ 72.30 ​ ​ $ 0.20 -$ 14.58 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ 21 Table of Contents ​ The Substitute Options contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at September 30, 2022. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Options subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. For unvested Substitute Options, the Company will recognize incremental compensation over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date, taking into consideration the probability of the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone. Incremental compensation costs related to unvested Substitute Options as of the modification date was $ 25.9 million. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan At the Effective Time, the Company adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of September 30, 2022, 6,049,178 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan. As of January 1, 2022, 676,129 shares were added to the 2021 Plan under an evergreen feature that automatically increases the reserve with additional shares of Common Stock for future issuance under the Incentive Plan each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) 1 % of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) a smaller number of shares determined by the Board. The Substitute Options do not reduce the number of shares authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan. As of September 30, 2022, 4,821,754 shares have been awarded and 1,227,424 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and has limited company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the limited company-specific historical volatility and implied volatility as well as historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. The expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.

The weighted average grant date fair value per share for employee stock and non-employee option grants during the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2021, was $ 9.80 and $ 16.53 respectively. At September 30, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation related to unvested employee and non-employee stock option awards granted, including unrecognized compensation costs related to Substitute Options of $ 25.9 million, was $ 27.5 million, of which the Company expects to recognize $ 3.0 million over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. The following table summarizes the Company’s recognition of stock-based compensation for the following periods (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three months ended September 30, ​ Nine months ended September 30, ​ 2022 2021 2022 2021 Stock-based compensation expense ​ ​ ​ ​ General and administrative ​ $ 506 ​ $ 1,340 ​ $ 2,390 ​ $ 5,779 Research and development ​ 35 ​ 220 ​ 472 ​ 436 Total stock-based compensation expense ​ $ 541 ​ $ 1,560 ​ $ 2,862 ​ $ 6,215 ​ Restricted Stock Awards The following table presents the Company’s Restricted Stock Activity: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Awards ​ Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2021 ​ - ​ - Granted ​ 1,000,000 ​ $ 0.57 Unvested Balance as of September 30, 2022 ​ 1,000,000 ​ $ 0.57 ​ 23 Table of Contents On July 12, 2022, the Board granted an award of 1,000,000 restricted shares of the Company (“Restricted Stock”) as an inducement to the newly appointed CEO, pursuant to a separate Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the “RSA”). The Restricted Stock will vest in approximately equal installments over three (3) years from the grant date, subject to continued service through the applicable vesting date. As of September 30, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSAs granted was approximately $ 0.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.8 years. Stock-based compensation expense related to RSAs was less than $ 0.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. ​ ​ 11. Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for settlement and services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021. The carrying value of notes payable approximated the estimated fair values due to their recent issuances. Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The estimated fair value of the money market account represents a Level 1 measurement. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and Earnout Cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements. The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30 ​ December 31 Description Level 2022 ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ Assets: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Money Market Account ​ 1 ​ $ 16,985 ​ $ — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Warrant liabilities (Note 10) ​ 3 ​ $ 56 ​ $ 292 Earnout Cash liability (Note 4) 3 ​ $ — ​ $ 4,582 ​ Warrant liabilities The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value the Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The Company uses a modified Black-Scholes model approach for the Substitute Warrants which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black Scholes options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical and peer company volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. 24 Table of Contents The significant inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, 2022 Stock price on valuation date ​ $ 0.60 ​ Exercise price per share ​ $ 11.50 ​ Expected life ​ 3.90 ​ Volatility ​ 104.1 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 3.00 % ​ Dividend yield ​ 0.00 % ​ Fair value of warrants ​ $ 0.13 ​ ​ A reconciliation of warrant liabilities is included below (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2021 ​ $ 292 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ ( 157 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 ​ $ 135 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ ( 116 ) Balance as of June 30, 2022 ​ $ 19 Loss upon re-measurement ​ 37 Balance as of September 30, 2022 ​ $ 56 ​ Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The most significant inputs include whether (a) if the Company files an NDA, that the FDA approves the Company’s NDA for ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101, (b) if such approval is granted, whether such approval will be received on or before December 31, 2022, and (c) if such approval is granted, whether ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101 will be listed in the FDA’s Orange Book on or before December 31, 2022. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that the Company believes market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. Because (i) ZYESAMI NIH Phase III trial was stopped due to futility, and (ii) NRX-101 Phase III trial has not yet started, management estimated the probability as of September 30, 2022 of achieving the required milestones for payment of the Earnout Cash to be de minimis and therefore, the September 30, 2022 Earnout Cash liability was reduced to zero. A reconciliation of the Earnout Cash liability is included below (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, 2022 Balance as of December 31, 2021 ​ $ 4,582 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ ( 2,103 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 ​ $ 2,479 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ ( 2,479 ) Balance as of June 30, 2022 ​ $ — Balance as of September 30, 2022 ​ $ — ​ ​ ​ ​ 12. Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 25 Table of Contents For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of September 30, 2022. 13. Related Party Transactions The Company licenses patents that are owned by Glytech, LLC (“Glytech”), pursuant to a license agreement (the “Glytech Agreement”). Glytech is owned by a co-founder and former director of the Company. The Glytech Agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. During the three months ended September 30, 2022 the Company paid a co-founder $ 0.1 million, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, $ 0.2 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively, for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. These support services are ongoing. The Fourth Amendment to the Glytech Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2020, includes an equity value-triggered transfer of Excluded Technology from Glytech to NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Excluded Technology is defined in the Glytech Agreement as any technology, and any know-how related thereto, covered in the licensed patents that do not recite either D-cycloserine or lurasidone individually or jointly. This definition would cover pharmaceutical formulations, including some that NRx Pharmaceuticals considers “pipeline” or “future product” opportunities, that contain a combination of pharmaceutical components different from those contained in NRX-100 and NRX-101. The Company had the right to acquire the Excluded Technology for no additional consideration if certain conditions were satisfied prior to August 6, 2022, but the conditions were not satisfied and the Company is currently in discussions with Glytech to extend its right to acquire the Excluded Technology. The Chief Scientist of the Company, Dr. Jonathan Javitt, is a major shareholder in the Company and a member of the Board of Directors. Therefore, his services are deemed to be a related party transaction. He served the Company on a full-time basis as CEO under an employment agreement with the Company until March 8, 2022 and currently serves under a Consulting Agreement with the Company as Chief Scientist thereafter and received compensation of $0.2 million and $ 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 0.7 million and $ 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These services are ongoing. Zachary Javitt is the son of Dr. Jonathan Javitt. Zachary Javitt provides services related to website, IT, and marketing support under the supervision of the Company’s CEO and the Company’s Senior Director of Global Communications, who are responsible for assuring that the services are provided on financial terms that are at market. The Company paid this family member a total of less than $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These services are ongoing. In addition, the Company paid PillTracker for digital health product development required to track the use of Aviptadil in clinical trials. Zachary Javitt and Jonathan Javitt are the chief executive officer and board chairman, respectively, of PillTracker. PillTracker agreements and transactions are submitted to the General Counsel of the Company and the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Related Person Transactions Policy. The Master Service Agreement dated April 1, 2020 (“MSA”), and all work orders thereunder, have been suspended by mutual agreement pending the Company’s re-evaluation of its respiratory franchise. NRx Pharmaceuticals paid PillTracker $ 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2021, and $ 0.2 million and $ 0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in accounts payable were less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million due to the above related parties as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. ​ 14. Subsequent Events ​ 26 Table of Contents Financing On November 4, 2022, the Company issued an 9 % redeemable promissory note (the “Note”) to Streeterville Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company, for an aggregate principal amount of $ 11,020,000 .

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition and plan of operations together with NRx Pharmaceuticals' unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (“BRPA”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals” or the “Company”). NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing, through its wholly owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx, NRX-100 and NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Bipolar Depression in patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) and Sub-Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (“SSIB”). NRX-100 and NRX-101 were developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Dr. Daniel Javitt, MD, PhD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRX-100 and NRX-101 investigational therapy begins with a single dose of ketamine (NRX-100), a Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for bipolar depression with ASIB and SSIB. NRX-101 combines d-Cycloserine, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Biomarker Letter of Support, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline and stabilization in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS in combination with antidepressants. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a Phase 2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on data from the STABIL-B study (NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the active ingredient used in the market leading branded bipolar depression agent) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. In March 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals announced a primary focus on its psychiatry franchise and the late-stage development of NRX-101 for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality. NRX-101 is a fixed dose combination of D-cycloserine, an NMDA antagonist, and lurasidone, a 5-HT 2A atypical antipsychotic and antidepressant, for the maintenance of remission from severe bipolar depression following initial stabilization with ketamine. The previously undiscovered synergy between these two drug classes in the treatment of CNS disorders, combined with the efficacy of D-cycloserine in the treatment of depression and PTSD, is the subject of 47 issued patents and more than 43 pending patents owned by or licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. ​ 28 Table of Contents NRX-101 Lead Indication – Severe Bipolar Depression in Patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) After Initial Stabilization with ketamine ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ NRX-101 Indication – Bipolar Depression in Patients with Sub-acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SSIB) ​ ​ 29 Table of Contents ​ NRX-101 Indication – Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ​ ​ ​ ​ Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses.

Until such time as NRx Pharmaceuticals is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of NRX-101 will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals believes that it currently has sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through at least the next twelve months from the date hereof. NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operating. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively affect the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company's operations.

The Company intends to use the proceeds from such issuance for general corporate purposes. The Note matures 18 months from the date of issuance subject 34 Table of Contents to certain acceleration provisions. The Note carries an original issue discount of $1,000,000 which was deducted from the principal balance of the Note. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Note was $10,000,000 after transaction costs including the original issue discount, legal and other fees are included. The Company has the option to prepay the Note during the term by paying an amount equal to 110% of the principal, interest, and fees owed as of the prepayment date. The noteholder has the right to redeem up to $1,000,000 of the outstanding balance of the Note per month starting six months after the issuance date. Payments may be made by the Company at its option in: (i) in cash, (ii) by paying the redemption amount in the form of shares of Common Stock with the number of redemption shares being equal to the portion of the applicable redemption amount divided by the Redemption Conversion Price (as defined below), or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The “Redemption Conversion Price” on any given redemption date equals 85% multiplied by the average of the two lowest daily volume weighted average prices per share of the common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date that the noteholder delivers notice electing to redeem a portion of the Note. Beginning May 1, 2023, in the event (a) the daily dollar trading volume of the common stock of the Company on any given trading day is at least fifty percent (50%) greater than the lower of (i) the median daily dollar trading volume over the previous ten (10) trading days or (ii) the daily dollar trading volume on the trading day immediately preceding the date of measurement or (b) if the closing trade price on any given trading day is at least thirty percent (30%) greater than the Nasdaq Minimum Price, then lender will be entitled to redeem over the following ten (10) trading days an amount of indebtedness then outstanding under the Note equal to twice (2x) the monthly redemption amount of $1,000,000 solely by payment by stock, if permitted under the agreement, subject to maximum percentage and other ownership limitations. Private Placement ​ On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a private placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of common stock and Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock. The Preferred Investment Options have an exercise price of $3.07 per share and may be exercised any time on or after August 2, 2022. The form of the Preferred Investment Option is a warrant. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $2.94, exercise price of $3.07, term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8%, risk-free rate of 1.60%, and expected dividend rate of 0%). The grant date fair value of these Preferred Investment Options was estimated to be $15.5 million on February 2, 2022 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of September 30, 2022. In addition, on February 2, 2022, the Company issued fully vested Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent with an exercise price of $3.99. As these Preferred Investment Options were issued for services provided in facilitating the private placement, the Company recorded the fair value of such Preferred Investment Options as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $2.94, exercise price of $3.99, term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8%, risk-free rate of 1.60%, and expected dividend rate of 0%). Reverse Recapitalization Merger and Subsequent Equity Issuances Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100.0 million in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good 35 Table of Contents faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. At June 30, 2022, the fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated to be $0 million. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $255.8 million with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $0). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $0 million. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date. The Company received $8.1 million in net proceeds after transaction costs from the sale of PIPE Shares.

The milestone payments for developmental and commercial milestones range from $0.1 million to $0.8 million. Annual maintenance fees are up to $0.2 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements NRx Pharmaceuticals is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. NRx Pharmaceuticals has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates NRx Pharmaceuticals' management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the Earnout Cash Liability, stock-based compensation, and the valuation of warrants. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. Earnout Cash Liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The most significant inputs include whether (a) the FDA approves the Company’s NDAs for ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101, (b) if such approval is granted, whether such approval will be received on or before December 31, 2022, and (c) if such approval is granted, whether ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101 will be listed in the FDA’s Orange Book on or before December 31, 2022. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed in consideration of the uncertainties associated with the obligations. Because: (i) ZYESAMI 37 Table of Contents NIH Phase III trial was stopped due to futility, and (ii) NRX-101 Phase III trial has not yet started, management estimated the probability as of September 30, 2022 of achieving the required milestones for payment of the Earnout Cash to be de minimis and therefore, the September 30, 2022 Earnout Cash liability is zero. Changes in the estimated fair value of the Earnout Cash Liability are recognized as a gain or loss in the statements of operations. Fair value of common and preferred stock Prior to the Merger, in order to determine the fair value of shares of its common stock, the Company's board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of its common stock and preferred stock based on arms-length transactions with third party investors. Subsequent to the Merger, the Board determines the fair value of the Common Stock based on the closing market price on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation We measure stock option awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The straight-line method of expense recognition is applied to awards with service-only conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock-based awards, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock-based awards, and our expected dividend yield. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded warrants on our common stock and historical volatility of a set of our publicly traded peer companies. We estimate the expected term of our options using the ""simplified"" method for awards that qualify as ""plain-vanilla"" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Warrant liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, or date of modification, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the Earnout Cash Milestone and Earnout Shares Milestone probabilities of achievement at each reporting period. 38 Table of Contents ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures. (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (“certifying officers”) have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2022. Our certifying officers concluded that, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2022. ​ Per Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. ​ Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. The material weakness was due to ineffective risk assessment related to review procedures for complex transactions. This led to a deficiency in the design and implementation of appropriate review controls for complex warrant transactions. The material weakness resulted in a restatement of its financial statements to reclassify the Company’s Substitute Warrants as described in the Explanatory Note to this Quarterly Report. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ In light of the previously noted material weakness, we are enhancing our processes and controls to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Additionally, management is in the process of performing a risk assessment that will identify areas of increased risk in both the financial statements and business processes such as complex transactions. ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief Therapeutics”) filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) in New York State Court (the “NYS Court”), claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the collaboration 39 Table of Contents agreement dated September 18, 2020 (the “Collaboration Agreement”). which was followed by a counter claim from the Company for breach and repudiation of the Collaboration Agreement by Relief Therapeutics. On November 12, 2022, the Company and Relief Therapeutics entered into a Settlement Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”), which are intended to resolve the parties’ claims. The parties have thirty (30) days to implement the terms of the Settlement Agreement and APA and achieve closing. Upon closing, the parties will dismiss their respective claims. Please See Section 14 - Subsequent Events for a description of the settlement arrangements. On August 12, 2022, the Company received a demand for arbitration (the “Demand”) from GEM Yield Bahamas Limited and GEM Global Yield LLC SCS (collectively, “GEM”). The Demand claims that the Company’s subsidiary, NeuroRx, Inc. (“NeuroRx""), failed to satisfy its obligation to pay GEM a commitment fee in the amount of HK$ 15,000,000 (approximately US$1,914,087 at current exchange rates) pursuant to a Share Subscription Facility Agreement, executed on October 18, 2019, by and among NeuroRx and GEM (the “Agreement”). NeuroRx expects to vigorously defend its position that payment of the commitment fee is neither due nor owing under the terms of the Agreement. ​ In addition to the matters described above, we may become involved in various legal actions incidental to our business. As of the date hereof, we are not involved in any other legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, but regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, and diversion of management resources. ​ Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have disclosed the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report on Form 10-K”). There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or may not be able to assess, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a Private Placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of $3.195 per share and the Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $3.07 per share from August 2, 2022 through August 2, 2027 (collectively, the “Securities”). The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $25.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. In connection with this Private Placement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the purchasers of the Securities. The Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 to register the Securities was declared effective on June 21, 2022. ​ Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. ​ Item 4.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021 (“Effective Time”), we consummated the business combination (“Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company which applies innovative science to known molecules to develop life-saving medicines through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company's foundation product, NRX-101 (D-cylcoserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients with suicidality, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). NRX-101 is covered by multiple U.S. and foreign patents, including a Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx Pharmaceuticals by Glytech, LLC. The Company is re-evaluating its respiratory franchise after a National Institute of Health (NIH) Phase III study of the Company’s product for the treatment of acute respiratory distress in Critical COVID-19 patients, ZYESAMI, was stopped due to futility. 2. Liquidity As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 24.5 million in cash. Since inception, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable. The Company is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. On August 23, 2021, the Company completed a private placement and issued 2,727,273 shares of common stock and preferred investment options to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,727,273 shares of common stock. The purchase price for one share of common stock and one preferred investment option was $ 11.00 . The preferred investment options have an exercise price of $ 12.00 . The net proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $ 27.4 million. On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a private placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of common stock and preferred investment options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock. The purchase price for one share of common stock and one preferred investment option was $ 3.195 . The preferred investment options have an exercise price of $ 3.07 per share. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $ 22.6 million. The Company believes that it currently has sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through at least the next twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company’s operations. 7 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP (the “Reverse Recapitalization”). Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The consolidated results of operations prior to the Reverse Recapitalization are those of NeuroRx. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and losses per share, prior to the Merger, have been retroactively restated based on shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Merger. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the Earnout Cash liability, valuation of common and preferred stock, stock options, warrants, and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 8 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 11) Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are occasionally invested in certificates of deposit. The Company maintains each of its cash balances with high-quality and accredited financial institutions and accordingly, such funds are not exposed to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. The Company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the form of a money market account with a financial institution that management believes to be creditworthy. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of initial purchase to be cash equivalents, including balances held in the Company’s money market accounts. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions, in which balances from time to time may exceed the U.S. federally insured limits. The objectives of the Company’s cash management policy are to safeguard and preserve funds to maintain liquidity sufficient to meet the Company’s cash flow requirements, and to attain a market rate of return. Research and Development Costs ​ The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Modification of stock options and warrants A change in any of the terms or conditions of stock options and warrants is accounted for as a modification. For a Type 1 (probable-to-probable) modification, incremental stock-based compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified option/warrant over the fair value of the original option/warrant immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested stock options and warrants to board members, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested stock options, we recognize over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date. If the fair value of the modified option is lower than the fair value of the original option immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award. The accounting for incremental fair value of warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification which may result in a reduction of additional paid-in capital, recognition of costs for services rendered, or recognized as a deemed dividend. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured at fair value and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achieving Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period (see Notes 9 and 11). Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. 10 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Loss Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.

Reverse Recapitalization As discussed in Note 1, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), BRPA and Merger Sub closed the Merger with NeuroRx, as a result of which NeuroRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRPA. While BRPA was the legal acquirer of NeuroRx in the Merger, for accounting purposes, the Merger is treated as a Reverse Recapitalization whereby NeuroRx is deemed to be the accounting acquirer and the historical financial statements of NeuroRx became the historical financial statements of BRPA (renamed NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) upon the closing of the Merger. Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of NeuroRx at the Closing Date consisted of 50,000,000 shares (“Closing Consideration”) of BRPA common stock (“Common Stock”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) each share of NeuroRx common stock and each share of the NeuroRx convertible preferred stock that was convertible into a share of NeuroRx common stock at a one-to-one ratio pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation, was converted into Common Stock equal to 3.16 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”). In addition, the stockholders of NeuroRx who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time received the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock, including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of outstanding shares of NeuroRx preferred stock was converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash after consideration of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants (as further discussed below). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s stockholders who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time would have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of up to 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”), less 935,608 and 1,920,492 , respectively, which are subject to the terms and conditions of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants (each as defined below), if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NRX COVID-19 Drug (as defined in the Merger Agreement) receives emergency use authorization by the FDA and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NRX COVID-19 Drug (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $ 100.0 million in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NRX COVID-19 Drug and the listing of the NRX COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five ( 5 ) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout 12 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. The Earnout Cash Milestone was recognized as a deemed dividend at the Closing Date and a contingent liability measured at its estimated fair value at the Closing Date and will be remeasured at fair value each period end thereafter until earned or December 31, 2022 (see Note 11). The Earnout Shares Milestone was recognized as a deemed dividend at the Closing date and was classified within equity (see Note 11). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash and Earnout Shares for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and therefore the amount of Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately 22,209,280 shares and $ 88.8 million, respectively. Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option or warrant to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Substitute Options” and the “Substitute Warrants,” respectively), based on an exchange ratio of 4.96:1 (the “Option Exchange Ratio”), and would continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the original instruments. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be automatically adjusted based on the Merger Agreement such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying such option or warrant had the conversion of the legacy NeuroRx option and warrants into the Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1). If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held in escrow pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option or warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option or warrant holder. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $ 10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $ 10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date.

The Relief Therapeutics Loan principal and accrued interest were paid in full on April 6, 2022 in the amount of $ 0.5 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. ​ 8. Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease The Company leases office space on a month-to-month basis. The rent expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was less than $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively. Sponsored Research Agreement with National Jewish Health On February 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“Research Agreement”) with National Jewish Health (“NJ Health”), a Colorado not-for-profit institution. Under the terms of the Research Agreement, the Company agreed to sponsor a research study at NJ Health relating to the impact of the Company’s' Aviptadil on propagation 15 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of SARS-CoV-2 in alveolar type II cells in vitro (the “Study”). In return for performance of the Study under the Research Agreement, the Company has committed to pay NJ Health approximately $ 0.4 million upon finalization of the work. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has paid NJ Health $ 0.3 million of the total committed amount. Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Relief Therapeutics for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The Collaboration Agreement provides for funding by Relief Therapeutics of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the Collaboration Agreement. Relief Therapeutics reimbursed the Company $ 10.9 million but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs of research and development. The Company advised Relief Therapeutics that the Company is funding those costs with other capital. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics filed a lawsuit against the Company and its former CEO claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. Relief Therapeutics’ complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. The Company believes the lawsuit is baseless and without merit. On January 10, 2022, the Company filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming Relief Therapeutics breached and repudiated the Collaboration Agreement. The Company’s complaint seeks damages of at least $ 185.0 million. Efforts to resolve the litigation through mediation have not been successful, but the parties continue to seek a mutually acceptable resolution to the claims. If such a resolution cannot be found, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute its claims against Relief Therapeutics. Legal Proceedings From time to time the Company is involved in litigation, claims, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur. Share Subscription Facility Agreement — GEM NeuroRx previously entered into a share subscription facility agreement (“GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term which expires in October 2022. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on an Exchange (any nationally recognized stock exchange or exchange platform in the world on which the Company will list its shares), GEM grants NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares from the Company for up to an aggregate value of approximately $ 95.6 million. The agreement also included certain provisions which would not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares thus preventing its usage. If NeuroRx was listed or completes a private transaction which results in a change of control of the Company, NeuroRx would issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $ 1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the agreement. The reverse merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement would not have resulted in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue a warrant to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. The warrant was not conditional upon any further events or completion of the merger. The warrant was issued March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrant”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately partially exercise the warrant for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7,500,018 . The GEM Warrant will be valid for a period of 16 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS three years from the date NeuroRx’s stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or consummation of a reverse merger transaction of the type contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a contingent liability for its obligation to issue to GEM certain equity instruments at a discounted per share price. Specifically, as the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability and settlement expense of $ 39,486,139 to reflect the fair value of the expected GEM Warrant to be issued. On March 28, 2021, when the GEM Warrant was issued, the Company recorded an additional charge of $ 21,365,641 to reflect the increased fair value of the GEM Warrant on its grant date. Upon issuance, the GEM Warrant was equity classified and was determined to be within the scope of ASC 718, Share-Based Payments (“ASC 718”). NeuroRx was required to register the Initial Exercised Shares on (a) the same registration statement on Form S-4 (or such other registration statement, if changed) in connection with the Merger, or (b) such other registration statement in connection with any other transaction which results in a public listing of NeuroRx. In addition, no later than 90 days following the consummation of the Big Rock merger, the Company was required to file with the SEC a registration statement to register under the Securities Act the resale by GEM of all shares issuable under the GEM Warrant other than the Initial Exercised Shares, which was filed with the Company's S-1 in July 2021. The GEM Warrant also includes “piggyback” registration rights. The GEM Warrants that were not exercised as of the Merger were modified and became Substitute Warrants ( 1,833,596 shares, adjusted for the Merger as discussed in Note 11). These Substitute Warrants were liability classified (see Note 9). The changes in fair value of these Substitute Warrants were recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of operations until these Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital. On August 12, 2022, the Company received a demand for arbitration (the “Demand”) from GEM. The Demand claims that the Company’s subsidiary, NeuroRx, failed to satisfy its obligation to pay GEM a commitment fee in the amount of HK$15,000,000 (approximately US$1,914,087 at current exchange rates) pursuant to the GEM Agreement. NeuroRx expects to vigorously defend its position that payment of the commitment fee is neither due nor owing under the terms of the Agreement. ​ ​ 9. Equity Common Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value $ 0.001 . As discussed in Note 4, we have retroactively adjusted the shares issued and outstanding prior to May 24, 2021 to give effect to the Exchange Ratio established in the Merger Agreement to determine the number of shares of common stock into which they were converted. The Company sold 65,526 shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2021, and received gross proceeds of $ 1.4 million. The Company sold 7,824,727 and 1,894,863 shares of common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and received gross proceeds of $23.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively. Preferred Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value $ 0.001 . The Company has no shares of preferred stock outstanding. 17 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Common Stock Warrants Substitute Warrants As discussed in Note 4, in connection with the Merger, each warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Warrants, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant. Each Substitute Warrant will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx warrant multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Warrant that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx warrant that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Warrant had the conversion of NeuroRx warrants into the Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1) as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the warrant holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, all outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate 4,909,066 shares of the Company’s common stock with an average exercise price of $ 2.45 per share. With respect to warrants held by certain members of our Board of Directors, the Substitute Warrants were determined to be within the scope of ASC 718. For the portion of the warrants subject to the base Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1), the warrants were fully vested and therefore the incremental fair value of these Substitute Warrants at the date of the modification date was immediately recognized as compensation expense. For the incremental portion of the warrants with a performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone), the Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at June 30, 2022 and therefore no expense has been recognized for this portion. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Warrants subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. The Company recognized incremental compensation in the second quarter of 2021 on the modification date totaling $ 2.3 million which was recognized in general and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Unamortized compensation costs related to performance-based vesting conditions of these Substitute Warrants as of the modification date was $ 23.8 million. 18 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For any remaining outstanding warrants, as the warrant holders were no longer providing services at the date of the modification, in accordance with ASC 815, the Company concluded that the provisions in the Merger Agreement related to the Earnout Shares Milestone and the Earnout Cash Milestone and the contingent right to receive additional shares for these provisions precluded these Substitute Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As these Substitute Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Substitute Warrants should be recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Merger) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, with changes in fair value recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period of change. On May 24, 2021, the Company recorded a warrant liability of $53.3 million for the Substitute Warrants, reclassified out of additional-paid in capital $38.2 million representing the fair value of these NeuroRx warrants immediately before the modification as a result of the Merger, and recognized a loss of $15.1 million for the incremental fair value of these Substitute Warrants which is recorded in the Change in fair value of warrant liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 of $15.9 million. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. As discussed above the GEM Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, and changes in the fair value of the warrant liability through the date of exercise were recognized in the statement of operations and upon exercise any remaining instruments were reclassified to additional paid-in capital and includes associated escrow shares for the contingent earnouts. The fair value of the original NeuroRx warrants and Substitute Warrants as of the Merger Date was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Warrants Substitute Warrants Strike price ​ ​ $ 7.58 -$ 15.84 ​ ​ $ 1.53 -$ 3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.57 - 3.69 ​ 0.57 - 3.69 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had 3,450,000 Public Warrants outstanding. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the Effective Time and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon their redemption or liquidation of the Company. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: 19 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Certain of the above conditions have not been met to redeem the Public Warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, no Public Warrants were exercised. Assumed Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Placement Warrants. The Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2022. The Company measures the fair value of the warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s operating results for the current period. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 of $ 0.1 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 of $ 0.1 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Preferred Investment Options (included in above warrants table) On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a private placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of common stock and Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock. The Preferred Investment Options have an exercise price of $ 3.07 per share and may be exercised any time on or after August 2, 2022. The form of the Preferred Investment Option is a warrant. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 2.94 , exercise price of $ 3.07 , term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8 %, risk-free rate of 1.60 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). The grant date fair value of these Preferred Investment Options was estimated to be $ 15.5 million on February 2, 2022 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of June 30, 2022. In addition, on February 2, 2022, the Company issued fully vested Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent with an exercise price of $ 3.99 . As these Preferred Investment Options were issued for services provided in facilitating the private placement, the Company recorded the fair value of such Preferred Investment Options as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 2.94 , exercise price of $ 3.99 , term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8 %, risk-free rate of 1.60 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). ​ 10. Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that were subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former option. Each Substitute Option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Option that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx option that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Option had the conversion of NeuroRx options into the Substitute Options been applied using the Exchange Ratio as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As stated in the Merger Agreement, if any Substitute Options are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 5.10 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Options as a modification of the existing options. Incremental compensation costs, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified options over the fair value of the original options immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx options and Substitute Options was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Options Substitute Options ​ Strike price ​ ​ $ 1.00 -$ 72.30 ​ ​ $ 0.20 -$ 14.58 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ The Substitute Options contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at June 30, 2022. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Options subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. For unvested Substitute Options, the Company will recognize incremental compensation over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date, taking into consideration the probability of the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone. Incremental compensation costs related to unvested Substitute Options as of the modification date was $ 25.9 million. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan At the Effective Time, the Company adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of June 30, 2022, 6,049,178 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan. As of January 1, 2022, 676,129 shares were added to the 2021 Plan under an evergreen feature that automatically increases the reserve with additional shares of Common Stock for future issuance under the Incentive Plan each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) 1% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) a smaller number of shares determined by the Board. The Substitute Options do not reduce the number of shares authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan. As of June 30, 2022, 4,953,290 shares have been awarded and 1,095,888 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. 22 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and has limited company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the limited company-specific historical volatility and implied volatility as well as historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. The expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for settlement and services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021. The carrying value of notes payable approximated the estimated fair values due to their recent issuances. Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The estimated fair value of the money market account represents a Level 1 measurement. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and Earnout Cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements. The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30 ​ December 31 Description Level 2022 ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ Assets: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Money Market Account ​ 1 ​ $ 23,500 ​ $ — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Warrant liabilities (Note 10) ​ 3 ​ $ 19 ​ $ 292 Earnout Cash liability (Note 4) 3 ​ $ — ​ $ 4,582 ​ Warrant liabilities The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value the Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The Company uses a modified Black-Scholes model approach for the Substitute Warrants which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black Scholes options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical and peer company volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. 24 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The significant inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, 2022 Stock price on valuation date ​ $ 0.60 ​ Exercise price per share ​ $ 11.50 ​ Expected life ​ 3.90 ​ Volatility ​ 104.1 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 3.00 % ​ Dividend yield ​ 0.00 % ​ Fair value of warrants ​ $ 0.13 ​ ​ A reconciliation of warrant liabilities is included below (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2021 ​ $ 292 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ ( 157 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 ​ $ 135 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ( 116 ) Balance as of June 30, 2022 ​ $ 19 ​ Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The most significant inputs include whether (a) if the Company files an NDA, that the FDA approves the Company’s NDA for ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101, (b) if such approval is granted, whether such approval will be received on or before December 31, 2022, and (c) if such approval is granted, whether ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101 will be listed in the FDA’s Orange Book on or before December 31, 2022. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that the Company believes market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. Because (i) ZYESAMI NIH Phase III trial was stopped due to futility, and (ii) NRX-101 Phase III trial has not yet started, management estimated the probability as of June 30, 2022 of achieving the required milestones for payment of the Earnout Cash to be de minimis and therefore, the June 30, 2022 Earnout Cash liability was reduced to zero. A reconciliation of the Earnout Cash liability is included below (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, 2022 Balance as of December 31, 2021 ​ $ 4,582 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ​ ( 2,103 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 ​ $ 2,479 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ( 2,479 ) Balance as of June 30, 2022 ​ $ — ​ ​ 12. Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 25 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of June 30, 2022. 13. Related Party Transactions The Company licenses patents that are owned by Glytech, LLC (“Glytech”), pursuant to a license agreement (the “Glytech Agreement”). Glytech is owned by a co-founder and former director of the Company. The Glytech Agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. During the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 the Company paid a co-founder $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively, and during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively, for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. These support services are ongoing. The Fourth Amendment to the Glytech Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2020, includes an equity value-triggered transfer of Excluded Technology from Glytech to NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Excluded Technology is defined in the Glytech Agreement as any technology, and any know-how related thereto, covered in the licensed patents that do not recite either D-cycloserine or lurasidone individually or jointly. This definition would cover pharmaceutical formulations, including some that NRx Pharmaceuticals considers “pipeline” or “future product” opportunities, that contain a combination of pharmaceutical components different from those contained in NRX-100 and NRX-101. The Company had the right to acquire the Excluded Technology for no additional consideration if certain conditions were satisfied prior to August 6, 2022, but the conditions were not satisfied and the Company is currently in discussions with Glytech to extend its right to acquire the Excluded Technology. The Chief Scientist of the Company, Dr. Jonathan Javitt, is a major shareholder in the Company and a member of the Board of Directors. Therefore, his services are deemed to be a related party transaction. He served the Company on a full-time basis as CEO under an employment agreement with the Company until March 8, 2022 and currently serves under a Consulting Agreement with the Company as Chief Scientist thereafter and received compensation of $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 0.4 million and $ 0.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These services are ongoing. Zachary Javitt is the son of Dr. Jonathan Javitt. Zachary Javitt provides services related to website, IT, and marketing support under the supervision of the Company’s CEO and the Company’s Senior Director of Global Communications, who are responsible for assuring that the services are provided on financial terms that are at market. The Company paid this family member a total of less than $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These services are ongoing. In addition, the Company paid PillTracker for digital health product development required to track the use of Aviptadil in clinical trials. Zachary Javitt and Jonathan Javitt are the chief executive officer and board chairman, respectively, of PillTracker. PillTracker agreements and transactions are submitted to the General Counsel of the Company and the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Related Person Transactions Policy. The Master Service Agreement dated April 1, 2020 (“MSA”), and all work orders thereunder, have been suspended by mutual agreement pending the Company’s re-evaluation of its respiratory franchise. NRx Pharmaceuticals paid PillTracker $ 0.0 million and $ 0.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 0.2 million and $ 0.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in accounts payable were less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million due to the above related parties as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 26 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition and plan of operations together with NRx Pharmaceuticals' unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (“BRPA”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals” or the “Company”). NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing, through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx, NRX-100 and NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Bipolar Depression in patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) and Sub-Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (“SSIB”), and ZYESAMI ® (aviptadil), an intravenous and inhaled drug to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19 and potentially other respiratory disorders. NRX-100 and NRX-101 were developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Dr. Daniel Javitt, MD, PhD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRX-100 and NRX-101 therapy begins with a single dose of ketamine (NRX-100), a Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for bipolar depression with ASIB and SSIB. NRX-101 combines d-Cycloserine, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Biomarker Letter of Support, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline and stabilization in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS in combination with antidepressants. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a Phase 2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on data from the STABIL-B study (NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the active ingredient used in the market leading branded bipolar depression agent) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. NRx Pharmaceuticals initiated a Phase II clinical study of Bipolar Depression with Subacute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SSIB) in the second quarter of 2022 for which enrollment has begun. The Company plans to initiate a registrational study for Bipolar Depression in patients with ASIB in the latter part of 2022. In March 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals initiated development of RLF-100 (aviptadil acetate) (now reformulated as ZYESAMI by NRx Pharmaceuticals) in partnership with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG. ZYESAMI is based on 50 years of research, pioneered by Professor Sami Said, on the role of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/Aviptadil in preventing and treating acute lung injury. Development work on ZYESAMI has been suspended following a decision by the National Institute of Health (NIH) in May 2022 to stop its ACTIV-3b Critical Care Study evaluating ZYESAMI due to futility. The Company is re-evaluating its respiratory franchise but has no plans to invest further resources in ZYESAMI. Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $7.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 28 Table of Contents 30, 2022 and 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $20.4 million and $25.6 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals had an accumulated deficit of $203.7 million. ​ Components of Results of Operations Operating expenses Research and development expenses NRx Pharmaceuticals’ research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with NRx Pharmaceuticals’ clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and equity-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation, consultant fees, and professional fees for legal and accounting services. Settlement Expense Settlement expense consists primarily of settlement expenses related to the GEM Warrant. See Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies – Share Subscription Facility Agreement – GEM” of the notes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. Reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics Reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics consisted of reimbursable expenses as part of the Collaboration Agreement.

Results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 The following table sets forth NRx Pharmaceuticals’ selected statements of operations data for the following periods (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three months ended June 30, ​ Change ​ ​ 2022 2021 Dollars ​ ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating expenses: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Research and development ​ $ 2,958 ​ $ 4,659 ​ $ (1,701) ​ General and administrative ​ 6,642 ​ 12,458 ​ ​ (5,816) ​ Total operating expenses ​ ​ 9,600 ​ ​ 17,117 ​ ​ (7,517) ​ Loss from operations ​ $ (9,600) ​ $ (17,117) ​ $ 7,517 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other (income) expenses: ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest income ​ $ (23) ​ $ — ​ $ (23) ​ Interest expense ​ — ​ 5 ​ ​ (5) ​ Change in fair value of warrant liabilities ​ (116) ​ (17,359) ​ ​ 17,243 ​ Change in fair value of Earnout Cash liability ​ (2,479) ​ 355 ​ ​ (2,834) ​ Total other (income) expenses ​ (2,618) ​ (16,999) ​ ​ 14,381 ​ Net loss ​ $ (6,982) ​ $ (118) ​ $ (6,864) ​ ​ 29 Table of Contents Operating expenses Research and development expenses For the three months ended June 30, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded $3.0 million of research and development expenses compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease of $1.7 million related primarily to a decrease of $2.1 million in clinical trials and development expenses related to ZYESAMI, partially offset by an increase of less than $0.4 million in other regulatory and process development expenses related principally to ZYESAMI. The $3.0 million and $4.7 million of research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, include $0.2 million and less than $0.2 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses For the three months ended June 30, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded $6.6 million of general and administrative expenses compared to $12.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease of $5.8 million was primarily, related to a decrease of $3.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and a decrease of $4.4 million of consultant fees, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in insurance expense and $0.2 million in other general and administrative expense. The $6.6 million and $12.5 million of general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, include $1.7 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation. Other (income) expenses Interest income For the three months ended June 30, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded less than $0.1 million of interest income. The increase of less than $0.1 million related primarily to the earned interest income on the money market account.

Until such time as NRx Pharmaceuticals is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of NRX-101 will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals believes that it currently has sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through at least the next twelve months from the date hereof. NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operating. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively affect the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company's operations. ​ 32 Table of Contents Private Placement On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a private placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of common stock and Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock. The Preferred Investment Options have an exercise price of $3.07 per share and may be exercised any time on or after August 2, 2022. The form of the Preferred Investment Option is a warrant. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $2.94, exercise price of $3.07, term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8%, risk-free rate of 1.60%, and expected dividend rate of 0%). The grant date fair value of these Preferred Investment Options was estimated to be $15.5 million on February 2, 2022 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of June 30, 2022. In addition, on February 2, 2022, the Company issued fully vested Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent with an exercise price of $3.99. As these Preferred Investment Options were issued for services provided in facilitating the private placement, the Company recorded the fair value of such Preferred Investment Options as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $2.94, exercise price of $3.99, term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8%, risk-free rate of 1.60%, and expected dividend rate of 0%). Reverse Recapitalization Merger and Subsequent Equity Issuances Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100.0 million in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. At June 30, 2022, the fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated to be $0 million. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $255.8 million with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $0). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $0 million. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date. The Company received $8.1 million in net proceeds after transaction costs from the sale of PIPE Shares. ​ 33 Table of Contents The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the periods shown below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, 2022 ​ December 31, 2021 ​ (Unaudited) ​ Balance Sheet Data: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash ​ $ 24,548 ​ $ 27,605 Total assets ​ ​ 32,433 ​ ​ 32,729 Earnout cash liability ​ ​ — ​ ​ 4,582 Total liabilities ​ ​ 7,081 ​ ​ 11,923 Total stockholders' equity (deficit) ​ ​ 25,352 ​ ​ 20,806 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, ​ ​ 2022 2021 ​ ​ (Unaudited) Statement of Cash Flow Data: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net cash used in operating activities ​ $ (25,171) ​ $ (14,409) Net cash used in investing activities ​ (6) ​ (3) Net cash provided by financing activities ​ ​ 22,120 ​ ​ 25,939 Net (decrease) increase in cash ​ $ (3,057) ​ $ 11,527 ​ Operating activities During the six months ended June 30, 2022, operating activities used $25.2 million of cash, primarily resulting from a net loss of $20.4 million, increased by net non-cash gains of $2.5 million, including $4.6 million of gain from the change in fair value of earn out liability and $0.3 million of gain from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities, partially offset by $2.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, and an increase in net operating assets of $2.2 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, operating activities used $14.4 million of cash, primarily resulting from a net loss of $25.6 million, reduced by non-cash charges of $13.8 million, including $21.4 million of non-cash settlement expense related to the GEM Warrant, $4.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.4 million of change in fair value of earnout cash liability, partially offset by a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million and $17.4 million in gain from the change in fair value of warrant liability and an increase in net operating assets of $2.6 million. Financing activities During the six months ended June 30, 2022, financing activities provided $22.1 million of cash resulting from $22.6 million in net proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of common stock and preferred investment options in a private placement partially offset by $0.5 million of repayment of Relief Therapeutics loan. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, financing activities provided $25.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from $11.1 million for the effect of the merger, net of transaction costs, $8.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of shares of NeuroRx common stock and $7.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of NeuroRx common stock for the exercise of the GEM Warrants. ​ Contractual Obligations and Commitments See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to NRx Pharmaceuticals’ unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended months ended and six months ended June 30, 2022 included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of NRx Pharmaceuticals' commitments and contingencies. Milestone Payments Pursuant to the legal settlement with Sarah Herzog Memorial Hospital Ezrat Nashim (“SHMH”) in September 2018, which included the license of intellectual property rights from SHMH, an ongoing royalty of 1% to 2.5% of NRX-101 gross sales is due to SHMH, together with milestone payments of $0.3 million, upon completion of phase 3 trials and commercial sale of NRX-101. The milestone payments for developmental and commercial milestones range from $0.1 million to $0.8 million. Annual maintenance fees are up to $0.2 million. 34 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements NRx Pharmaceuticals is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. NRx Pharmaceuticals has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates NRx Pharmaceuticals' management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the Earnout Cash Liability, stock-based compensation, and the valuation of warrants. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. Earnout Cash Liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The most significant inputs include whether (a) the FDA approves the Company’s NDAs for ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101, (b) if such approval is granted, whether such approval will be received on or before December 31, 2022, and (c) if such approval is granted, whether ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101 will be listed in the FDA’s Orange Book on or before December 31, 2022. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed in consideration of the uncertainties associated with the obligations. Because: (i) ZYESAMI NIH Phase III trial was stopped due to futility, and (ii) NRX-101 Phase III trial has not yet started, management estimated the probability as of June 30, 2022 of achieving the required milestones for payment of the Earnout Cash to be de minimis and therefore, the June 30, 2022 Earnout Cash liability was reduced to zero. Changes in the estimated fair value of the Earnout Cash Liability are recognized as a gain or loss in the statements of operations. Fair value of common and preferred stock Prior to the Merger, in order to determine the fair value of shares of its common stock, the Company's board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of its common stock and preferred stock based on arms-length transactions with third party investors. Subsequent to the Merger, the Board determines the fair value of the Common Stock based on the closing market price on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation We measure stock option awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The straight-line method of expense recognition is applied to awards with service-only conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur. 35 Table of Contents We estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock-based awards, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock-based awards, and our expected dividend yield. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded warrants on our common stock and historical volatility of a set of our publicly traded peer companies. We estimate the expected term of our options using the ""simplified"" method for awards that qualify as ""plain-vanilla"" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Warrant liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, or date of modification, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the Earnout Cash Milestone and Earnout Shares Milestone probabilities of achievement at each reporting period. ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures. (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (“certifying officers”) have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of June 30, 2022. Our certifying officers concluded that, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2022. ​ Per Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or 36 Table of Contents submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. ​ Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. The material weakness was due to ineffective risk assessment related to review procedures for complex transactions. This led to a deficiency in the design and implementation of appropriate review controls for complex warrant transactions. The material weakness resulted in a restatement of its financial statements to reclassify the Company’s Substitute Warrants as described in the Explanatory Note to this Quarterly Report. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ In light of the restatement of our financial statements included in this amendment, we plan to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Management is in the process of implementing remediation procedures to address the control deficiency that led to the material weakness. The remediation plan included, but is not limited to, the implementation of additional review procedures regarding the method for accounting for warrants issued in connection with an equity transaction. ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief Therapeutics”) filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) in New York State Court (the “NYS Court”), claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the collaboration agreement dated September 18, 2020 (the “Collaboration Agreement”). The Complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. The Company believes that the claims are baseless and without merit. On January 10, 2022, the Company filed a complaint in NYS Court, claiming Relief Therapeutics breached and repudiated the Collaboration Agreement. The Company’s complaint seeks damages of at least $185 million. Efforts to resolve the litigation through mediation have not been successful, but the parties continue to seek a mutually acceptable resolution to the claims. If such a resolution cannot be found, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute its claims against Relief Therapeutics. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our claims or in our opposition to Relief Therapeutics’ claims. On June 13, 2022, the plaintiffs in the securities class action lawsuit captioned “Dal Bosco v. NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al.” filed a notice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware voluntarily dismissing the action against NRx Pharmaceuticals and its former officers. ​ On August 12, 2022, the Company received a demand for arbitration (the “Demand”) from GEM Yield Bahamas Limited and GEM Global Yield LLC SCS (collectively, “GEM”). The Demand claims that the Company’s subsidiary, NeuroRx, Inc. (“NeuroRx""), failed to satisfy its obligation to pay GEM a commitment fee in the amount of HK$ 15,000,000 (approximately US$1,914,087 at current exchange rates) pursuant to a Share Subscription Facility Agreement, executed on October 18, 2019, by and among NeuroRx and GEM (the “Agreement”). NeuroRx expects to 37 Table of Contents vigorously defend its position that payment of the commitment fee is neither due nor owing under the terms of the Agreement. ​ In addition to the matters described above, we may become involved in various legal actions incidental to our business. As of the date hereof, we are not involved in any other legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, but regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, and diversion of management resources. ​ Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have disclosed the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report on Form 10-K”). There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or may not be able to assess, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a Private Placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of $3.195 per share and the Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $3.07 per share from August 2, 2022 through August 2, 2027 (collectively, the “Securities”). The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $25.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. In connection with this Private Placement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the purchasers of the Securities. The Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 to register the Securities was declared effective on June 21, 2022. ​ Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. ​ Item 4.

(the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021 (this “Quarterly Report”) to amend and restate certain items in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021 originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 15, 2021 (the “Original Quarterly Report”). The Original Quarterly Report should no longer be relied upon due to insufficient review procedures related to complex warrant transactions. Background of Restatement In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, we determined the accounting for contingent features of substitute warrants issued in connection with the May 24, 2021 Merger Agreement (the “Merger”) between Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”) and NeuroRx, Inc. (“NeuroRx”), that resulted in NeuroRx becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRPA which was subsequently renamed NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as reported in our previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as of and for the periods ended June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021 (collectively the “Affected Periods”) was incorrect. The error had no impact on our cash balances or operating cash flows for the Affected Periods. The error did not have a material impact on the Company's annual consolidated financial statements included in its 2021 Form 10-K. ​ Certain substitute warrants were equity-classified at the time of the Merger. Rather, they should have been recognized at fair value as a liability-classified derivative instrument as of the date of the Merger. The impact of the error on our condensed consolidated statements of operations is approximately: (i) a $15.9 million reduction in the net loss from $16.0 million to $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and from approximately $41.5 million to $25.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and (ii) an increase in the net loss of approximately $16.3 million from approximately $20.8 million to $37.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and approximately $0.4 million from approximately $62.3 million to $62.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The impact of the error on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement financial position as of June 30, 2021 is an increase to warrant liabilities of approximately $22.3 million, a decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $38.2 million and a decrease in accumulated deficit of approximately $15.9 million. The impact of the error on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement financial position as of September 30, 2021 is an increase to warrant liabilities of approximately $0.5 million, a decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $0.1 million and an increase in accumulated deficit of approximately $0.4 million. ​ Internal Control Considerations For a discussion of management’s consideration of our disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls over financial reporting, and the material weakness identified, see Part I, Item 4, “Controls and Procedures” of this Amended Form 10-Q/A. ​ ​ ​ Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ Page PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION ​ ITEM 1.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021 (“Effective Time”), we consummated the business combination (“Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRX Pharmaceuticals. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company that develops novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and both the treatment and prevention of life-threatening pulmonary diseases through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company's foundation product, NRX-101 (d-Cyloserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of suicidal bipolar depression, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). NRX-101 is covered by multiple US and foreign patents, including a recently-issued Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx by Glytech, Inc. On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief”) for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The collaboration agreement provides for funding by Relief of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territori es. Relief has reimbursed the Company $ 10.9 million for expenses but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs of the IV clinical trial, formulation and manufacture of Aviptadil (reformulated as ZYESAMI®). Relief has additionally declined to fund the costs of the inhaled ZYESAMI clinical trial. The Company advised Relief that the Company is funding those costs with other capital. See Note 10 “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional Information regarding the Company and Relief . In July 2021 the Company was granted exclusive worldwide development rights to an investigational COVID-19 vaccine called BriLife™ pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Israel, Ministry of Defense. The Company is commencing a registration trial of the BriLife vaccine in the nations of Georgia, Ukraine, Israel, and additional countries. The Company expects to enter into a long-term royalty-bearing licensing agreement for the commercialization of the vaccine. ​ ​ 2. Liquidity As of September 30, 2021, the Company had $ 38,883,569 in cash. Since inception, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable. The Company is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. On August 23, 2021, the Company completed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) and issued 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $ 11.00 per share and Preferred Investment Options (the “Preferred Investment Options”, and, collectively with the shares of common stock issued under the Private Placement, the “Securities”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $ 12.00 . The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $ 30,000,000 , before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. Accordingly, the Company believes that it currently has sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through the next twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company’s operations. 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COVID-19 Outbreak On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 Outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 Outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. Aside from our COVID-19 related trials, as a result of the COVID-19 Outbreak, most of our other trials have been halted. Except as otherwise discussed in the preceding sentence and otherwise in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes or impact of COVID-19 on our business. However, the full impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak continues to evolve as of the date hereof. If the COVID-19 Outbreak continues, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP (the “Reverse Recapitalization”). Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. NeuroRx was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the following predominant factors: The consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Reverse Recapitalization are those of NeuroRx. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and losses per share, prior to the Merger, have been retroactively restated based on shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Merger. 10 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the valuation of common and preferred stock, stock options, warrants, contingent consideration and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 13) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consist of balances due from collaborative partners. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated, and specific partner issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances. Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Cash is the only financial instrument that is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company’s cash is deposited in accounts at large financial institutions, and amounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company 11 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the cash is held. The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk of loss. Research and Development Costs The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Modification of stock options and warrants A change in any of the terms or conditions of stock options and warrants is accounted for as a modification. For a Type 1 (probable-to-probable) modification, incremental stock-based compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified option/warrant over the fair value of the original option/warrant immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested stock options and warrants to board members, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested stock options, we recognize over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date. If the fair value of the modified option is lower than the fair value of the original option immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award. The accounting for incremental fair value of warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification which may result in a reduction of additional paid-in capital, recognition of costs for services rendered, or recognized as a deemed dividend. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value 12 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS on the date of issuance and remeasured at fair value each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achieving the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period (see Notes 11 and 13). Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, and other dilutive instruments when the effect would be anti-dilutive in the periods. The following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of the diluted net earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stock for the periods in which a net loss is presented because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30, ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, ​ 2021 2020 2021 2020 Stock options 2,388,811 — 2,388,811 1,754,623 Common stock warrants 9,305,790 — 9,305,790 1,690,192 Earnout Shares ​ 22,209,280 ​ — ​ 22,209,280 ​ — Earnout Shares from exercised Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants ​ 1,229,925 ​ — ​ 1,229,925 ​ — ​ Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes: Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . This guidance removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC 740. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major 13 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and it also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and adoption must be as of the beginning of the Company’s annual fiscal year.

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements The Company has restated its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2021, and its condensed consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine month period ended September 30, 2021, along with certain related notes to such restated condensed consolidated financial statements. The errors that caused the Company to conclude that its financial statements should be restated are the result of a misapplication of the guidance on accounting for certain Substitute Warrants, which was identified in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Based on ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity , warrant instruments that do not meet the criteria to be considered indexed to an entity’s own stock shall be initially classified as liabilities at their estimated fair values. In periods subsequent to issuance, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments should be reported in the statement of operations. The Company determined that the condensed consolidated financial statements should be restated to reflect the modification of the Substitute Warrants as a liability, with subsequent changes in their estimated fair value recorded as non-cash income or expense in the statements of operations for all periods since modification on May 24, 2021. In addition to the restatement of the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has also restated the following notes for the three- and nine-month period ended September 30, 2021, to reflect the error corrections noted above. • Note 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies • Note 5 - Reverse Recapitalization • Note 10 - Commitment and Contingencies • Note 11 - Equity • Note 13 – Fair Value Measurements The following table represents the estimated fair value of the Company’s Substitute Warrants liabilities recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet along with changes in fair value which are recorded as other income and expense on our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Reverse Recapitalization As discussed in Note 1, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), BRPA closed the Merger with NeuroRx, as a result of which NeuroRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRPA. While BRPA was the legal acquirer of NeuroRx in the Merger, for accounting purposes, the Merger is treated as a Reverse Recapitalization, whereby NeuroRx is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the historical financial statements of NeuroRx became the historical financial statements of BRPA (renamed NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) upon the closing of the Merger. Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of NeuroRx at the Closing Date consisted of 50,000,000 shares (“Closing Consideration”) of BRPA common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share (“Common Stock”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of NeuroRx common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share, and each share of the NeuroRx convertible preferred stock that was convertible into a share of NeuroRx common stock at a one-to-one ratio pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation, was converted into Common Stock equal to 3.16 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”). In addition, the stockholders of NeuroRx who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time received the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock, including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of outstanding shares of NeuroRx preferred stock was converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (after consideration of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants (as further discussed below). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s stockholders who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time would have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of up to 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”), less 935,608 and 1,920,492, respectively, which are subject to the terms and conditions of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants (each as defined below), if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval 16 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. The Earnout Cash Milestone was recognized as a deemed dividend at the Closing Date and a contingent liability measured at its estimated fair value at the Closing Date and will be remeasured at fair value each period end thereafter until earned or December 31, 2022 (see Note 13). The Earnout Shares Milestone was recognized as a deemed dividend at the Closing date and was classified within equity (see Note 13). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash and Earnout Shares for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and therefore the amount of Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $88,837,121 and 22,209,280 shares, respectively. Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option or warrant to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Substitute Options” and the “Substitute Warrants,” respectively), based on an exchange ratio of 4.96:1 (the “Option Exchange Ratio”), and would continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the original instruments. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be automatically adjusted based on the Merger Agreement such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying such option or warrant had the conversion of the legacy NeuroRx option and warrants into the Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1). If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option and Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held in escrow pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option or warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option or warrant holder. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $ 10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $ 10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date.

Convertible Notes Payable On February 12, 2020, a Qualified Financing Event (as defined below) occurred when the Company received cumulative investment proceeds in excess of $ 10,000,000 from the sale and issuance of common shares. The fair value of the Company’s common shares was $ 10.63 per share. The 2017 Notes (as defined below) and the 2018 Notes (as defined below) in the aggregate principal amount of $ 2,800,000 were converted into 1,005,458 common shares (at the discounted price of $ 2.78 per share), and the related unpaid and accrued interest totaling $ 369,660 were also converted into 132,739 common shares of the Company (at the discounted price of $ 2.78 per share). Additionally, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment for the difference between the carrying value of the convertible notes, unamortized debt discount, and the value of the embedded put option and the fair value of the common shares of $ 0 and $ 306,641 during the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The Company issued the shares of common stock pursuant to this conversion on September 23, 2020. 2017 Convertible Notes Payable On November 16, 2017 and November 19, 2017, the Company issued convertible notes (“2017 Notes”), as amended for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 2,500,000 . The 2017 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 % per annum and principal and interest were due and payable four years from the date of issuance. Upon either a sale of the Company’s assets or all of its capital stock, or a change of control, the principal balance would double and be repaid. Upon closing of either a sale of the Company’s shares for at least $ 10,000,000 or a public offering of the Company’s securities (“Qualified Financing Event”), the outstanding principal balance will be converted into the number of such securities sold at a conversion price equal to 80% of the securities negotiated share price . 2018 Convertible Notes Payable On January 5, 2018 and April 25, 2018, the Company issued convertible notes (“2018 Notes”), as amended for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 300,000 . The 2018 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 % per annum and were due and payable four years from the date of issuance. Upon either a sale of the Company’s assets or all of its capital stock, or a change of control, the principal balance would double and be repaid. Upon closing of a Qualified Financing Event, the outstanding principal balance will be converted into the number of such securities sold at a conversion price equal to 80% of the securities negotiated share price. The proceeds received upon issuing the 2017 Notes and the 2018 Notes were first allocated to the fair value of the embedded put with the remainder to the debt host instrument. The Company recognized a loss of $ 0 and $ 0 during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 0 and $ 27,160 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to the estimated increase in fair value of the embedded put. 19 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt. The Company amortized debt discount of $ 0 to interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and $ 0 and $ 16,475 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company paid no interest during the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. 9. Notes Payable Relief Therapeutics Loan On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Relief (the “Relief Therapeutics Loan”) in the amount of $ 500,000 . The loan matures on April 6, 2022 and bears interest at 2 % per annum payable in arrears. Paycheck Protection Program Loan On April 28, 2020, the Company received $ 119,842 in loan funding from the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”), established pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The unsecured PPP Loan accrues interest on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1 % per annum, and there is a six-month deferment period until equal installment payments of $6,744 of principal and interest are due. The term of the PPP Loan is two years . To the extent the loan amount is not forgiven under the PPP Loan, the Company is obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest, beginning seven months from the date of the PPP Loan note, until the maturity date. The PPP Loan amount may be eligible for forgiveness in the event that (1) at least 75% of the PPP Loan proceeds are used to cover payroll costs and the remainder is used for mortgage interest, rent and utility costs over the eight-week period after the PPP Loan is made, and (2) the number of employees and compensation levels are generally maintained. Forgiveness of the PPP Loan is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the PPP Loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such PPP Loan based on future adherence to the forgiveness criteria. The Company used the entire PPP Loan for qualifying payroll expenses, and filed for loan forgiveness on December 30, 2020. The Company received full forgiveness of all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the PPP Loan as of February 11, 2021. The forgiveness of the PPP Loan qualified for debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments , and as a result, the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was written off in the amount of $ 119,842 and $ 968 , respectively, and the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment totaling $ 120,810 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Note Payable -- Vendor On July 1, 2019, the Company converted certain accounts payable into a loan (the “Note Payable — Vendor”) with a vendor in the amount of $ 154,190 .

During the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals paid NJ Health $ 90,112 and $ 216,269 , respectively, of the total committed amount. Aviptadil Manufacturing, Production, Supply and Distribution Agreements On August 25, 2020, the Company and Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Nephron”) signed an agreement for the manufacturing of finished pharmaceutical product of Aviptadil intravenous formulation and the development of an inhaled (nebulizer) formulation of Aviptadil. Nephron will serve as the exclusive and primary supplier of the product for both clinical and commercial purposes, supplying 100 % of the Company’s annual requirements. The Company has agreed to purchase products from Nephron for a fixed price. On September 29, 2020, the Company and Cardinal Health signed an exclusive distribution agreement, as well as a 3rd party logistics agreement on October 1, 2020. Cardinal Health will manage warehousing, distribution, invoicing for the potential sale of Aviptadil in the United States and Puerto Rico. On October 9, 2020, the Company signed an agreement with PolyPeptide Group, North America for the supply of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) Aviptadil (VIP). This gives NRx Pharmaceuticals a significant reduction in the cost of procuring API. The Company has agreed to purchase a total of $ 5,255,000 worth of product and services, of which $ 1,407,500 has been paid for and recorded as a prepaid asset on the Company’s balance sheet as of September 30, 2021. 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On January 4, 2021, the Company and Aerogen Limited (“Aerogen”) signed a supply agreement for the supply of certain products, including the Aerogen Solo Nebulizer System and Aerogen Ultra, solely for the purposes of carrying out clinical trials relating to inhalation delivery of Aviptadil for treatment of pulmonary insufficiency and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. Pill Tracker Ltd. (PillTracker) is an agent of the Company per the supply agreement (see Note 15) and is managing the supply agreement at the Company’s request. On July 1, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals and BriLife LLC signed an agreement for a Phase II Inhaled clinical trial of Aviptadil in the nation of Georgia with a total cost of approximately $ 7,400,000 . The contract is cancelable with 60 days’ notice. The Phase II Inhaled clinical trial of Aviptadil in the nation of Georgia has not begun and the Company may decide not to proceed with this trial. Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Relief for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The collaboration agreement provides for funding by Relief of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the collaboration agreement. Relief has reimbursed the Company $ 10.9 million for expenses related to COVID-19 but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs of Research and Development, including the IV clinical trial, the inhaled use trial, formulation and manufacture of ZYESAMI (Aviptadil), statistical analysis, and regulatory filings. The financial statements reflect $ 13.8 million in unreimbursed Research and Development costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, prior to the allocation of corporate overhead. Additional unreimbursed costs were reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company advised Relief that the Company is funding those costs with other capital. On October 6, 2021, Relief filed a lawsuit against the Company and its CEO claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the collaboration agreement. Relief’s complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the collaboration agreement. The Company believes the lawsuit is baseless and without merit. However, the parties to the lawsuit have agreed to engage in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation and have agreed to hold a mediation in early January 2022. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute significant counterclaims against Relief. Share Subscription Facility Agreement - GEM NeuroRx previously entered into a share subscription facility agreement (“GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on an Exchange (any nationally recognized stock exchange or exchange platform in the world on which the Company will list its shares), GEM grants NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares from the Company for up to an aggregate value of approximately $ 95.6 million. The agreement also included certain provisions which would not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares thus preventing its usage. If NeuroRx was listed or completes a private transaction which results in a change of control of the Company, NeuroRx would issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $ 1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the agreement. The reverse merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement would not have resulted in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. ​ In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue a warrant to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. The warrant is not conditional upon any further events or completion of the merger. The warrant was issued March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrant”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately partially exercise the warrant for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7,500,018 . The GEM Warrant were valid for a period of 22 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS three years from the date NeuroRx’s stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or consummation of a reverse merger transaction of the type contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a contingent liability for its obligation to issue to GEM certain equity instruments at a discounted per share price. Specifically, as the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability and settlement expense of $39,486,139 to reflect the fair value of the expected GEM Warrant to be issued. On March 28, 2021, when the GEM Warrant was issued, the Company recorded an additional charge of $21,365,641 to reflect the increased fair value of the GEM Warrant on its grant date. Upon issuance, the GEM Warrant was equity classified and was determined to be within the scope of ASC 718, Share-Based Payments (“ASC 718”). NeuroRx was required to register the Initial Exercised Shares on (a) the same registration statement on Form S-4 (or such other registration statement, if changed) in connection with the Merger, or (b) such other registration statement in connection with any other transaction which results in a public listing of NeuroRx. In addition, no later than 90 days following the consummation of the Big Rock merger, the Company was required to file with the SEC a registration statement to register under the Securities Act the resale by GEM of all shares issuable under the GEM Warrant other than the Initial Exercised Shares, which was filed with the Company's S-1 in July 2021. The GEM Warrant also includes “piggyback” registration rights. The GEM Warrants that were not exercised as of the Merger were modified and became Substitute Warrants (1,833,596 shares, adjusted for the Merger as discussed in Note 11). These Substitute Warrants were liability classified (see Note 11). The changes in fair value of these Substitute Warrants were recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of operations until these Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital. 11. Equity Common Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value $ 0.001 . As discussed in Note 5, we have retroactively adjusted the shares issued and outstanding prior to May 24, 2021 to give effect to the Exchange Ratio established in the Merger Agreement to determine the number of shares of common stock into which they were converted. The Company sold 3,238,338 and 3,642,515 shares of common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, generating gross proceeds of $ 31,134,816 and $ 39,624,175 , respectively. Of the 511,065 shares of common stock issued for the exercise of stock options, 185,472 shares of common stock are contingently issuable Earnout Shares and are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for computing EPS until the contingent conditions are satisfied. There are 1,044,453 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the GEM warrants which are contingently issuable Earnout Shares and are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for computing EPS until the contingent conditions are satisfied. The Company issued 2,334,370 and 3,830,586 shares of common stock pursuant to warrants and Unit Purchase Options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, and received gross proceeds from the warrant exercise of $9,199,471 and $16,699,489, respectively. The Company issued 634,045 and 834,045 shares of common stock for consulting services during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, and recognized non-cash consulting expense in general and administrative expenses of $ 7,925,511 and $ 12,775,511 , respectively. The Company sold 292,534 and 343,378 shares of common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, and received gross proceeds of $ 1,412,067 and $ 1,589,092 , respectively. 23 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company issued 1,138,199 shares of common stock to settle the notes conversion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and recorded a loss of $ 306,641 . Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BRPA and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters of BRPA’s initial public offering (“EBC”), entered into an amendment (“BCMA Amendment Agreement”) to the Business Combination Marketing Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2017 (“BCMA”), by and between BRPA and EBC. The BCMA Amendment Agreement provided that, in lieu of the cash fee payable to EBC pursuant to the BCMA, BRPA will issue to EBC at the Effective Time an aggregate of 200,000 shares of Common Stock and the BCMA (as amended by the BCMA Amendment Agreement) will terminate immediately following the Effective Time. The Company recognized the fair value of the 200,000 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the BCMA of $ 4,850,000 within general and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 13 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. Preferred Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value $ 0.001 . Series A, B-1, and B-1A Preferred Stock Prior to the Merger, the Company had authorized and issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, 1,050,695 shares of Series B-1 convertible preferred stock, and 316,848 shares of Series B-1A convertible preferred stock, par value of $ 0.001 per share, which was convertible into one share of common stock for each preferred share (collectively, the “Preferred Stock”) at any time, at the option of the holder. The Preferred Stock were not redeemable and the related stockholders were entitled to a subordinated liquidation preference should NeuroRx liquidate or wind up operations. The preferences also included voting rights on an as-converted basis, ride-along rights, and an anti-dilution provision. The liquidation preference was $ 1.00 per share for the Series A convertible preferred stock, $ 7.58 per share for the Series B-1 convertible preferred stock, and $ 6.82 per share for the Series B-1A convertible preferred stock, plus any declared but unpaid dividends. Upon an initial public offering or merger under certain conditions the Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock. On May 24, 2021, pursuant to the Merger (as described in Note 5), 2,367,543 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock were automatically converted into 7,480,836 shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio. Series B-2 Preferred Stock In 2020, the Company authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “B-2 Preferred Stock”), par value of $ 0.001 per share, convertible into one share of common stock for each share of B-2 Preferred Stock held. In March 2020, 4,167 shares of B-2 Preferred Stock were issued. The B-2 Preferred stock were not redeemable and the related stockholders were entitled to a subordinated liquidation preference should NeuroRx liquidate or wind up operations. The preferences also included voting rights on an as-converted basis, ride-along rights, and an anti-dilution provision. The liquidation preference was $ 12.00 per share plus any declared but unpaid dividends. The B-2 Preferred Stock could be converted into one share of common stock (subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalization) at any time, at the option of the holder. Upon an initial public offering or merger under certain conditions the B-2 Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock. On May 24, 2021, pursuant to the Merger (as described in Note 5), 4,167 outstanding shares of B-2 Preferred stock were automatically converted into 13,168 shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio. 24 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Common Stock Warrants As discussed in Note 10, on March 28, 2021, NeuroRx issued 3,329,812 fully vested common stock warrants, exercisable at a per share price of $3.19 until they expire on March 27, 2024 to GEM. The fair value on the date of issuance was $60,851,779. Upon issuance, 1,496,216 warrants were immediately exercised generating gross proceeds of $7,500,018. As further discussed below, upon the Merger the remaining unexercised GEM Warrants were modified to become Substitute Warrants in July 2021, GEM exercised their Substitute Warrants for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares for gross proceeds of $9,186,316 and the GEM Warrant was extinguished. Substitute Warrants As discussed in Note 5, in connection with the Merger, each warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Warrants, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant. Each Substitute Warrant will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx warrant multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 5, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Warrant that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx warrant that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Warrant had the conversion of NeuroRx warrants into the Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1) as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the warrant holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate 4,909,066 shares of the Company’s common stock with an average exercise price of $ 2.45 per share. With respect to warrants held by certain members of our Board of Directors, the Substitute Warrants were determined to be within the scope of ASC 718. For the portion of the warrants subject to the base Exchange Ratio (3.16:1), the warrants were fully vested and therefore the incremental fair value of these Substitute Warrants at the date of the modification date was immediately recognized as compensation expense. For the incremental portion of the warrants with performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone) the Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at September 30, 2021 and therefore no expense has been recognized for this portion. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize 25 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. The Company recognized incremental compensation on the modification date totaling $2,330,572 which was recognized in General and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for nine months ended September 30, 2021. Unamortized compensation costs related to performance-based vesting conditions of these Substitute Warrants as of the modification date was $23,760,993. For any remaining outstanding warrants, as the warrant holders were no longer providing services at the date of the modification, in accordance with ASC 815, the Company concluded that the provisions in the Merger Agreement related to the Earnout Shares Milestone and the Earnout Cash Milestone and the contingent right to receive additional shares for these provisions precluded these the Substitute Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Substitute Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Substitute Warrants should be recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Merger) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, with changes in fair value recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period of change. On May 24, 2021, the Company recorded a warrant liability of $53,337,336 for the Substitute Warrants, reclassified out of additional paid-in capital $38,220,448 representing fair value of these NeuroRx warrants, immediately before the modifications as a result of the Merger, and recognized a loss of $15,116,888 for the incremental fair value of these Substitute Warrants which is recorded in the Change in fair value of warrant liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company recognized a loss on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 of $16,276,232 and $0, respectively. The Company recognized a loss on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 of $385,873 and $0, respectively. Refer to Note 13 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. As discussed above the GEM Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, and changes in fair value of the warrant liability through the date of exercise were recognized in the statement of operations and upon exercise any remaining instruments were reclassified to additional paid-in capital and includes associated escrow shares for the contingent earnouts. The fair value of the original NeuroRx warrants and Substitute Warrants as of the Merger Date was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Warrants Substitute Warrants Strike price ​ ​ $7.58-$15.84 ​ ​ $1.53-$3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0% ​ 80.0% ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.03%-0.32% ​ 0.03%-0.32% ​ Expected term ​ 0.57-3.69 ​ 0.57-3.69 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 3,450,000 Public Warrants. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the Effective Time and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: 26 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Certain of the above conditions have not been met to redeem the Public Warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, 1,144 Public Warrants were exercised for gross proceeds of $ 13,156 . Assumed Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Placement Warrants. The Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021. The Company measures the fair value of the warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s operating results for the current period. The Company recognized a loss on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 of $260,238 and $ 0 , respectively. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 of $1,208,412 and $ 0 , respectively. Refer to Note 13 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. 27 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one Public Right and one-half of one Public Warrant. Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon exercise of the Units. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from November 20, 2017. The option grants to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years , respectively, from the effective date of the Company's registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. On July 23, 2021, the outstanding 600,000 Units were converted on a cashless basis into 499,630 shares of the Company’s common stock. Conversion of Rights Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 6,900,000 and 272,500 Public Rights and Placement Rights, respectively. At the Effective Time, each holder of a right received one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock at the Effective Time, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with the Merger, resulting in the issuance of 717,250 shares of Common Stock to holders of such rights. No fractional shares were issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration was paid at the Effective Time, as the consideration related thereto had been included in the original unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Company's Initial Public Offering or the concurrent private placement, as applicable. ​ August 2021 Private Placement 28 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On August 23, 2021, the Company completed a Private Placement and issued 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $ 11.00 per share and the Preferred Investment Options (warrants) to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $ 12.00 per share until they expire on August 23, 2024. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $ 30.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. In connection with the Private Placement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the purchasers of the Securities. The Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 to register the Securities became effective on September 15, 2021. Transaction costs incurred related to the Private Placement include the following: (i) placement fees of $ 2,250,000 (ii) issuance of Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent to purchase up to an aggregate of 136,364 shares with an exercise price of $ 13.75 per share and a three-year term with a fair value of $ 1,026,957 , and (iii) legal, professional and printing fees of $ 391,781 . Preferred Investment Options (included in above warrants table) The form of the Preferred Investment Option is a warrant. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 13.78 , exercise price of $ 12.00 , term of three years , volatility of 85.9 %, risk-free rate of 0.43 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). The grant date fair value of these Preferred Investment Options was estimated to be $ 21,695,457 on August 23, 2021 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of September 30, 2021. As noted above, the Company issued fully vested Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent with an exercise price of $ 13.75 . As these Preferred Investment Options were issued for services provided in facilitating the Private Placement, the Company recorded the fair value of such Preferred Investment Options as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 13.78 , exercise price of $ 13.75 , term of three years , volatility of 85.9 %, risk-free rate of 0.43 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). ​ 12. Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that was subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former option. Each Substitute Option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 5, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Option that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx option that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. 29 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Option had the conversion of NeuroRx options into the Substitute Options been applied using the Exchange Ratio as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. As stated in the Merger Agreement, if any Substitute Options are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 5.10 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Options as a modification of the existing options. Incremental compensation costs, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified options over the fair value of the original options immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx options and Substitute Options was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Options Substitute Options ​ Strike price ​ ​ $ 1.00 -$ 72.30 ​ ​ $ 0.20 -$ 14.58 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ The Substitute Options contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at September 30, 2021. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Options subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. For vested Substitute Options, the Company recognized incremental compensation on the modification date totaling $ 1,014,640 of which $ 993,500 and $ 21,140 was recognized in General and Administrative and Research and Development, respectively, in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. For unvested Substitute Options, the Company will recognize incremental compensation over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date, taking into consideration the probability of the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone. Incremental compensation costs related to unvested Substitute Options as of the modification date was $ 25,877,473 . 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan At the Effective Time, the Company adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of September 30, 2021, 5,373,049 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan, inclusive of any shares of Common Stock subject to stock options, restricted stock awards or other awards that were assumed in the 30 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Merger and terminate as a result of being unexercised or are forfeited or repurchased by the Company, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2021 Plan equal to 5,373,049 shares of Common Stock. The Substitute Options do not reduce the number of shares authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan. As of September 30, 2021, 732,460 shares have been awarded and 4,640,589 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for settlement and services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying value of notes payable approximated the estimated fair values due to their recent issuances. 32 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and Earnout Cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements. The following table presents information about the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Description Level September 30, 2021 (As restated) December 31, 2020 Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Warrant liabilities (Note 11) ​ 3 ​ $ 1,261,550 ​ $ — Earnout Cash liability (Note 5) 3 ​ $ 26,283,238 ​ $ — ​ Warrant liabilities The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value the Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The Company uses a modified Black-Scholes model approach for the Substitute Warrants which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black Scholes options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical and peer company volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. The significant inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, 2021 At Effective Time ​ ​ (As restated) ​ Expected life ​ 1.77 - 4.65 ​ 0.3 - 5.0 ​ Volatility ​ 82.5% - 85.9% ​ 39.0% - 80.0% ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.15% - 0.32% ​ 0.03% - 0.82% ​ Dividend yield ​ — % — % Fair value of warrants ​ ​ $4.26 - $7.40 ​ ​ $14.56 - $22.72 ​ ​ A reconciliation of warrant liabilities is included below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value (As restated) Balance as of December 31, 2020 ​ $ — Additions pursuant to Merger ​ 40,204,122 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ( 17,359,009 ) Balance as of June 30, 2021 ​ ​ 22,845,113 Loss upon re-measurement ​ ​ 16,536,469 Reclassification to additional paid-in capital upon exercise ​ ​ (38,120,032) Balance as of September 30, 2021 ​ $ 1,261,550 ​ Earnout Cash liability 33 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market, including the probability of achievement, and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. A reconciliation of the Earnout Cash liability is included below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2020 ​ $ — Additions pursuant to Merger ​ 25,520,195 Loss upon re-measurement ​ 354,701 Balance as of June 30, 2021 ​ ​ 25,874,896 Loss upon re-measurement ​ ​ 408,342 Balance as of September 30, 2021 ​ $ 26,283,238 ​ Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares has been estimated using the trading price of our Common Stock at the Effective Time ($ 24.25 ), discounted based on the probability of the Earnout Shares Milestone being met as determined at the Effective Time, and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The contingent Earnout Shares, if achieved, would be issued to legacy NeuroRx shareholders. The Earnout Shares are a fixed number of shares to be issued to such shareholders on a pro rata basis. The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares was recognized as a deemed dividend. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares was $ 255,822,071 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $ 0 ). 14. Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the CARES Act to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, and modification to the net interest deduction limitations. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The Company continues to monitor any effects on its financial statements that may result from the CARES Act. Upon consummation of the Merger, a change in control was deemed to have occurred and the Company's net operating loss carrybacks could be subject to limitations. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of September 30, 2021. 34 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition and plan of operations together with NRx Pharmaceuticals' unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (""BRPA""), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (“Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. ​ NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing NRX-101, the first investigational oral therapeutic for the treatment of Acute Suicidal Behavior/Ideation (ASIB) in Bipolar Disorder and Aviptadil (reformulated as ZYESAMI ® ), an investigational intravenous and inhaled drug to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19. The NRx Pharmaceuticals Antidepressant Regime was developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Prof. Daniel Javitt, PhD, MD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRx Pharmaceuticals Antidepressant Regime begins with a single dose of ketamine, an FDA approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed and investigated as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for acute suicidal crisis associated with bipolar depression. NRX-101 combines DCS, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from multiple Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a Phase 2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on the STABIL-B study ( www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the current standard of care) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. In March 2020, the Company initiated development of RLF-100 ZYESAMI in partnership with Relief Therapeutics through a collaboration agreement (“Relief Agreement”). ZYESAMI is based on 50 years of research, pioneered by Professor Sami Said, on the role of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide in preventing and treating acute lung injury by protecting the Type II cell in the lung. The rights to Dr. Said’s scientific work are licensed by the Company from the Research Foundation of the State University of New York. On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Relief for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The collaboration agreement provides for funding by Relief of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the collaboration agreement. Relief has reimbursed the Company approximately $10.9 million for expenses but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs of the IV clinical trial, the inhaled use trial, formulation and manufacture of ZYESAMI, statistical analysis, and regulatory 37 Table of Contents filings. The financial statements reflect $13.8 million in unreimbursed Research and Development costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, prior to the allocation of corporate overhead. Additional unreimbursed costs were reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company advised Relief that the Company is funding those costs with other capital. On October 6, 2021, Relief filed a lawsuit against the Company. See Contractual Obligations and Commitments below. In an open-label, single center trial at Houston Methodist Hospital, ZYESAMI demonstrated a statistically significant 9-fold advantage in probability of survival and recovery from respiratory failure compared to the standard of care among patients with COVID-19 Respiratory Failure. On June 1, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals reported phase IIb/III study results of ZYESAMI in patients with respiratory failure due to critical COVID-19. The study failed to meet its primary endpoint of being alive and free of respiratory failure at day 60 without controlling for ventilation status or site of care (i.e. tertiary care hospital vs. community hospital), but did demonstrate a statistically significant increase in the likelihood that patients treated with ZYESAMI would be alive and free of respiratory failure at 60 days, compared to those treated with placebo when controlling for ventilation status and site of care. The clinical study did demonstrate a 2-fold, statistically-significant increased odds of surviving COVID-19 respiratory failure across all patients and sites of care when controlling for baseline severity of COVID-19 in each patient. This survival endpoint was a declared secondary endpoint of the clinical trial. In November 2021, the FDA declined the Company’s application for Emergency Use Authorization for ZYESAMI. The Company continues to provide the FDA with new data from ongoing trials as such data become available and the FDA has stated that it remains committed to working with the Company on the development of ZYESAMI. ​ The Company expects to file a new drug application (NDA) based on the recently completed Phase 2b/3 clinical trial and additional clinical trials currently underway, including the National Institutes of Health ACTIV3b/TESICO trial (NCT 04843761). The Company plans to file for accelerated approval of ZYESAMI based on the IL-6 and RDR data in the two clinical studies. If granted approval, ZYESAMI would be the first medicine in the United States indicated specifically for patients suffering from critical COVID-19 with respiratory failure. In July 2021, the nation of Georgia issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for intravenous ZYESAMI (Aviptadil) for the treatment of critical COVID-19. Pursuant to this EUA, the Company has sent a team of physicians to Georgia to train local doctors to appropriately administer ZYESAMI and the effects of the medicine. The supply of intravenous doses by the Company is being discussed with the Georgia Ministry of Health and with the Ministries of Health of other nations in the Caucasus region. On October 8, 2021, the Company submitted an updated manufacturing module to its FDA Investigational New Drug file documenting this change in manufacture and stability. On November 8, 2021, the FDA communicated with the Company that the manufacturing update had been reviewed and that no “clinical hold” items had been identified (this is the regulatory language that allows an investigational product to be given to patients). The Company initiated a parallel manufacturing process to conform to EU and UK standards. In October 2021, the Company announced that a European Qualified Person audit was conducted and no major deficiencies were identified, thus clearing ZYESAMI’s use in EU investigational programs. Although the initial focus has been on the use of intravenous ZYESAMI, the Company has received permission from the FDA to test inhaled ZYESAMI in a phase 2/3 clinical trial for patients with early COVID-19 disease. The Company believes that the inhaled medicine will be more convenient for patients to self-administer than the intravenous drug, provided patients are still able to inhale normally and do not have inflammatory debris clogging the alveoli. This clinical trial commenced in January 2021 and is expected to conclude in the first half of 2022. On July 11, 2021, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Israel. The MoU allows for the Company to hold an exclusive, worldwide license to develop the BriLife TM vaccine, a novel COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR). The vaccine is a self-propagating live virus vaccine based on World Health Organization sponsored research that resulted in the development of a successful vaccine against Ebola. The vaccine has demonstrated a statistically significant increase in COVID-neutralizing antibody (a sign of immunity to SARS-CoV-2) compared to placebo in phase 2a trials conducted in Israel. The vaccine has further shown indications of neutralizing antibody against variants of concern, including the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 38 Table of Contents early human and preclinical studies. The Company is commencing a registration trial of the vaccine in the nations of Georgia, Ukraine, Israel and additional countries. The IIBR will provide technical assistance for the clinical trial. The Company has contracted with a GMP Viral Vector manufacturing partner to scale up the vaccine manufacturing. If the BriLife clinical trials are successful, and subject to the negotiation of definitive licensing agreements with the IIBR, the Company would have an exclusive license to commercialize the vaccine in exchange for agreed upon milestone and royalty payments. Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $37,049,331 and $5,161,712, respectively.

COVID-19 Outbreak On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 Outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 Outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. Aside from our COVID-19 related trials, as a result of the COVID-19 Outbreak most of our other trials have been halted. Except as otherwise discussed in the preceding sentence and otherwise in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes or impact of COVID-19 on our business. However, the full impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak continues to evolve as of the date hereof. If the COVID-19 Outbreak continues, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. ​ Components of Results of Operations Operating expenses Research and development expenses NRx Pharmaceuticals’ research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with NRx Pharmaceuticals’ clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and equity-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts.

Until such time as NRx Pharmaceuticals is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of ZYESAMI will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations. Reverse Recapitalization Merger and Subsequent Equity Issuances Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. At September 30, 2021, the fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated to be $26,283,238. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $255,822,071 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $0). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $88,837,121. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date. The Company received $8,100,000 in net proceeds after transaction costs. NRx Pharmaceuticals expects to continue to incur operating losses and net cash outflows until such time as it generates a level of revenue from sale or licensing of drug products to support its cost structure. There is no assurance that NRx Pharmaceuticals will achieve profitable operations and if achieved, whether it will be sustained on a continued basis. NRx Pharmaceuticals intends to fund ongoing activities by raising additional capital through equity or debt financings. There can be no assurance that NRx Pharmaceuticals will be successful in raising that additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to NRx Pharmaceuticals. If NRx Pharmaceuticals is unable to raise 43 Table of Contents sufficient additional capital, NRx Pharmaceuticals may be compelled to reduce the scope of its operations and planned capital expenditures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements NRx Pharmaceuticals is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. NRx Pharmaceuticals has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates NRx Pharmaceuticals' management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the valuation of conversion features of convertible notes and common stock, the valuation of stock options and warrants and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. Fair value of common and preferred stock Prior to the Merger, in order to determine the fair value of shares of its common stock, the Company's board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of its common stock and preferred stock based on arms-length transactions with third party investors. Subsequent to the Merger, the Board determines the fair value of the Common Stock based on the closing market price on the date of grant. 45 Table of Contents Share-based compensation Our stock-based awards are classified as equity (stock options and warrants). We recognize related share-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the awards. We estimate the fair value of all stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model which requires the use of subjective assumptions that could materially impact the estimation of fair value and related compensation expense to be recognized. One of these assumptions include the expected volatility of our stock price. Developing this assumption requires the use of judgment. The Company, both prior to and after the Merger, lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. We also estimate the fair value of our common stock based on third party sales of our common stock Warrant liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance or date of modification, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the Earnout Cash Milestone and Earnout Shares Milestone probabilities of achievement at each reporting period. Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market, including probability of achievement, and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. This liability is most sensitive to change based on progress of clinical trials, results of such trials, ability to complete the patent application process, assessment of likelihood of approval from the FDA and United States Patent Office, and remaining time to December 31, 2022. ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (“certifying officers”) have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of June 30, 2021. Our certifying officers concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2021. 46 Table of Contents ​ Per Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. ​ Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. The material weakness was due to ineffective risk assessment related to review procedures for complex transactions. This led to a deficiency in the design and implementation of appropriate review controls for complex warrant transactions. The material weakness resulted in a restatement of its financial statements to reclassify the Company’s Substitute Warrants as described in the Explanatory Note to this Quarterly Report. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ In light of the restatement of our financial statements included in this amendment, we plan to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Management is in the process of implementing remediation procedures to address the control deficiency that led to the material weakness. The remediation plan included, but is not limited to, the implementation of additional review procedures regarding the method for accounting for warrants issued in connection with an equity transaction. ​ ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. On October 6, 2021, Relief filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. Relief’s complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. We believe that the claims are baseless and without merit. However, the parties to the lawsuit have agreed to engage in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation and have agreed to hold a mediation in early January 2022. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute significant counterclaims against Relief. We may become involved in various legal actions incidental to our business. As of the date of this report, we are not involved in any other legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Relief Therapeutics has filed a complaint against us regarding the implementation of our Collaboration Agreement. 47 Table of Contents We entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Relief (the “Collaboration Agreement”) on September 18, 2020. The Collaboration Agreement provided that Relief had the right to fund development costs related to Aviptadil for respiratory diseases in exchange for a predetermined division of profits and we had the right to continue its development program with other investor funds should Relief not provide funding. Shortly following the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, however, a number of disputes arose between Relief and the Company, including with respect to the scope of clinical trials of Aviptadil for treatment of COVID-19 respiratory failure and the stability of the original formulation for Aviptadil. In February 2021, Relief ceased funding further development of Aviptadil for treatment of COVID-19 and has refused to fund clinical trials for its inhaled use. Furthermore, Relief has not funded the cost of reformulation necessary to develop a shelf stable product (reformulation as ZYESAMI). On October 6, 2021, Relief filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming that we failed to honor our obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. Relief’s complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. We believe that the claims are baseless and without merit. However, the parties to the lawsuit have agreed to engage in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation and have agreed to hold a mediation in early January 2022. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute significant counterclaims against Relief. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully resolve the dispute through mediation or that, in the event the dispute continues in litigation, that we will be successful in our opposition to Relief’s claims. In the event of an adverse ruling, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to pay damages in an amount that may have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects. We are no longer a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules of Nasdaq. However, during the applicable phase-in periods we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance standards, which limit the presence of independent directors on our Board of Directors or committees of the Board of Directors. Previously, Jonathan Javitt and Daniel Javitt controlled the votes of the majority of our common stock. As a result, we were a “controlled company” for purposes of the Nasdaq corporate governance rules and were exempt from certain governance requirements otherwise required by Nasdaq, including requirements that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities. ​ We are no longer a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules of Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq listing requirements, a company that ceases to be a “controlled company” must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees no later than the following phase-in schedule: (1) one independent committee member at the time it ceases to be a controlled company, (2) a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of the date it ceases to be a controlled company and (3) all independent committee members within one year of the date it ceases to be a controlled company. Additionally, the Nasdaq listing requirements provide a 12-month phase-in period from the date a company ceases to be a “controlled company” to comply with the majority independent board requirement. At this time, the majority of our directors are independent, as are a majority of the members of each of our committees while the nominating and corporate governance committee is not made up solely of independent directors. Until we are fully subject to these requirements, however, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq. ​ Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock On July 12, 2021, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-257438) was declared effective (“Registration Statement”). We filed the Registration Statement to permit certain holders of the shares of our Common Stock to resell such shares (the “Selling Securityholders”). We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Securityholders. We also registered the issuance of an aggregate of 3,586,250 shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. We will receive the proceeds from any exercise of warrants for cash. We intend to use the proceeds from the exercise of warrants for cash for general corporate, funding of clinical trial programs and working capital purposes. 48 Table of Contents On August 23, 2021, the Company completed a Private Placement and issued 2,727,273 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of $11.00 per share and the Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $12.00 per share until they expire on August 23, 2024. (collectively, the “Securities”) The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $30,000,000, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. In connection with the Private Placement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the purchasers of the Securities. The Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 to register the Securities was declared effective on September 15, 2021. Item 5. Other Information. None. ​ ​ 49 Table of Contents Item 6.

(the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021 (this “Quarterly Report”) to amend and restate certain items in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021 originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 16, 2021 (the “Original Quarterly Report”). The Original Quarterly Report should no longer be relied upon due to insufficient review procedures related to complex warrant transactions. Background of Restatement In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, we determined the accounting for contingent features of substitute warrants issued in connection with the May 24, 2021 Merger Agreement (the “Merger”) between Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”) and NeuroRx, Inc. (“NeuroRx”), that resulted in NeuroRx becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRPA which was subsequently renamed NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as reported in our previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as of and for the periods ended June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021 (collectively the “Affected Periods”) was incorrect. The error had no impact on our cash balances or operating cash flows for the Affected Periods. The error did not have a material impact on the Company's annual consolidated financial statements included in its 2021 Form 10-K. ​ Certain substitute warrants were equity-classified at the time of the Merger. Rather, they should have been recognized at fair value as a liability-classified derivative instrument as of the date of the Merger. The impact of the error on our condensed consolidated statements of operations is approximately: (i) a $15.9 million reduction in the net loss from $16.0 million to $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and from approximately $41.5 million to $25.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and (ii) an increase in the net loss of approximately $16.3 million from approximately $20.8 million to $37.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and approximately $0.4 million from approximately $62.3 million to $62.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The impact of the error on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement financial position as of June 30, 2021 is an increase to warrant liabilities of approximately $22.3 million, a decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $38.2 million and a decrease in accumulated deficit of approximately $15.9 million. The impact of the error on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement financial position as of September 30, 2021 is an increase to warrant liabilities of approximately $0.5 million, a decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $0.1 million and an increase in accumulated deficit of approximately $0.4 million. ​ Internal Control Considerations For a discussion of management’s consideration of our disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls over financial reporting, and the material weakness identified, see Part I, Item 4, “Controls and Procedures” of this Amended Form 10-Q/A. ​ ​ ​ ​ Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ ​ Page PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION ​ ITEM 1.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021, we consummated the business combination, or the Business Combination, contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), Big Rock Merger Corp., and a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Big Rock Merger Corp. was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (“Merger”). As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name to NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company”), with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Company is a clinical-stage small molecule pharmaceutical company which develops novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and life-threatening pulmonary diseases through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. On September 21, 2020, we announced a commercial partnership with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief”) for global commercialization of RLF-100 (aviptadil acetate) (now reformulated as ZYESAMI TM ), an FDA Fast Track-designated, investigational, pre-commercial drug for COVID-19 related respiratory failure (the “NRx COVID-19 Drug”). The partnership affords Relief the right to fund all formulations and clinical development of aviptadil for treatment of respiratory disease, in exchange for a predetermined share of profits. An application for emergency use authorization (“EUA”) for this product candidate is pending before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In addition, ZYESAMI TM has received EUA in the nation of Georgia. We are also developing NRX-100/101, an FDA Breakthrough Therapy-designated, investigational, pre-commercial drug for treating bipolar depression in patients with acute suicidal ideation and behavior (the “NRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen”). The Company has been granted exclusive worldwide development rights to a new potential COVID-19 vaccine called BriLife pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Israel. The Company is commencing a clinical trial of the BriLife vaccine in the nation of Georgia. If the Georgia clinical trial, and other clinical trials running in Israel are successful, the Company expects to enter into a long-term royalty-bearing licensing agreement for the commercialization of the vaccine. 2. Liquidity As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $ 13,386,332 in cash. Since inception the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable. The Company is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. The Company has a collaboration agreement with Relief which provided for funding by Relief of certain research and development expenses related to the U.S. development of ZYESAMI TM and the portion of corporate overhead attributable to that program. The proceeds received amounted to $ 771,244 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, Relief has declined to reimburse the Company for any additional expenses related to the IV clinical trials for the ZYESAMI TM . The IV clinical trials for the ZYESAMI TM were completed on February 24, 2021. Subsequent to June 30, 2021, the Company received $ 9,186,316 from the exercise of a warrant for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares of common stock. Accordingly, the Company believes that it currently has sufficient funds to support operations through the next twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company’s operations. 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COVID-19 Outbreak On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 Outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 Outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. If the COVID-19 Outbreak continues, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2021 and beyond. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 Outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the year ending December 31, 2021 and beyond. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the balances and results for the periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. The merger between Merger Sub and NeuroRx was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the “Reverse Recapitalization”). Under this method of accounting, BRPA was treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. NeuroRx was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the following predominant factors: The consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Reverse Recapitalization are those of NeuroRx. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and losses per share, prior to the Merger, have been retroactively restated based on shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Merger. 10 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the valuation of common and preferred stock, stock options, warrants, contingent consideration and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 13) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consist of balances due from collaborative partners. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated, and specific partner issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 5,470,897 as the Company does not expect to collect on amounts due to the Company owed from Relief. 11 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Cash is the only financial instrument that is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company’s cash is deposited in accounts at large financial institutions, and amounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the cash is held. The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk of loss. Research and Development Costs The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Modification of stock options and warrants A change in any of the terms or conditions of stock options and warrants is accounted for as a modification. For a Type 1 (probable-to-probable) modification, incremental stock-based compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified option over the fair value of the original option/warrant immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested stock options and warrants to board members, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested stock options, we recognize over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date. If the fair value of the modified option is lower than the fair value of the original option immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award. The accounting for incremental fair value of warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification which may result in a reduction of additional paid-in capital, recognition of costs for services rendered, or recognized as a deemed dividend. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which 12 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured at fair value each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achieving the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period (see Notes 11 and 13). Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, and other dilutive instruments when their effect would be anti-dilutive in the respective periods. ​ 13 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

This guidance removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC 740. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after 14 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and it also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and adoption must be as of the beginning of the Company’s annual fiscal year. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption. In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchange of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options , which provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as (1) an adjustment to equity and, if so, the related earnings per share (EPS) effects, if any, or (2) an expense and, if so, the manner and pattern of recognition. The amendments in this ASU are effective January 1, 2022, including interim periods. Early adoption is permitted.

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements ​ The Company has restated its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2021, and its condensed consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021, and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, along with certain related notes to such restated condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ The errors that caused the Company to conclude that its financial statements should be restated are the result of a misapplication of the guidance on accounting for certain Substitute Warrants, which was identified in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. ​ Based on ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity , warrant instruments that do not meet the criteria to be considered indexed to an entity’s own stock shall be initially classified as liabilities at their estimated fair values. In periods subsequent to issuance, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments should be reported in the statement of operations. The Company determined that the condensed consolidated financial statements should be restated to reflect the modification of the Substitute Warrants as a liability, with subsequent changes in their estimated fair value recorded as non-cash income or expense in the statements of operations for all periods since modification on May 24, 2021. In addition to the restatement of the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has also restated the following notes for the three- and six-month period ended June 30, 2021, to reflect the error corrections noted above. • Note 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies • Note 5 - Reverse Recapitalization • Note 10 - Commitment and Contingencies • Note 11 - Equity • Note 13 – Fair Value Measurements 15 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Reverse Recapitalization As discussed in Note 1, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), BRPA closed the Business Combination with NeuroRx, as a result of which NeuroRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRPA. While BRPA was the legal acquirer of NeuroRx in the business combination, for accounting purposes, the Merger is treated as a Reverse Recapitalization, whereby NeuroRx is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the historical financial statements of NeuroRx became the historical financial statements of BRPA (renamed NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) upon the closing of the Merger. Under this method of accounting, BRPA was treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of NeuroRx at the Closing Date consisted of 50,000,000 shares (“Closing Consideration”) of BRPA common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share (“Common Stock”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of NeuroRx common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share, and each share of the NeuroRx convertible preferred stock that was convertible into a share of NeuroRx common stock at a one-to-one ratio pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation, was converted into Common Stock equal to 3.16 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”). In addition, the stockholders of NeuroRx who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time received the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock, including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of outstanding shares of NeuroRx preferred stock was converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash after consideration of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants (as further discussed below). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s stockholders who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time would have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of up to 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”), less 935,608 and 1,920,492 , respectively, which are subject to the terms and conditions of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants (each as defined below), if, prior to December 17 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $ 100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. The Earnout Cash Milestone was recognized as a deemed dividend at the Closing Date and a contingent liability measured at its estimated fair value at the Closing Date and will be remeasured at fair value each period end thereafter until earned or December 31, 2022 (see Note 13). The Earnout Shares Milestone was recognized as a deemed dividend at the Closing date and was classified within equity (see Note 13). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash and Earnout Shares for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and therefore the amount of Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $88,837,121 and 22,209,280 shares, respectively. ​ Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option or warrant to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Substitute Options” and the “Substitute Warrants,” respectively), based on an exchange ratio of 4.96:1 (the “Option Exchange Ratio”), and would continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the original instruments. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be automatically adjusted based on the Merger Agreement such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying such option or warrant had the conversion of the legacy NeuroRx option and warrants into the Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1). If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option and Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held in escrow pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option or warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option or warrant holder. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $ 10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $ 10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date. 18 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

The 2017 Notes (as defined below) and the 2018 Notes (as defined below) in the aggregate principal amount of $ 2,800,000 were converted into 1,005,458 common shares (at the discounted price of $ 2.78 per share), and the related unpaid and accrued interest totaling $ 369,660 were also converted into 132,739 common shares of the Company (at the discounted price of $ 2.78 per share). Additionally, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment for the difference between the carrying value of the convertible notes, unamortized debt discount, and the value of the embedded put option and the fair value of the common shares of $ 0 and $ 306,641 during the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The Company issued the shares of common stock pursuant to this conversion on September 23, 2020. 2017 Convertible Notes Payable On November 16, 2017 and November 19, 2017, the Company issued convertible notes (“2017 Notes”), as amended for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 2,500,000 . The 2017 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 % per annum and principal and interest were due and payable four years from the date of issuance. Upon either a sale of the Company’s assets or all of its capital stock, or a change of control, the principal balance would double and be repaid. Upon closing of either a sale of the Company’s shares for at least $ 10,000,000 or a public offering of the Company’s securities (“Qualified Financing Event”), the outstanding principal balance will be converted into the number of such securities sold at a conversion price equal to 80% of the securities negotiated share price . 20 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018 Convertible Notes Payable On January 5, 2018 and April 25, 2018, the Company issued convertible notes (“2018 Notes”), as amended for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 300,000 . The 2018 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 % per annum and were due and payable four years from the date of issuance. Upon either a sale of the Company’s assets or all of its capital stock, or a change of control, the principal balance would double and be repaid. Upon closing of either a sale of the Company’s shares for at least $ 10,000,000 or a public offering of the Company’s securities (“Qualified Financing Event”), the outstanding principal balance will be converted into the number of such securities sold at a conversion price equal to 80% of the securities negotiated share price. The proceeds received upon issuing the 2017 Notes and 2018 Notes were first allocated to the fair value of the embedded put with the remainder to the debt host instrument. The Company recognized a loss of $ 0 and $ 0 during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 0 and $ 27,160 during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to the estimated increase in fair value of the embedded put. The discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt. The Company amortized debt discount of $ 0 to interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and $ 0 and $ 16,454 during the six months ended June 30,2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company paid no interest during the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 9. Notes Payable Note Payable -- Related Party On July 1, 2019, the Company converted certain accounts payable into a loan (the “Note Payable — Related Party”) with a related party in the amount of $ 154,190 . The loan, in the form of a promissory note, matures on July 1, 2020. The principal amount of the loan and any accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and payable beginning July 1, 2019. All payments shall be applied first to accrued but unpaid interest, and then to outstanding principal. If not sooner paid, the entire remaining indebtedness (including accrued interest) shall be due and payable on July 1, 2020. The loan bears interest, compounded daily, at 6 % annual interest. The loan continues to accrue interest as it was not paid off upon maturity. Relief Therapeutics Loan On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Relief Therapeutics (the “Relief Therapeutics Loan”) in the amount of $ 500,000 . The loan matures on April 6, 2022 and bears interest at 2 % per annum payable in arrears. Paycheck Protection Program Loan On April 28, 2020, the Company received $ 119,842 in loan funding from the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”), established pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The unsecured PPP Loan accrues interest on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1 % per annum, and there is a six-month deferment period until equal installment payments of $6,744 of principal and interest are due. The term of the PPP Loan is two years . To the extent the loan amount is not forgiven under the PPP, the Company is obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest, beginning seven months from the date of the Note, until the maturity date. The Loan amount may be eligible for forgiveness pursuant to (1) at least 75% of the loan proceeds are used to cover payroll costs and the remainder is used for mortgage interest, rent and utility costs over the eight-week period after the loan is made, and (2) the number of employees and compensation levels are generally maintained. Forgiveness of the loan is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on future adherence to the forgiveness criteria. The Company used the entire PPP Loan for qualifying payroll expenses, and filed for loan forgiveness on December 30, 2020. 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company received full forgiveness of all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the PPP Loan as of February 11, 2021. The forgiveness of the PPP Loan qualified for debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments , and as a result, the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was written off in the amount of $ 119,842 and $ 968 , respectively, and the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment totaling $ 120,810 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The following table summarizes the Company's outstanding notes payable as of the respective periods. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, December 31, ​ ​ 2021 ​ 2020 ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ Note Payable — Related Party ​ $ 154,190 ​ $ 154,190 Relief Therapeutics Loan ​ 500,000 ​ 500,000 Paycheck Protection Program Loan ​ — ​ 119,842 Carrying value of notes payable ​ 654,190 ​ 774,032 Accrued interest ​ ​ 31,976 ​ ​ 22,656 Note payable ​ ​ 686,166 ​ ​ 796,688 Notes payable and accrued interest, current ​ $ 173,694 ​ $ 248,861 Notes payable and accrued interest, non-current ​ $ 512,472 ​ $ 547,827 ​ ​ 10. Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease The Company leases office space on a month-to-month basis. The rent expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $ 48,776 and $ 9,087 , respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $ 55,393 and $ 17,902 , respectively. Sponsored Research Agreement with National Jewish Health On February 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“Research Agreement”) with National Jewish Health (“NJ Health”), a Colorado not-for-profit institution. Under the terms of the Research Agreement, NRx Pharmaceuticals agreed to sponsor a research study at NJ Health relating to the impact of NRx Pharmaceuticals' Aviptadil on propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in alveolar type II cells in vitro (the “Study”). In return for performance of the Study under the Research Agreement, NRx Pharmaceuticals has committed to pay NJ Health approximately $ 360,450 . During the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals paid NJ Health $ 0 and $ 126,157 , respectively, of the total committed amount. Aviptadil Manufacturing, Production, Supply and Distribution Agreements On August 25, 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals and Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Nephron”) signed an agreement for the manufacturing of finished pharmaceutical product of Aviptadil intravenous formulation and the development of an inhaled (nebulizer) formulation of Aviptadil. Nephron will serve as the exclusive and primary supplier of the product for both clinical and commercial purposes, supplying 100 % of the Company’s annual requirements. The Company has agreed to purchase products from Nephron for a fixed price. On September 29, 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals and Cardinal Health signed an exclusive distribution agreement, as well as a 3rd party logistics agreement on October 1, 2020. Cardinal Health will manage warehousing, distribution, invoicing for the potential sale of Aviptadil in the United States and Puerto Rico. 22 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On October 9, 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals signed an agreement with Polypeptide for the supply of GMP grade Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) Aviptadil (VIP). This gives NRx Pharmaceuticals a second source of procuring API. The Company has agreed to purchase a total of $ 1,010,000 worth of product and services over the contract. On January 4, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals and Aerogen Limited (“Aerogen”) signed a supply agreement for the supply of certain products, including the Aerogen Solo Nebulizer System and Aerogen Ultra, solely for the purposes of carrying out clinical trials relating to inhalation delivery of Aviptadil for treatment of pulmonary insufficiency and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. Pill Tracker is an agent of NRx Pharmaceuticals per the supply agreement (see Note 15). Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Relief for the clinical development and if approved the sale of Aviptadil. The collaboration provides for funding by Relief of certain clinical trials. If such candidate is approved by the FDA, the Company shall receive 50% of net product profits from the product sales in the NRx Pharmaceuticals territory, which includes the United States, Canada, and Israel; 15% of net product profits from the product sales in the Relief Therapeutics territory, which includes the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, the UK, the Channel Islands, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra, Malta, San Marino, and Vatican City; and 20% of net product profits from the product sales in all other countries. During 2021, the Company invoiced Relief $ 5,984,679 for reimbursable expenses and received $ 770,444 in payments from Relief for these reimbursable expenses. The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 5,470,897 as of June 30, 2021, due to the fact that the Company does not expect to receive payment for the remaining invoices, thus fully reserving for the accounts receivable balance. As of the date of this filing, Relief has reimbursed NRx Pharmaceuticals $ 10,904,065 for expenses, but has subsequently declined to pay approximately $ 6 million in invoiced costs associated with conduct of the IV clinical trial, reformulation, and manufacture of ZYESAMI TM . Relief has additionally declined to fund the costs of the inhaled trial. NRx Pharmaceuticals advised Relief that NRx Pharmaceuticals is funding those costs with other capital. NRx Pharmaceuticals further advised Relief in December 2020 that the formulation data provided to NRx Pharmaceuticals as part of the collaboration agreement was non-reproducible. Relief subsequently issued a public disclosure acknowledging that Relief knew about the stability problems at the time of the collaboration agreement. Relief declined to fund the development of a stable formulation. Share Subscription Facility Agreement — GEM NeuroRx previously entered into a share subscription facility agreement (“GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on an Exchange (any nationally recognized stock exchange or exchange platform in the world on which the Company will list its shares), GEM grants NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares from the Company for up to an aggregate value of approximately $95.6 million. The agreement also included certain provisions which would not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares thus preventing its usage. If NeuroRx was listed or completes a private transaction which results in a change of control of the Company, NeuroRx would issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the agreement. The reverse merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement would not have resulted in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue a warrant to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares and thus its usage is very unlikely. The warrant is not conditional upon any further events or completion of the merger. The warrant was issued March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrant”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately partially exercise the warrant for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7,500,018 . The GEM Warrant will be valid for a period of 23 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS three years from the date NeuroRx’s stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or consummation of a reverse merger transaction of the type contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a contingent liability for its obligation to issue to GEM certain equity instruments at a discounted per share price. Specifically, as the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability and settlement expense of $39,486,139 to reflect the fair value of the expected GEM Warrant to be issued. On March 28, 2021, when the GEM Warrant was issued, the Company recorded an additional charge of $21,365,641 to reflect the increased fair value of the GEM Warrant on its grant date. Upon issuance, the GEM Warrant was equity classified and was determined to be within the scope of ASC 718, Share-Based Payments (“ASC 718”). NeuroRx was required to register the Initial Exercised Shares on (a) the same registration statement on Form S-4 (or such other registration statement, if changed) in connection with the Merger, or (b) such other registration statement in connection with any other transaction which results in a public listing of NeuroRx. In addition, no later than 90 days following the consummation of the Big Rock merger, the Company was required to file with the SEC a registration statement to register under the Securities Act the resale by GEM of all shares issuable under the GEM Warrant other than the Initial Exercised Shares, which was filed with the Company's S-1 in July 2021. The GEM Warrant also includes “piggyback” registration rights. The GEM Warrants that were not exercised as of the Merger were modified and became Substitute Warrants ( 1,833,596 shares, adjusted for the Merger as discussed in Note 11). These Substitute Warrants were liability classified (see Note 11). The changes in fair value of these Substitute Warrants were recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of operations until these Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, at which time they were reclassified to additional paid-in capital. 11. Equity Common Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value $ 0.001 . As discussed in Note 5, we have retroactively adjusted the shares issued and outstanding prior to May 24, 2021 to give effect to the Exchange Ratio established in the Merger Agreement to determine the number of shares of common stock into which they were converted. The Company sold 65,526 and 0 shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and received gross proceeds of $ 1,436,274 and $ 0 , respectively. The Company sold 398,647 and 50,844 shares of common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and received gross proceeds of $ 8,363,132 and $ 176,990 , respectively. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BRPA and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters of BRPA’s initial public offering (“EBC”), entered into an amendment (“BCMA Amendment Agreement”) to the Business Combination Marketing Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2017 (“BCMA”), by and between BRPA and EBC. The BCMA Amendment Agreement provided that, in lieu of the cash fee payable to EBC pursuant to the BCMA, BRPA will issue to EBC at the Effective Time an aggregate of 200,000 shares of Common Stock and the BCMA (as amended by the BCMA Amendment Agreement) will terminate immediately following the Effective Time. The Company recognized the fair value of the 200,000 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the BCMA of $ 4,850,000 within general and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. 24 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Preferred Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value $ 0.001 . Series A, B-1, and B-1A Preferred Stock Prior to the Merger, the Company had authorized and issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, 1,050,695 shares of Series B-1 convertible preferred stock, and 316,848 shares of Series B-1A convertible preferred stock, par value of $ 0.001 per share, which was convertible into one share of common stock for each preferred share (collectively, the “Preferred Stock”) at any time, at the option of the holder. The Preferred Stock were not redeemable and the related stockholders were entitled to a subordinated liquidation preference should NeuroRx liquidate or wind up operations. The preferences also included voting rights on an as-converted basis, ride-along rights, and an anti-dilution provision. The liquidation preference was $ 1.00 per share for the Series A convertible preferred stock, $ 7.58 per share for the Series B-1 convertible preferred stock, and $ 6.82 per share for the Series B-1A convertible preferred stock, plus any declared but unpaid dividends. Upon an initial public offering or merger under certain conditions the Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock. On May 24, 2021, pursuant to the Merger (as described in Note 5), 2,367,543 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock were automatically converted into 7,480,836 shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio. Series B-2 Preferred Stock In 2020, the Company authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “B-2 Preferred Stock”), par value of $ 0.001 per share, convertible into one share of common stock for each share of B-2 Preferred Stock held. In March 2020, 4,167 shares of B-2 Preferred Stock were issued. The B-2 Preferred stock were not redeemable and the related stockholders were entitled to a subordinated liquidation preference should NeuroRx liquidate or wind up operations. The preferences also included voting rights on an as-converted basis, ride-along rights, and an anti-dilution provision. The liquidation preference was $ 12.00 per share plus any declared but unpaid dividends. The B-2 Preferred Stock could be converted into one share of common stock (subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalization) at any time, at the option of the holder. Upon an initial public offering or merger under certain conditions the B-2 Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock. On May 24, 2021, pursuant to the Merger (as described in Note 5), 4,167 outstanding shares of B-2 Preferred stock were automatically converted into 13,168 shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio. Common Stock Warrants As discussed in Note 10, on March 28, 2021, NeuroRx issued 3,329,812 fully vested common stock warrants, exercisable at a per share price of $3.19 until they expire on March 27, 2024 to GEM. The fair value on the date of issuance was $60,851,779. Upon issuance, 1,496,216 warrants were immediately exercised generating gross proceeds of $7,500,018. As further discussed below, upon the Merger the remaining unexercised GEM Warrants were modified to become Substitute Warrants in July 2021, GEM exercised their Substitute Warrants for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares for gross proceeds of $9,186,316 and the GEM Warrant was extinguished. 25 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The grant date fair value of GEM Warrants was determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company estimated its expected stock volatility based on historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies. The estimated fair value of common stock is based on sales to third parties. The following assumptions were used for the GEM Warrants upon issuance: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 28, ​ ​ ​ 2021 Strike price ​ ​ ​ $ 3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ ​ ​ ​ 80.0 % Risk-free rate ​ ​ ​ ​ 0.19 %- 0.28 % Expected term ​ ​ ​ ​ 3.00 - 5.00 ​ Dividend yield ​ ​ ​ ​ — ​ ​ Substitute Warrants As discussed in Note 5, in connection with the Merger, each warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Warrants, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant. Each Substitute Warrant will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx warrant multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 5, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Warrant that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx warrant that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Warrant had the conversion of NeuroRx warrants into the Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio (3.16:1) as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the warrant holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, all outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate 4,909,066 shares of the Company’s common stock with an average exercise price of $ 2.45 per share. With respect to warrants held by certain members of our Board of Directors, the Substitute Warrants were determined to be within the scope of ASC 718. For the portion of the warrants subject to the base Exchange Ratio (3.16:1), the warrants were fully vested and therefore the incremental fair value of these Substitute Warrants at the date of the modification date was immediately recognized as compensation expense. For the incremental portion of the warrants with a performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones), the Company 26 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash or Earnout Share Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at June 30, 2021 and therefore no expense has been recognized for this portion.. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. The Company recognized incremental compensation on the modification date totaling $2,330,572 which was recognized in General and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Unamortized compensation costs related to performance-based vesting conditions of these Substitute Warrants as of the modification date was $23,760,993. For any remaining outstanding warrants, as the warrant holders were no longer providing services at the date of the modification, in accordance with ASC 815, the Company concluded that the provisions in the Merger Agreement related to the Earnout Shares Milestone and the Earnout Cash Milestone and the contingent right to receive additional shares for these provisions precluded these Substitute Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As these Substitute Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Substitute Warrants should be recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Merger) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, with changes in fair value recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period of change. On May 24, 2021, the Company recorded a warrant liability of $53,337,336 for the Substitute Warrants, reclassified out of additional paid-in capital $38,220,448 representing the fair value of these NeuroRx warrants immediately before the modifications as a result of the Merger, and recognized a loss of $15,116,888 for the incremental fair value of these Substitute Warrants which is recorded in the Change in fair value of warrant liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Substitute Warrants for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 of $15,890,360 and $0, respectively. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. As discussed above the GEM Substitute Warrants were exercised in July 2021, and changes in the fair value of the warrant liability through the date of exercise were recognized in the statement of operations and upon exercise any remaining instruments were reclassified to additional paid-in capital. The fair value of the original NeuroRx warrants and Substitute Warrants as of the Merger Date was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Warrants Substitute Warrants Strike price ​ $ 7.58 -$ 15.84 ​ $ 1.53 -$ 3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % 80.0 % Risk-free rate ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % 0.03 %- 0.32 % Expected term ​ 0.57 - 3.69 ​ 0.57 - 3.69 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 3,450,000 Public Warrants. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the effective time (May 24, 2021) and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: 27 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Certain of the above conditions have not been met to redeem the Public Warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. Assumed Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Placement Warrants. The Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021. The Company measures the fair value of the warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s operating results for the current period. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 of $ 1,468,649 and $ 0 , respectively. Refer to Note 13 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. 28 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one Public Right and one-half of one Public Warrant. Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon exercise of the Units. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from November 20, 2017. The option grants to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years , respectively, from the effective date of the Company's registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Conversion of Rights Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 6,900,000 and 272,500 Public Rights and Placement Rights, respectively. At the Effective Time, each holder of a right received one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock at the Effective Time, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with the Merger, resulting in the issuance of 717,250 shares of Common Stock to holders of such rights. No fractional shares were issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration was required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares at the Effective Time, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the original unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Company's Initial Public Offering. The shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). ​ 12. Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that was subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . 29 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Options, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former option. Each Substitute Option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 5, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Option that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx option that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Option had the conversion of NeuroRx options into the Substitute Options been applied using the Exchange Ratio as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. As stated in the Merger Agreement, if any Substitute Options are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 1.50 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Options as a modification of the existing options. Incremental compensation costs, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified options over the fair value of the original options immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx options and Substitute Options was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Options Substitute Options Strike price ​ $ 1.00 -$ 72.30 ​ $ 0.20 -$ 14.58 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % 80.0 % Risk-free rate ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % 0.07 %- 0.79 % Expected term ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ The Substitute Options contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash or Earnout Share Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at June 30, 2021. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Options subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. 30 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For vested Substitute Options, the Company recognized incremental compensation on the modification date totaling $ 1,014,640 , of which $ 993,500 and $ 21,140 was recognized in General and administrative and Research and development, respectively, in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. For unvested Substitute Options, the Company will recognize incremental compensation over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date, taking into consideration the probability of the achievement of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones. Incremental compensation costs related to unvested Substitute Options as of the modification date was $ 25,877,473 . 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan At the Effective Time, the Company adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of June 30, 2021, 5,373,049 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan, inclusive of any shares of Common Stock subject to stock options, restricted stock awards or other awards that were assumed in the Merger and terminate as a result of being unexercised or are forfeited or repurchased by the Company, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2021 Plan equal to 5,373,049 shares of Common Stock. As of June 30, 2021, 2,919,493 shares have been awarded and 2,453,556 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the US Food and Drug Administration for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The following assumptions were used during the following periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Exercise price $ 11.69 -$ 23.41 ​ $ 2.22 -$ 3.07 ​ Risk-free rate of interest ​ 0.79 %- 1.24 % 0.79 %- 0.79 % Expected term (years) ​ 5.5 - 6.5 ​ 4.7 - 5.9 ​ Expected stock price volatility ​ 80 % 80 % Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ 31 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

The weighted average grant date fair value per share for employee stock and non-employee option grants during the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively was $ 14.31 and $ 18.37 . The weighted average grant date fair value per share for employee stock and non-employee option grants during the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively was $ 1.25 and $ 1.25 . At June 30, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation related to unvested employee and non-employee stock option awards granted, including unrecognized compensation costs related to Substitute Options of $ 25,877,473 , was $ 33,610,165 , of which the Company expects to recognize $ 9,117,887 over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.89 years.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for settlement and services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying value of notes payable approximated the estimated fair values due to their recent issuances. Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value 32 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at least annually. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and Earnout Cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements. The following table presents information about the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Description Level June 30, 2021 (As restated) December 31, 2020 Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Warrant liabilities (Note 11) ​ 3 ​ $ 22,845,113 ​ $ — Earnout Cash liability (Note 5) 3 ​ $ 25,874,896 ​ $ — ​ Warrant liabilities The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value the Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The Company uses a modified Black-Scholes model approach for the Substitute Warrants which applies a probability factor based on the probabilities of achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black Scholes options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical and peer company volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. The significant inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, 2021 At Effective Time ​ ​ (As restated) ​ Expected life ​ 0.2 - 4.9 ​ 0.3 - 5.0 ​ Volatility ​ 35.7 %- 85.9 % 39.0 %- 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.02 %- 0.85 % 0.03 %- 0.82 % ​ Dividend yield ​ — % — % Fair value of warrants ​ $ 3.78 -$ 10.09 ​ $ 14.56 -$ 22.72 ​ ​ A reconciliation of warrant liabilities is included below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value (As restated) Balance as of December 31, 2020 ​ $ — Additions pursuant to Merger ​ 40,204,122 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ( 17,359,009 ) Balance as of June 30, 2021 ​ $ 22,845,113 ​ Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. 33 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A reconciliation of the Earnout Cash liability is included below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2020 ​ $ — Additions pursuant to Merger ​ 25,520,195 Loss upon re-measurement ​ 354,701 Balance as of June 30, 2021 ​ $ 25,874,896 ​ Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares has been estimated using the trading price of our Common Stock at the Effective Time ($ 24.25 ), discounted based on the probability of the Earnout Shares Milestone being met as determined at the Effective Time, and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The contingent Earnout Shares, if achieved, would be issued to legacy NeuroRx shareholders. The Earnout Shares are a fixed number of shares to be issued to such shareholders on a pro rata basis. The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares was recognized as a deemed dividend. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares was $ 255,822,071 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $ 0 ). 14. Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021. For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the CARES Act to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, and modification to the net interest deduction limitations. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The Company continues to monitor any effects on its financial statements that may result from the CARES Act. Upon consummation of the Merger, a change in control was deemed to have occurred and the Company's net operating loss carrybacks could be subject to limitations. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of June 30, 2021. 15. Related Party Transactions The Company licenses patents that are owned by Glytech, LLC, pursuant to a license agreement (the Glytech Agreement). Glytech, LLC is owned by a co-founder and former Director of the Company, and therefore, a related party. The Glytech agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. During the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company paid a co-founder $ 125,000 and $ 0 , respectively, and during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, $ 125,000 and $ 82,569 , respectively, for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. These support services are ongoing. The Fourth Amendment to the Glytech Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2020, includes an equity value-triggered transfer of Excluded Technology from Glytech to NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Excluded Technology is defined in the 34 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Glytech Agreement as any technology, and any know-how related thereto, covered in the licensed patents that do not recite either D-cycloserine or lurasidone individually or jointly. This definition would cover pharmaceutical formulations, including some that NRx Pharmaceuticals considers “pipeline” or “future product” opportunities, that contain a combination of pharmaceutical components different from those contained in NRX-100 and NRX-101. The Excluded Technology will transfer to the Company for no additional consideration if the value of NRx Pharmaceuticals equity held by Glytech exceeds $50,000,000 at any time prior to August 6, 2022. After August 6, 2022, the additional IP will transfer to the Company at no cost. The Company believes the criteria have been met pending the registration of Glytech shares. The CEO of the Company is a major shareholder in the Company. Therefore, his services are deemed to be a related party transaction. He serves the company on a full-time basis and has an employment agreement with the Company and received compensation of $ 137,500 and $ 53,125 during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 286,250 and $ 121,875 during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The services are ongoing. The CEO’s son provides services related to website, IT, and marketing support under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Commercial Officer, who is responsible for assuring that the services are provided on financial terms that are at market. NRx Pharmaceuticals paid this family member a total of $ 11,100 and $ 18,605 during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 29,740 and $ 40,770 during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, NRx Pharmaceuticals pays Pill Tracker 2015 Ltd. (“Pill Tracker”) for services relating to the development of the inhaled use form of aviptadil. The CEO’s son and our CEO are the chief executive officer and the board chairman, respectively, of Pill Tracker. NRx Pharmaceuticals paid Pill Tracker $ 254,936 and $ 0 during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 395,757 and $ 0 during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The CEO’s other son, as a medical doctor, provides research services related to the development of the inhaled use form of aviptadil, under the supervision of the CEO, who is responsible for assuring that the services are provided on financial terms that are at market. NRx Pharmaceuticals paid this family member a total of $ 4,615 and $ 4,820 during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 6,110 and $ 4,820 during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in accounts payable were $ 44,201 and $ 149,067 due to the above related parties as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 16. Subsequent Events Related Party Transaction Subsequent to June 30, 2021, the Company and Pill Tracker entered into a statement of work dated July 26, 2021 under the Master Services Agreement dated April 1, 2020 for the provision of additional support of inhaled ZYESAMI TM in phase 2/3 clinical trials with a total cost of $ 157,110 . ​ ​ 35 Table of Contents Item 2.

All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (""BRPA""), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (“Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals"" or the ""Company”). ​ NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Acute Suicidal Behavior/Ideation (ASIB) in Bipolar Disorder and ZYESAMI (aviptadil), an intravenous and inhaled drug to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19. The NRx Pharmaceuticals Antidepressant Regime was developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Prof. Daniel Javitt, PhD, MD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRx Pharmaceuticals Antidepressant Regime begins with a single dose of ketamine, an FDA approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for acute suicidal crisis associated with bipolar depression. NRX-101 combines DCS, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from multiple Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a P2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on the STABIL-B study ( www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the current standard of care) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. In March 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals initiated development of RLF-100 (aviptadil acetate) (now reformulated as ZYESAMI) in partnership with Relief Therapeutics. ZYESAMI is based on 50 years of research, pioneered by Professor Sami Said, on the role of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide in preventing and treating acute lung injury by protecting the Type II cell in the lung. The rights to Dr. Said’s scientific work are licensed by NRx Pharmaceuticals from the Research Foundation of the State University of New York and NRx Pharmaceuticals expects to cross-license such rights to Relief Therapeutics for use outside US, Canada, and Israel. In that partnership and pursuant to the Relief Agreement, Relief has committed to fund all costs of formulations and clinical development of the RLF Product for the treatment of COVID-19. The companies agreed that NRx Pharmaceuticals would lead all development and sales in the United States, Canada, and Israel, with NRx Pharmaceuticals receiving 50% of the profits generated in those territories. Relief is to lead the development and sale of the RLF Product in the rest of the world with NRx Pharmaceuticals receiving 15% of profits in Europe and the United Kingdom, together with 20% of profits in the rest of the world. For the six months ended June 30, 2021. 36 Table of Contents Relief has reimbursed NRx Pharmaceuticals for approximately $10.9 million of expenses, but has declined to pay approximately $6 million in invoiced costs associated with conduct of the RLF Product clinical trial, reformulation, and manufacture of ZYESAMI. Relief has additionally declined to fund the costs of the inhaled trial product. NRx Pharmaceuticals has advised Relief that NRx Pharmaceuticals is funding those costs with other capital. In an open-label, single center trial at Houston Methodist Hospital, ZYESAMI demonstrated a statistically significant 9-fold advantage in probability of survival and recovery from respiratory failure compared to the standard of care among patients with COVID-19 Respiratory Failure. On June 1, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals reported phase IIb/III study results of ZYESAMI in patients with respiratory failure due to critical COVID-19. The study identified a statistically significant increase in the likelihood that patients treated with ZYESAMI would be alive and free of respiratory failure at 60 days, compared to those treated with placebo, and identified a significantly shorter median hospital stay. The clinical study report filed with the FDA further documented statistically significant advantages for ZYESAMI on all major secondary endpoints. On the basis of these results, the Company applied for FDA Emergency Use Authorization on May 31, 2021 and is currently awaiting the FDA’s response to such application. Should Emergency Use Authorization be granted, this would provide the Company with a one-year period during which ZYESAMI could be marketed for the treatment of COVID-19 in the United States in advance of the Company filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA for formal approval of ZYESAMI for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the recently completed clinical trial and the additional clinical trials currently underway, including the NIH ACTIV3b/TESICO trial (NCT 04843761). If authorized for use, ZYESAMI would be the first drug in the United States indicated specifically for COVID-19 patients who are critically ill with respiratory failure. In July 2021, the nation of Georgia issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for intravenous ZYESAMI (aviptadil) for the treatment of critical COVID-19. Pursuant to this EUA, the Company has sent a team of physicians to Georgia to train local doctors about administering ZYESAMI and the effects of the medicine. The supply of intravenous doses by the Company is being discussed with the Georgia Ministry of Health and with the Ministries of Health of surrounding nations. Although the initial focus has been on the use of intravenous ZYESAMI, the Company has received permission from the FDA to test inhaled ZYESAMI in a phase 2/3 clinical trial for patients with early disease. The Company believes that the inhaled drug will be more convenient for patients to self-administer than the intravenous drug, provided patients are still able to inhale normally and do not have inflammatory debris clogging the alveoli. This clinical trial commenced in January 2021 and is expected to conclude by October 2021. In addition, the Company announced in July 2021 that the phase 2/3 trial for the use of inhaled ZYESAMI has been extended to the nation of Georgia. The Company has also commenced work on a third potential drug product by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Israel (MoU) for an exclusive, worldwide license to develop a novel Coronavirus vaccine (BriLife) developed by the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR). The vaccine has demonstrated a statistically-significant increase in COVID-neutralizing antibody (a sign of immunity to SARS-CoV-2) compared to placebo in phase 2a trials conducted in Israel. The vaccine has further shown indications of neutralizing antibody against that Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in early human studies and in preclinical studies. Under the MoU, the Company is initiating a phase 2b/3 dose-confirmatory trial of the vaccine against COVID-19 in the nation of Georgia. The IIBR will provide technical assistance for the clinical trial. The clinical trial in Georgia will take place at the same time as the completion of the second phase of clinical trials in Israel. If the clinical trials are successful, and subject to the negotiation of definitive licensing agreements with the IIBR, the Company would have an exclusive license to commercialize the vaccine in exchange for agreed upon milestone and royalty payments. Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals, net loss was $117,613 and $102,287, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $25,606,487 and $1,487,769, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals had an accumulated deficit of $115,786,207. 37 Table of Contents COVID-19 Outbreak On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 Outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 Outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak continues to evolve as new variants of the virus appear, including the delta variant. As such, NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot estimate the full magnitude, whether positive or negative, that the pandemic will have on NRx Pharmaceuticals’ business. If the COVID-19 Outbreak continues, it may have a material adverse effect on NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2020 and beyond. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. Alternatively, the COVID-19 Outbreak could have a material positive effect on market demand for the COVID-19 targeted therapeutics currently under development by NRx Pharmaceuticals. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 Outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, NRx Pharmaceuticals. is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the year ending December 31, 2021 and beyond. Aside from our COVID-19 related trials, as a result of the COVID-19 Outbreak, most of our other trials have been halted.

Liquidity and Capital Resources NRx Pharmaceuticals has generated no revenues, has incurred operating losses since inception, and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. From the inception of the ZYESAMI drug development program NRx Pharmaceuticals had funded all operating expenses related to the US development of ZYESAMI and the portion of corporate overhead attributable to that program from the Relief Agreement. The proceeds recorded as “Reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics” amounted to $771,244 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Pursuant to the Relief Agreement, NRx Pharmaceuticals is responsible for not exceeding the Relief Product trial budget of $8.3 million by more than 30% (approximately $10.7 million) for the original sample size of 144 participants (the “ Initial Budget ”). In October 2020, the study’s Data Safety Monitoring Board and statistical consultant advised NRx Pharmaceuticals to increase the size of the study to at least 200 participants, resulting in an additional $4 million in potential study costs. The Relief Agreement states that costs of drug formulation, manufacture, CMC, stability, etc., are not included within the Initial Budget, however, Relief is required to fund the costs of formulation, stability, and manufacturing at MedisourceRx, Bachem, and Nephron Pharmaceuticals. The Relief Agreement states that in the event Relief does not approve additional overages to the Initial Budget, NRx Pharmaceuticals shall be free to bring in other parties in order to complete the aviptadil study. The Relief Agreement further provides for Relief to fund the costs associated with the clinical development of the inhaled Relief Product in the United States in reliance upon NRx Pharmaceuticals' agreement to conduct, manage, supervise and oversee its clinical development. Should Relief not fund the costs associated with the clinical development of the inhaled Relief Product in the United States, then NRx Pharmaceuticals shall have the freedom to bring a replacement investor. Relief has declined to pay approximately $6 million in invoiced costs associated with conduct of the IV trial, reformulation, and manufacture of ZYESAMI incurred subsequent to December 31, 2020. Relief has additionally declined to fund the costs of the inhaled ZYESAMI product. NRx Pharmaceuticals has initiated the inhaled use clinical trial with other capital. Reverse Recapitalization Merger Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. At June 30, 2021, the fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated to be $25,874,896. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $255,822,071 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $0). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $88,837,121. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase 42 Table of Contents price of $10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date. The Company received $8,100,000 in net proceeds after transaction costs. NRx Pharmaceuticals expects to continue to incur operating losses and net cash outflows until such time as it generates a level of revenue from sale or licensing of drug products to support its cost structure. There is no assurance that NRx Pharmaceuticals will achieve profitable operations and if achieved, whether it will be sustained on a continued basis. NRx Pharmaceuticals intends to fund ongoing activities by raising additional capital through equity or debt financings. There can be no assurance that NRX will be successful in raising that additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to NRx Pharmaceuticals. If NRx Pharmaceuticals is unable to raise sufficient additional capital, NRx Pharmaceuticals may be compelled to reduce the scope of its operations and planned capital expenditures. Prior to the Merger, the Company sold 62,366 shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and received gross proceeds of $1,436,274. The Company sold 398,647 shares of common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and received gross proceeds of $8,363,132. In addition, 1,496,216 warrants were exercised generating gross proceeds of $7,500,018. Subsequent to June 30, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals received $9,186,316 from the exercise of the GEM Warrant for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ research programs beyond 2021 would require additional funding either from sales of product or from external investment. Until such time as NRx Pharmaceuticals is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of ZYESAMI will commence in 2021 or that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements NRx Pharmaceuticals is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. NRx Pharmaceuticals has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates NRx Pharmaceuticals' management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the valuation of conversion features of convertible notes and common stock, the valuation of stock options and warrants and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. 44 Table of Contents Fair value of common and preferred stock Prior to the Merger, in order to determine the fair value of shares of its common stock, the Company's board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of its common stock and preferred stock based on arms-length transactions with third party investors. Subsequent to the Merger, the Board determines the fair value of the Common Stock based on the closing market price on the date of grant. Share-based compensation Our stock-based awards are classified as equity (stock options and warrants). We recognize related share-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the awards. We estimate the fair value of all stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model which requires the use of subjective assumptions that could materially impact the estimation of fair value and related compensation expense to be recognized. One of these assumptions include the expected volatility of our stock price. Developing this assumption requires the use of judgment. The Company, both prior to and after the Merger, lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. We also estimate the fair value of our common stock based on third party sales of our common stock Warrant liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance or date of modification, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach and the fair value of the Substitute Warrants was estimated using a modified Black Scholes valuation approach which applies a probability factor based on the Earnout Cash Milestone and Earnout Shares Milestone probabilities of achievement at each reporting period. Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 45 Table of Contents Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (“certifying officers”) have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of June 30, 2021. Our certifying officers concluded that, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2021. ​ Per Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. ​ Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. The material weakness was due to ineffective risk assessment related to review procedures for complex transactions. This led to a deficiency in the design and implementation of appropriate review controls for complex warrant transactions. The material weakness resulted in a restatement of its financial statements to reclassify the Company’s Substitute Warrants as described in the Explanatory Note to this Quarterly Report. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ In light of the restatement of our financial statements included in this amendment, we plan to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Management is in the process of implementing remediation procedures to address the control deficiency that led to the material weakness. The remediation plan included, but is not limited to, the implementation of additional review procedures regarding the method for accounting for warrants issued in connection with an equity transaction. ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We may become involved in various legal actions incidental to our business. As of the date of this report, we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes to the risk factors that we have previously disclosed in our Registration Statement. 46 Table of Contents Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock On July 12, 2021, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-257438) was declared effective (“Registration Statement”). We filed the Registration Statement to permit certain holders of the shares of our Common Stock to resell such shares (Selling Securities Holders). We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Securityholders. We also registered the issuance of an aggregate of 3,586,250 shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. We will receive the proceeds from any exercise of warrants for cash. We intend to use the proceeds the exercise of warrants for cash for general corporate, funding of clinical trial programs and working capital purposes. Item 5. Other Information.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021 (“Effective Time”), we consummated the business combination (“Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company that develops novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and the treatment and prevention of life-threatening pulmonary diseases through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company's foundation product, NRX-101 (d-Cylcoserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of suicidal bipolar depression, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). NRX-101 is covered by multiple U.S. and foreign patents, including a Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx Pharmaceuticals by Glytech, LLC. The Company’s product for the treatment of acute respiratory distress in Critical COVID-19 patients, ZYESAMI ® , has been awarded Fast Track designation by the FDA. ZYESAMI is included in the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) ACTIV-3b Phase III clinical study. 2. Liquidity As of March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 40.2 million in cash. Since inception, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable. The Company is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. On August 23, 2021, the Company completed a private placement and issued 2,727,273 shares of common stock and preferred investment options to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,727,273 shares of common stock. The purchase price for one share of common stock and one preferred investment option was $ 11.00 . The preferred investment options have an exercise price of $ 12.00 . The net proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $ 27.4 million. On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a private placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of common stock and preferred investment options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock. The purchase price for one share of common stock and one preferred investment option was $ 3.195 . The preferred investment options have an exercise price of $ 3.07 per share. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $ 23.0 million. The Company believes that it currently has sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through at least the next twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company’s operations. 7 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP (the “Reverse Recapitalization”). Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The consolidated results of operations prior to the Reverse Recapitalization are those of NeuroRx. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and losses per share, prior to the Merger, have been retroactively restated based on shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Merger. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the Earnout Cash liability, valuation of common and preferred stock, stock options, warrants, and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 8 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 11) Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Cash is the only financial instrument that is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company’s cash is deposited in accounts at large financial institutions, and amounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the cash is held. The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk of loss. Research and Development Costs The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach (see Notes 9 and 11). Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Loss Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, and other dilutive instruments because their effect would be anti-dilutive in the periods in which the Company incurs a net loss. The following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share attributable to common stock for the periods in which a net loss is presented because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31, ​ 2022 2021 Stock options 2,906,948 489,255 Common stock warrants 17,521,753 1,200,307 Earnout Shares 22,209,280 ​ — Earnout Shares from exercised Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants 1,229,925 ​ — ​ Since the closing of the Merger, of the 516,025 shares of common stock issued for the exercise of stock options, 185,472 shares of common stock are contingently issuable Earnout Shares and are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for computing EPS until the contingent conditions are satisfied.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. For the three-months ended March 31, 2022, there were no new accounting pronouncements or updates to recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, that management believes materially affect the Company’s present or future results of operations, overall financial condition, liquidity or disclosures. ​ 4. Reverse Recapitalization As discussed in Note 1, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), BRPA and Merger Sub closed the Merger with NeuroRx, as a result of which NeuroRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRPA. While BRPA was the legal acquirer of NeuroRx in the Merger, for accounting purposes, the Merger is treated as a Reverse Recapitalization whereby NeuroRx is deemed to be the accounting acquirer and the historical financial statements of NeuroRx became the historical financial statements of BRPA (renamed NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) upon the closing of the Merger. Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of NeuroRx at the Closing Date consists of 50,000,000 shares (“Closing Consideration”) of BRPA common stock (“Common Stock”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) each share of NeuroRx common stock and each share of the NeuroRx convertible preferred stock that was convertible into a share of NeuroRx common stock at a one-to-one ratio pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation, was converted into Common Stock equal to 3.16 (the “Exchange Ratio”). Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option or warrant to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Substitute Options” and the “Substitute Warrants,” respectively), based on an exchange ratio of 4.96 :1 (the “Option Exchange Ratio”), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the original instrument. In addition, the securityholders of NeuroRx (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time received the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock, including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of outstanding shares of NeuroRx preferred stock (as calculated pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation), immediately prior to the Effective Time, was converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the Closing Consideration and the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who owned NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”), of which 935,608 and 1,920,492 are subject to the terms and conditions of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants, if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NRX COVID-19 Drug (as defined in the Merger Agreement) receives emergency use authorization by the FDA and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NRX COVID-19 Drug (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $ 100.0 million in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NRX COVID-19 Drug and the listing of the NRX COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares 11 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five ( 5 ) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. The Earnout Cash Milestone was recognized as a contingent liability and measured at an estimated fair value at the Closing Date and will be remeasured at estimated fair value at each period end thereafter until earned or December 31, 2022 (see Note 11). The Earnout Shares Milestone was recognized in equity. The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately 22,209,280 shares and $ 88.8 million. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying option or warrant had the conversion of the legacy NeuroRx option and warrants into the Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1). If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held in escrow pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option or warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option or warrant holder. 5.

(“Relief Therapeutics”) in the amount of $ 0.5 million. The Relief Therapeutics Loan matured on April 6, 2022 and bears interest at 2 % per annum payable in arrears. The Relief Therapeutics Loan was paid in full on April 6, 2022. Paycheck Protection Program Loan On April 28, 2020, the Company received $ 0.1 million in loan funding from the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”), established pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The unsecured PPP Loan accrued interest on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1 % per annum. The Company received full forgiveness of all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the PPP Loan as of February 11, 2021. The forgiveness of the PPP Loan qualified for debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishment s, and as a result, the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was written off in the amount of $ 0.1 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively, and the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment totaling $ 0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Sponsored Research Agreement with National Jewish Health On February 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“Research Agreement”) with National Jewish Health (“NJ Health”), a Colorado not-for-profit institution. Under the terms of the Research Agreement, the Company agreed to sponsor a research study at NJ Health relating to the impact of the Company’s' Aviptadil on propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in alveolar type II cells in vitro (the “Study”). In return for performance of the Study under the Research Agreement, the Company has committed to pay NJ Health approximately $ 0.4 million. As of March 31, 2022, the Company has paid NJ Health $ 0.3 million of the total committed amount. 13 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ZYESAMI Manufacturing, Production, Supply and Distribution Agreements On August 25, 2020, the Company and Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Nephron”) signed an agreement for the manufacturing of finished pharmaceutical product of Aviptadil intravenous formulation and the development of an inhaled (nebulizer) formulation of Aviptadil. The Company has agreed to purchase products from Nephron for a fixed price. On September 29, 2020, the Company and Cardinal Health signed an exclusive distribution agreement, as well as a third-party logistics agreement on October 1, 2020. Cardinal Health will manage warehousing, distribution, and invoicing for the potential sale of Aviptadil in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. On October 9, 2020, the Company signed an agreement with PolyPeptide Group, North America for the supply of Good Manufacturing Practice Grade Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (“API”) Aviptadil. This gives NRx Pharmaceuticals a significant reduction in the cost of procuring API. The Company has agreed to purchase a total of $ 5.3 million worth of product and services, of which $ 2.4 million has not been paid for as of March 31, 2022. Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Relief Therapeutics for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The Collaboration Agreement provides for funding by Relief Therapeutics of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the Collaboration Agreement. Relief Therapeutics reimbursed the Company $ 10.9 million but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs of research and development. The Company advised Relief Therapeutics that the Company is funding those costs with other capital. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics filed a lawsuit against the Company and its former CEO claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. Relief Therapeutics’ complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. The Company believes the lawsuit is baseless and without merit. On January 10, 2022, the Company filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming Relief Therapeutics breached and repudiated the Collaboration Agreement. The Company’s complaint seeks damages of at least $ 185.0 million. The parties to the lawsuit have agreed to engage in mediation in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute its claims against Relief Therapeutics. Legal Proceedings From time to time the Company is involved in litigation, claims, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur. Share Subscription Facility Agreement - GEM In 2019, NeuroRx entered into a share subscription facility agreement (the “GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on an exchange (any nationally recognized stock exchange or exchange platform in the world on which the Company will list its shares), GEM granted NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares from the Company for up to an aggregate value of approximately $ 95.6 million. The agreement also included certain provisions which would not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. If NeuroRx were listed or completed a private transaction resulting in a change of control of the Company, NeuroRx would be required to issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $ 1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the GEM Agreement. The reverse merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement did not result in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. 14 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue warrants to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. The warrants are not conditional upon any further events or completion of the merger. The warrants were issued March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrants”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately exercise a portion of the warrants for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7.5 million. The GEM Warrants are valid for a period of three years from the date of the consummation of the reverse merger transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which was May 24, 2021. This contingent liability at December 31, 2020, represented an obligation that resulted in the issuance of certain equity at a discounted per share price. As the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability of $ 39.5 million to reflect the fair value of the GEM Warrants. On March 28, 2021, NeuroRx recorded additional settlement liability of $ 21.4 million to reflect the change in the fair value of the Company’s common stock. On March 28, 2021, NeuroRx reclassed the settlement liability to equity upon the issuance of the GEM Warrants. On July 27, 2021, GEM exercised the remaining GEM Warrants for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares (adjusted for the Merger, discussed in Note 9) for gross proceeds to the Company of $ 9.2 million and the GEM Warrants were extinguished. 9. Equity Common Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value $ 0.001 . As discussed in Note 4, we have retroactively adjusted the shares issued and outstanding prior to May 24, 2021 to give effect to the Exchange Ratio established in the Merger Agreement to determine the number of shares of common stock into which they were converted. The Company sold 7,824,727 shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2022, generating net proceeds of $ 23.0 million. The Company sold 1,829,337 shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2021, and received gross proceeds of $ 14.4 million. Preferred Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value $ 0.001 . The Company has no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Common Stock Warrants Substitute Warrants In connection with the Merger, each warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Warrants, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant. Each Substitute Warrant will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx warrant multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Warrant 15 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Warrant that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx warrant that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Warrant had the conversion of NeuroRx warrants into the Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1) as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the warrant holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate 4,909,066 shares of the Company’s common stock with an average exercise price of $ 2.45 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Warrants as a modification of the existing warrants. Incremental fair value, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified warrants over the fair value of the original warrants immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx warrants and Substitute Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Warrants Substitute Warrants Strike price ​ ​ $ 7.58 -$ 15.84 ​ ​ $ 1.53 -$ 3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.57 - 4.42 ​ 0.57 - 4.42 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ With respect to warrants held by certain members of our Board of Directors, the Substitute Warrants were determined to be within the scope of ASC 718 and were fully vested at the Effective Date. Further, the Substitute Warrants were determined to contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at March 31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Warrants subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. The Company recognized incremental compensation in the second quarter of 2021 on the modification date totaling $ 2.3 million which was recognized in general and administrative in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Unamortized compensation costs related to performance-based vesting conditions of the Substitute Warrants as of the modification date was $ 23.8 million. 16 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In the event the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestones are met, the Company will recognize an additional deemed dividend of $ 24.4 million and $ 3.1 million, respectively, if and when such conditions are met. Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had 3,450,000 Public Warrants outstanding. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the Effective Time and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon their redemption or liquidation of the Company. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: Certain of the above conditions have not been met to redeem the Public Warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, no Public Warrants were exercised. Assumed Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Placement Warrants. The Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022. The Company measures the fair value of the warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s operating results for the current period. 17 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $ 0.2 million.

The Preferred Investment Options have an exercise price of $ 3.07 per share and may be exercised any time on or after August 2, 2022. The form of the Preferred Investment Option is a warrant. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 2.94 , exercise price of $ 3.07 , term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8 %, risk-free rate of 1.60 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). The grant date fair value of these Preferred Investment Options was estimated to be $ 15.5 million on February 2, 2022 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of March 31, 2022. In addition, on February 2, 2022, the Company issued fully vested Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent with an exercise price of $ 3.99 . As these Preferred Investment Options were issued for services provided in facilitating the private placement, the Company recorded the fair value of such Preferred Investment Options as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at February 2, 2022, the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 2.94 , exercise price of $ 3.99 , term of five years beginning August 2, 2022, volatility of 82.8 %, risk-free rate of 1.60 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). ​ 10. Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that were subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former option. Each Substitute Option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock 18 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS subject to each Substitute Option that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx option that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Option had the conversion of NeuroRx options into the Substitute Options been applied using the Exchange Ratio as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. As stated in the Merger Agreement, if any Substitute Options are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 5.10 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Options as a modification of the existing options. Incremental compensation costs, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified options over the fair value of the original options immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx options and Substitute Options was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Options Substitute Options ​ Strike price ​ ​ $ 1.00 -$ 72.30 ​ ​ $ 0.20 -$ 14.58 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ The Substitute Options contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at March 31, 2022. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Options subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. For unvested Substitute Options, the Company will recognize incremental compensation over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date, taking into consideration the probability of the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone. Incremental compensation costs related to unvested Substitute Options as of the modification date was $ 25.9 million. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan At the Effective Time, the Company adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of March 31, 2022, 6,049,178 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan. As of January 1, 19 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2022, 676,129 shares were added to the 2021 Plan under an evergreen feature that automatically increases the reserve with additional shares of Common Stock for future issuance under the Incentive Plan each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (A) 1% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (B) a smaller number of shares determined by the Board. The Substitute Options do not reduce the number of shares authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan. As of March 31, 2022, 5,154,123 shares have been awarded and 895,055 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and has limited company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the limited company-specific historical volatility and implied volatility as well as historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. The expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The following assumptions were used during the following periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, 2022 ​ December 31, 2021 ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ Exercise price ​ $ 2.61 -$ 3.10 ​ ​ $ 6.44 -$ 23.41 Risk-free rate of interest ​ 1.80 %- 2.56 % ​ 0.69 %- 1.45 % Expected term (years) ​ 5.5 - 6.5 ​ 5.25 - 6.5 Expected stock price volatility ​ 82.8 % ​ 80.0 %- 85.9 % Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ The following table summarizes the Company’s employee and non-employee stock option activity under the Plan for the following periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ Aggregate ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ average ​ intrinsic ​ ​ Number of ​ average ​ remaining ​ value ​ shares exercise price term (years) (in thousands) Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 2,400,315 ​ $ 6.28 7.8 ​ $ 4,224 Granted 552,000 ​ ​ 3.00 10.0 ​ ​ — Forfeited ( 45,367 ) ​ ​ ( 14.05 ) — ​ ​ — Outstanding as of March 31, 2022 ​ 2,906,948 ​ $ 5.54 ​ 8.0 ​ $ 1,006 Options vested and exercisable as of March 31, 2022 ​ 1,131,708 ​ $ 3.09 ​ 6.2 ​ $ 969 ​ The weighted average grant date fair value per share for employee stock and non-employee option grants during the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $ 2.27 .

At March 31, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation related to unvested employee and non-employee stock option awards granted, including 20 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS unrecognized compensation costs related to Substitute Options of $ 25.9 million, was $ 30.4 million, of which the Company expects to recognize $ 5.9 million over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.87 years.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for settlement and services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021. The carrying value of notes payable approximated the estimated fair values due to their recent issuances. Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and Earnout Cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements. The following table presents information about the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31 ​ December 31 Description Level 2022 ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Warrant liabilities (Note 10) ​ 3 ​ $ 135 ​ $ 292 Earnout Cash liability (Note 4) 3 ​ $ 2,479 ​ $ 4,582 ​ Warrant liabilities The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value the Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The significant unobservable inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liability that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, 2022 Stock price on valuation date ​ $ 2.45 ​ Exercise price per share ​ $ 11.50 ​ Expected life ​ 4.15 ​ Volatility ​ 94.9 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 2.43 % ​ Dividend yield ​ 0.00 % ​ Fair value of warrants ​ $ 0.99 ​ ​ A reconciliation of warrant liabilities is included below (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, 2022 Balance as of December 31, 2021 ​ $ 292 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ( 157 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 ​ $ 135 ​ Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The most significant inputs include whether (a) if the Company files an NDA, that the FDA approves the Company’s NDA for ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101, (b) if such approval is granted, whether such approval will be received on or before December 31, 2022, and (c) if such approval is granted, whether ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101 will be listed in the FDA’s Orange Book on or before December 31, 2022. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that the Company believes market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. A reconciliation of the Earnout Cash liability is included below (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, 2022 Balance as of December 31, 2021 ​ $ 4,582 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ( 2,103 ) Balance as of March 31, 2022 ​ $ 2,479 ​ ​ 12. Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of March 31, 2022. 22 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13. Related Party Transactions The Company licenses patents that are owned by Glytech, LLC (“Glytech”), pursuant to a license agreement (the “Glytech Agreement”). Glytech is owned by a co-founder and former Director of the Company. The Glytech Agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company paid a co-founder $ 0.1 million for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. These support services are ongoing. The Fourth Amendment to the Glytech Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2020, includes an equity value-triggered transfer of Excluded Technology from Glytech to NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Excluded Technology is defined in the Glytech Agreement as any technology, and any know-how related thereto, covered in the licensed patents that do not recite either D-cycloserine or lurasidone individually or jointly. This definition would cover pharmaceutical formulations, including some that NRx Pharmaceuticals considers “pipeline” or “future product” opportunities, that contain a combination of pharmaceutical components different from those contained in NRX-100 and NRX-101. The Excluded Technology will transfer to the Company for no additional consideration if aggregate the value of NRx Pharmaceuticals equity held by Glytech exceeds $ 50.0 million on any date prior to August 6, 2022, based on the average daily value of the equity held by Glytech during a period of 20 consecutive days prior to such date. The Company believes the criteria have been met pending the registration of Glytech shares. The Chief Scientist of the Company, Dr. Jonathan Javitt, is a major shareholder in the Company and a member of the Board of Directors. Therefore, his services are deemed to be a related party transaction. He served the Company on a full-time basis as CEO under an employment agreement with the Company until March 8, 2022 and currently serves under a Consulting Agreement with the Company as Chief Scientist thereafter and received compensation of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These services are ongoing. Zachary Javitt is the son of Dr. Jonathan Javitt. Zachary Javitt provides services related to website, IT, and marketing support under the supervision of the Company’s Interim CEO and the Company’s Senior Director of Global Communications, who are responsible for assuring that the services are provided on financial terms that are at market. The Company paid this family member a total of $ 0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. These services are ongoing. In addition, the Company pays PillTracker for digital health product development required to track the use of Aviptadil in clinical trials. FDA guidance recommends such solutions. Zachary Javitt and Jonathan Javitt are the chief executive officer and board chairman, respectively, of PillTracker. PillTracker agreements and transactions are submitted to the General Counsel of the Company and the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Related Person Transactions Policy. On July 26, 2021, the Company and PillTracker entered into a statement of work (“SOW”) under the Master Service Agreement dated April 1, 2020 (“MSA”). Under this SOW, PillTracker provides support for the inhaled ZYESAMI Phase 2/3 clinical trials by monitoring SP02 and Heart Rate in patients in a sub-study of the AVICOVID-2 clinical trial in the U.S. to determine the physiological effects of ZYESAMI vs. a placebo. PillTracker’s responsibilities include set-up, patient monitoring, and the provision of tablets and other necessary hardware. The total cost under the SOW is $ 0.2 million. The work under this SOW has been suspended by mutual agreement pending the Company’s review of its inhaled trial. On November 15, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals and Pill Tracker entered into a Supplemental Task Order (“STO”) amending SOW No. 1, under the MSA. The additional work under the STO focuses on study preparation and custom, software interface buildout of a connected medication adherence and patient-monitoring platform to support participants of the AVICOVID-2 clinical trial of inhaled ZYESAMI in the U.S., and future studies of ZYESAMI with compatible protocol designs. The expected cost of the STO is $ 0.4 million. The STO has been suspended by mutual agreement pending the Company’s review of its inhaled trial. 23 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition and plan of operations together with NRx Pharmaceuticals' unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (“BRPA”), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals” or the “Company”). NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing, through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx, NRX-100 and NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Bipolar Depression in patients with Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) and Sub-Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (“SSIB”), and ZYESAMI ® (aviptadil), an intravenous and inhaled drug to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19 and potentially other respiratory disorders. NRX-100 and NRX-101 were developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Dr. Daniel Javitt, MD, PhD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRX-100 and NRX-101 therapy begins with a single dose of ketamine (NRX-100), a Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for bipolar depression with ASIB and SSIB. NRX-101 combines d-Cycloserine, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Biomarker Letter of Support, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline and stabilization in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a P2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on data from the STABIL-B study (NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the current standard of care) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. NRx Pharmaceuticals initiated a Phase II SSIB clinical study in the second quarter of 2022 for which enrollment has begun. The Company plans to initiate a Phase III registrational ASIB study in the second half of 2022. In March 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals initiated development of RLF-100 (aviptadil acetate) (now reformulated as ZYESAMI by NRx Pharmaceuticals) in partnership with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief Therapeutics”). ZYESAMI is based on 50 years of research, pioneered by Professor Sami Said, on the role of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/Aviptadil in preventing and treating acute lung injury by protecting the Type II cell in the lung. The rights to Professor Said’s scientific work are licensed by the Company from the Research Foundation for the State University of New York. NRx Pharmaceuticals and Relief Therapeutics entered into a collaboration agreement on September 18, 2020 (the “Collaboration Agreement”) for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The Collaboration Agreement provided for funding by Relief Therapeutics of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as established sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as 25 Table of Contents defined in the Collaboration Agreement. Relief Therapeutics has reimbursed the Company approximately $10.9 million but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. Relief Therapeutics’ complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. The Company believes that the claims are baseless and without merit. On January 10, 2022, the Company filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming Relief Therapeutics breached and repudiated the Collaboration Agreement. The Company’s complaint seeks damages of at least $185.0 million. The parties to the lawsuits agreed to engage in mediation in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute its claims against Relief Therapeutics. In an open-label, single center trial at Houston Methodist Hospital, ZYESAMI demonstrated a statistically significant 9-fold advantage in probability of survival and recovery from respiratory failure compared to the standard of care among patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. On March 29, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals reported top-line Phase IIb/III study results of ZYESAMI in patients with respiratory failure due to Critical COVID-19. Though it did not meet statistical significance for the pre-specified primary endpoint of “alive and free of respiratory failure” (P=.08), the study identified a two-fold statistically significant odds of survival at day 60 (P=.03), and significant advantages on secondary endpoints, for those treated with ZYESAMI compared to those treated with placebo. On the basis of these results, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases selected NRx Pharmaceuticals as an industry partner for participation in the ACTIV3b/TESICO trial (NCT 04843761) in which patients with Critical COVID-19 are randomized to aviptadil, remdesivir, and placebo. NRx Pharmaceuticals provides doses of aviptadil as the industry partner and the U.S. Government funds all other costs of research. As of March 2022, approximately 465 patients with Critical COVID-19 were enrolled and treated with either aviptadil or placebo. The endpoint of the trial is superiority on an ordinal scale that includes survival and recovery from respiratory failure at 90 days. As of the February 25, 2022 the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) meeting, no unexpected adverse events were identified in association with ZYESAMI and the trial was cleared to continue enrolling. To date, the DSMB has not declared futility of the aviptadil arm of the ACTIV-3b trial, although futility has been declared for all other investigational products selected in the ACTIV-3b trial studying Critical COVID-19 patients. The DSMB is scheduled to review the data again on May 25, 2022. A previously targeted DSMB meeting for end of April was moved to this new date to allow for the vast majority of enrolled patients to have reached 90 days. NRx Pharmaceuticals applied for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) on May 31, 2021. In November 2021, the FDA notified us that it was unable to issue the EUA at that time due to insufficient data regarding the known and potential benefits of ZYESAMI and the known and potential risks of ZYESAMI in patients suffering from critical COVID-19 with respiratory failure. In November 2021, the FDA also declined a request for Breakthrough Therapy designation, mentioning in its reply that the request did not adequately compare the safety and efficacy of aviptadil to existing therapies in Critical COVID-19 patients, such as remdesivir. In response, in February 2022, the Company filed a new request for EUA in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who are at immediate risk of death despite treatment with remdesivir and other approved therapies. This new request is based on a post-hoc analysis of the approximately 70% of patients in the randomized study that were also treated with remdesivir and included safety data on approximately 750 patients treated with ZYESAMI in our clinical trials, our Expanded Access Programs, our Right To Try Program and the ACTIV-3b trial. On April 20, 2022, the Company submitted a new Breakthrough Therapy designation request focused on this narrower population of patients that are at immediate risk of death despite treatment with remdesivir. As of the date hereof, these requests are still pending. Should an EUA be granted, this would provide NRx Pharmaceuticals with a one-year period during which ZYESAMI could be marketed for the treatment of COVID-19 in the United States in advance of the filing a new drug application (“NDA”) with the FDA for formal approval of ZYESAMI for the treatment of COVID-19. If authorized for use, we believe ZYESAMI would fill a high unmet need for COVID-19 patients who are critically ill with respiratory failure, as current options have only limited applicability in this patient segment. 26 Table of Contents Manufacturing and scalability of ZYESAMI are a major focus of the Company. Working with its manufacturing partners, the Company has the capability to produce batch sizes of 1.5kg and potentially larger of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of ZYESAMI. In addition to producing ZYESAMI API at a scale suitable for commercial quantities, the Company has gained insights into how to address the chemical basis for the instability of the formulated drug product ZYESAMI in solution. The Company has now demonstrated a formulation of ZYESAMI with refrigerated stability of up to 8 months and expected multi-year frozen stability (-20°C). In January 2022, the Company filed a Composition of Matter patent application that describes this extended stability form of aviptadil. In the process, the Company has identified specific aspects of the manufacturing process that it believes are key to preserving the stability of aviptadil for stockpiling and commercial supply chain purposes. On October 8, 2021, the Company submitted an updated manufacturing module to its FDA Investigational New Drug file documenting this change in manufacture and stability. On November 8, 2021, the FDA communicated with the Company that the manufacturing update had been reviewed and that no “clinical hold” items had been identified (this is the regulatory language that allows an investigational product to be given to patients). The Company initiated a parallel manufacturing process to conform to EU and UK standards. In October 2021, the Company announced that a European Qualified Person audit was conducted, and no major deficiencies were identified, thus clearing ZYESAMI’s use in EU investigational programs. Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $13.4 million and $25.5 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals had an accumulated deficit of $196.7 million. ​ Components of Results of Operations Operating expenses Research and development expenses NRx Pharmaceuticals’ research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with NRx Pharmaceuticals’ clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and equity-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation, consultant fees, and professional fees for legal and accounting services. Settlement Expense Settlement expense consists primarily of settlement expenses related to the GEM Warrant. See Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies – Share Subscription Facility Agreement – GEM” of the notes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. Reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics Reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics consists of reimbursable expenses as part of the Collaboration Agreement. See Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies – Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement” of the notes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. 27 Table of Contents Results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 The following table sets forth NRx Pharmaceuticals’ selected statements of operations data for the following periods (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three months ended March 31, ​ Change ​ ​ 2022 2021 Dollars ​ ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating expenses: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Research and development ​ $ 5,483 ​ $ 2,909 ​ $ 2,574 ​ General and administrative ​ 10,222 ​ 2,101 ​ $ 8,121 ​ Settlement expense ​ ​ — ​ ​ 21,366 ​ $ (21,366) ​ Reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics ​ — ​ (771) ​ $ 771 ​ Total operating expenses ​ $ 15,705 ​ $ 25,605 ​ $ (9,900) ​ Loss from operations ​ $ (15,705) ​ $ (25,605) ​ $ 9,900 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other (income) expenses: ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain on extinguishment of debt ​ ​ — ​ ​ (121) ​ $ 121 ​ Interest expense ​ 3 ​ 5 ​ $ (2) ​ Change in fair value of warrant liability ​ (157) ​ — ​ $ (157) ​ Change in fair value of Earnout Cash liability ​ (2,103) ​ — ​ $ (2,103) ​ Total other (income) expenses ​ (2,257) ​ (116) ​ $ (2,141) ​ Net loss ​ $ (13,448) ​ $ (25,489) ​ $ 12,041 ​ ​ Operating expenses Research and development expenses For the three months ended March 31, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded $5.5 million of research and development expenses compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase of $2.6 million related primarily to an increase of $2.1 million in clinical trials and development expenses related to ZYESAMI, an increase of $0.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, and an increase of $0.3 million in other regulatory and process development expenses. The $5.5 million and $2.9 million of research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, include $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses For the three months ended March 31, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded $10.2 million of general and administrative expenses compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase of $8.1 million was primarily, related to an increase of $4.4 million in legal, professional and accounting fees, an increase of $2.2 million in insurance expense, an increase of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, and an increase of $0.7 million in other general and administrative expense. The $10.2 million and $2.1 million of general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, include $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation. Reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics For the three months ended March 31, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded no reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics compared to $0.8 million of reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Other (income) expenses 28 Table of Contents Gain on extinguishment of debt For the three months ended March 31, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded no gain on extinguishment of debt compared to $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease of $0.1 million related to the forgiveness of the PPP Loan which resulted in a gain on extinguishment for the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Change in fair value of warrant liability For the three months ended March 31, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded a gain of $0.2 million related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability. The gain of $0.2 million related to the decrease in the fair value of the Placement Warrants assumed pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Change in fair value of Earnout Cash liability For the three months ended March 31, 2022, NRx Pharmaceuticals recorded a gain of $2.1 million related to the change in fair value of the Earnout Cash liability. The gain related to the decrease in the fair value of the Earnout Cash liability pursuant to the Merger Agreement. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources NRx Pharmaceuticals has generated no revenues, has incurred operating losses since inception, and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Until such time as NRx Pharmaceuticals is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of ZYESAMI will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals believes that it currently has sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through at least the next twelve months from the date hereof. NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operating. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that additional financing will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively affect the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company's operations. Private Placement On February 2, 2022, the Company sold 7,824,727 shares of common stock and preferred investment options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock, and received net proceeds of $23.0 million. Reverse Recapitalization Merger and Subsequent Equity Issuances Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100.0 million in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. At March 31, 2022, the fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been 29 Table of Contents estimated to be $2.5 million. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $253.1 million with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $0). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $88.8 million. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date. The Company received $8.1 million in net proceeds after transaction costs from the sale of PIPE Shares. ​ 30 Table of Contents The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the periods shown below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, 2022 ​ December 31, 2021 ​ (Unaudited) ​ Balance Sheet Data: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash ​ $ 40,202 ​ $ 27,605 Total assets ​ ​ 43,601 ​ ​ 32,729 Earnout cash liability ​ ​ 2,479 ​ ​ 4,582 Total liabilities ​ ​ 11,912 ​ ​ 11,923 Total stockholders' equity (deficit) ​ ​ 31,689 ​ ​ 20,806 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, ​ ​ 2022 2021 ​ ​ (Unaudited) Statement of Cash Flow Data: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net cash used in operating activities ​ $ (10,380) ​ $ (3,015) Net cash used in investing activities ​ (3) ​ — Net cash provided by financing activities ​ ​ 22,980 ​ ​ 14,427 Net increase in cash ​ $ 12,597 ​ $ 11,412 ​ Operating activities During the three months ended March 31, 2022, operating activities used $10.4 million of cash, primarily resulting from a net loss of $13.4 million, increased by net non-cash gains of $1.0 million, including $2.1 million of gain from the change in fair value of earn out liability and $0.2 million of gain from the changes in fair value of warrant liability, partially offset by $1.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, and an increase in net operating assets of $4.0 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, operating activities used $3.0 million of cash, primarily resulting from a net loss of $25.5 million, reduced by non-cash charges of $21.6 million, including $21.4 million of non-cash settlement expense related to the GEM Warrant, $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million; and an increase in net operating assets of $0.9 million. Financing activities During the three months ended March 31, 2022, financing activities provided $23.0 million of cash resulting from the net proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of common stock and preferred investment options in a private placement.

Milestone Payments Pursuant to the legal settlement with Sarah Herzog Memorial Hospital Ezrat Nashim (“SHMH”) in September 2018, which included the license of intellectual property rights from SHMH, an ongoing royalty of 1% to 2.5% of NRX-101 gross sales is due to SHMH, together with milestone payments of $0.3 million, upon completion of phase 3 trials and commercial sale of NRX-101. The milestone payments for developmental and commercial milestones range from $0.1 million to $0.8 million. Annual maintenance fees are up to $0.2 million. 31 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements NRx Pharmaceuticals is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. NRx Pharmaceuticals has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates NRx Pharmaceuticals' management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the Earnout Cash Liability, stock-based compensation, and the valuation of warrants. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. Earnout Cash Liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The most significant inputs include whether (a) the FDA approves the Company’s NDAs for ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101, (b) if such approval is granted, whether such approval will be received on or before December 31, 2022, and (c) if such approval is granted, whether ZYESAMI and/or NRX-101 will be listed in the FDA’s Orange Book on or before December 31, 2022. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed in consideration of the uncertainties associated with the obligations. Changes in the estimated fair value of the Earnout Cash Liability are recognized as a gain or loss in the statements of operations. Fair value of common and preferred stock Prior to the Merger, in order to determine the fair value of shares of its common stock, the Company's board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of its common stock and preferred stock based on arms-length transactions with third party investors. Subsequent to the Merger, the Board determines the fair value of the Common Stock based on the closing market price on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation We measure stock option awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The straight-line method of expense recognition is applied to awards with service-only conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock-based awards, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock-based 32 Table of Contents awards, and our expected dividend yield. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded warrants on our common stock and historical volatility of a set of our publicly traded peer companies. We estimate the expected term of our options using the ""simplified"" method for awards that qualify as ""plain-vanilla"" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent reasonable estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Warrant liability We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach. ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously reported in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 33 Table of Contents the year ended December 31, 2021, management identified the lack of segregation of duties in preparing and approving disclosures as a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. ​ We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In response to the identified material weakness, our management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, developed a remediation plan that includes implementation of a Disclosure Committee. On March 30, 2022 the Board of Directors approved the Disclosure Committee Charter. Subsequent to March 31, 2022, and prior to the date hereof, the Disclosure Committee met for the first time. We plan to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the Disclosure Committee, and other improvements to the internal control structure, during the remainder of 2022. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than those changes described above, there have been no material changes in internal control over financial reporting since December 31, 2021. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. On October 6, 2021, Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief Therapeutics”) filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) in New York State Court (the “NYS Court”), claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the collaboration agreement dated September 18, 2020 (the “Collaboration Agreement”). The Complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. The Company believes that the claims are baseless and without merit. On January 10, 2022, the Company filed a complaint in NYS Court, claiming Relief Therapeutics breached and repudiated the Collaboration Agreement. The Company’s complaint seeks damages of at least $185 million. The parties to the lawsuits agreed to engage in mediation in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute its claims against Relief Therapeutics. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully resolve the dispute through mediation or that, in the event the dispute continues in litigation, we will be successful in our claims or in our opposition to Relief Therapeutics’ claims. ​ On January 18, 2022, a federal securities class action complaint was filed against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer at the time, Jonathan Javitt, and its former Chief Financial Officer, William Fricker, by purported stockholder Cristian Dal Bosco (the “Dal Bosco Complaint”). The Dal Bosco Complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or otherwise failed to disclose that the Company’s EUA application contained insufficient data regarding the potential benefits and risks of ZYESAMI and, accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve it. The Company believes the Dal Bosco Complaint is baseless and without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful. The Dal Bosco Complaint has led to the filing, and threatened filing, of almost verbatim class action complaints. ​ In addition to the matters described above, we may become involved in various legal actions incidental to our business. As of the date hereof, we are not involved in any other legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, but regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, and diversion of management resources. ​ Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have disclosed the risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report on Form 10-K”). There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or may not be able to assess, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 34 Table of Contents Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock On February 2, 2022, the Company completed a Private Placement and issued 7,824,727 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of $3.195 per share and the Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,824,727 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $3.07 per share from August 2, 2022 through August 2, 2027 (collectively, the “Additional Securities”). The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $25.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. In connection with this Private Placement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the purchasers of the Additional Securities.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021 (“Effective Time”), we consummated the business combination (“Merger”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRX Pharmaceuticals. Unless the context suggests otherwises, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The Company is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company that develops novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and both the treatment and prevention of life-threatening pulmonary diseases through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. The Company's foundation product, NRX-101 (d-Cyloserine/Lurasidone), for the treatment of suicidal bipolar depression, has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, a Special Protocol Agreement, and a Biomarker Letter of Support by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). NRX-101 is covered by multiple US and foreign patents, including a recently-issued Composition of Matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,583,138) that was transferred to NRx by Glytech, Inc. On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief”) for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The collaboration agreement provides for funding by Relief of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territori es. Relief has reimbursed the Company $ 10.9 million for expenses but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs of the IV clinical trial, formulation and manufacture of Aviptadil (reformulated as ZYESAMI®). Relief has additionally declined to fund the costs of the inhaled ZYESAMI clinical trial. The Company advised Relief that the Company is funding those costs with other capital. See Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional Information regarding the Company and Relief . In July 2021 the Company was granted exclusive worldwide development rights to an investigational COVID-19 vaccine called BriLife™ pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Israel, Ministry of Defense. The Company is commencing a registration trial of the BriLife vaccine in the nations of Georgia, Ukraine, Israel, and additional countries. The Company expects to enter into a long-term royalty-bearing licensing agreement for the commercialization of the vaccine. ​ ​ 2. Liquidity As of September 30, 2021, the Company had $ 38,883,569 in cash. Since inception, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable. The Company is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. On August 23, 2021, the Company completed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) and issued 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $ 11.00 per share and Preferred Investment Options (the “Preferred Investment Options”, and, collectively with the shares of common stock issued under the Private Placement, the “Securities”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $ 12.00 . The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $ 30,000,000 , before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. Accordingly, the Company believes that it currently has sufficient funds and, if necessary, the ability to reduce expenditures, to support operations through the next twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company’s operations. 8 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COVID-19 Outbreak On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 Outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 Outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. Aside from our COVID-19 related trials, as a result of the COVID-19 Outbreak, most of our other trials have been halted. Except as otherwise discussed in the preceding sentence and otherwise in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes or impact of COVID-19 on our business. However, the full impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak continues to evolve as of the date hereof. If the COVID-19 Outbreak continues, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the balance sheet, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP (the “Reverse Recapitalization”). Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. NeuroRx was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the following predominant factors: The consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Reverse Recapitalization are those of NeuroRx. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and losses per share, prior to the Merger, have been retroactively restated based on shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Merger. 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the valuation of common and preferred stock, stock options, warrants, contingent consideration and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 12) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consist of balances due from collaborative partners. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated, and specific partner issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances. Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Cash is the only financial instrument that is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company’s cash is deposited in accounts at large financial institutions, and amounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company 10 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the cash is held. The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk of loss. Research and Development Costs The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Modification of stock options and warrants A change in any of the terms or conditions of stock options and warrants is accounted for as a modification. Incremental stock-based compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified option/warrant over the fair value of the original option/warrant immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the ordinary shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested stock options and warrants to board members, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested stock options, we recognize over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date. If the fair value of the modified option is lower than the fair value of the original option immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award. The accounting for incremental fair value of warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification which may result in a reduction of additional paid-in capital, recognition of costs for services rendered, or recognized as a deemed dividend. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, 11 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach (see Notes 10 and 12). Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, and other dilutive instruments because their effect would be anti-dilutive in the periods in which the Company incurs a net loss. The following outstanding shares of common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of the diluted net earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stock for the periods in which a net loss is presented because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30, ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, ​ 2021 2020 2021 2020 Stock options 2,388,811 — 2,388,811 1,754,623 Common stock warrants 9,305,790 — 9,305,790 1,690,192 Earnout Shares ​ 22,209,280 ​ — ​ 22,209,280 ​ — Earnout Shares from exercised Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants ​ 1,229,925 ​ — ​ 1,229,925 ​ — ​ Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes: Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . This guidance removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC 740. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and it also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation 12 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in certain areas. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and adoption must be as of the beginning of the Company’s annual fiscal year. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021, with no material impact on our financial statements. In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchange of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options , which provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as (1) an adjustment to equity and, if so, the related earnings per share (EPS) effects, if any, or (2) an expense and, if so, the manner and pattern of recognition. The amendments in this ASU are effective January 1, 2022, including interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted ASU 2021-04 on January 1, 2021, with no material impact on our financial statements. ​ 4. Reverse Recapitalization As discussed in Note 1, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), BRPA closed the Merger with NeuroRx, as a result of which NeuroRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRPA. While BRPA was the legal acquirer of NeuroRx in the Merger, for accounting purposes, the Merger is treated as a Reverse Recapitalization, whereby NeuroRx is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the historical financial statements of NeuroRx became the historical financial statements of BRPA (renamed NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) upon the closing of the Merger. Under this method of accounting, BRPA is treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of NeuroRx at the Closing Date consists of 50,000,000 shares (“Closing Consideration”) of BRPA common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share (“Common Stock”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of NeuroRx common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share, and each share of the NeuroRx convertible preferred stock that was convertible into a share of NeuroRx common stock at a one-to-one ratio pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation, was converted into Common Stock equal to 3.16 (the “Exchange Ratio”). Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option or warrant to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Substitute Options” and the “Substitute Warrants,” respectively), based on an exchange ratio of 4.96 :1 (the “Option Exchange Ratio”), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the original instrument. In addition, the securityholders of NeuroRx (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time received the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock, including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of outstanding shares of NeuroRx preferred stock (as calculated pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation), immediately prior to the Effective Time, was converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the Closing Consideration and the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”), of which 935,608 and 1,920,492 are subject to the terms and conditions of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants, if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NRX COVID-19 Drug (as defined in the Merger Agreement) receives emergency use authorization by the 13 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FDA and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NRX COVID-19 Drug (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $ 100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NRX COVID-19 Drug and the listing of the NRX COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five ( 5 ) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. The Earnout Cash Milestone was recognized as a contingent liability and measured at an estimated fair value at the Closing Date and will be each period end thereafter until earned or December 31, 2022 (see Note 12). The Earnout Shares Milestone was recognized in equity and, upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $ 253,130,272 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend (see Note 12). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately 22,209,280 shares and $ 88,837,121 . In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying option or warrant had the conversion of the legacy NeuroRx option and warrants into the Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1). If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held in escrow pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option or warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option or warrant holder. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $ 10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $ 10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date.

Convertible Notes Payable On February 12, 2020, a Qualified Financing Event (as defined below) occurred when the Company received cumulative investment proceeds in excess of $ 10,000,000 from the sale and issuance of common shares. The fair value of the Company’s common shares was $ 10.63 per share. The 2017 Notes (as defined below) and the 2018 Notes (as defined below) in the aggregate principal amount of $ 2,800,000 were converted into 1,005,458 common shares (at the discounted price of $ 2.78 per share), and the related unpaid and accrued interest totaling $ 369,660 were also converted into 132,739 common shares of the Company (at the discounted price of $ 2.78 per share). Additionally, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment for the difference between the carrying value of the convertible notes, unamortized debt discount, and the value of the embedded put option and the fair value of the common shares of $ 0 and $ 306,641 during the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The Company issued the shares of common stock pursuant to this conversion on September 23, 2020. 2017 Convertible Notes Payable On November 16, 2017 and November 19, 2017, the Company issued convertible notes (“2017 Notes”), as amended for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 2,500,000 . The 2017 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 % per annum and principal and interest were due and payable four years from the date of issuance. Upon either a sale of the Company’s assets or all of its capital stock, or a change of control, the principal balance would double and be repaid. Upon closing of either a sale of the Company’s shares for at least $ 10,000,000 or a public offering of the Company’s securities (“Qualified Financing Event”), the outstanding principal balance will be converted into the number of such securities sold at a conversion price equal to 80% of the securities negotiated share price . 2018 Convertible Notes Payable On January 5, 2018 and April 25, 2018, the Company issued convertible notes (“2018 Notes”), as amended for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 300,000 . The 2018 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 % per annum and were due and payable four years from the date of issuance. Upon either a sale of the Company’s assets or all of its capital stock, or a change of control, the principal balance would double and be repaid. Upon closing of a Qualified Financing Event, the outstanding principal balance will be converted into the number of such securities sold at a conversion price equal to 80% of the securities negotiated share price. The January 5, 2018 note for $ 100,000 was not amended and interest was unpaid, as such, the January 5, 2018 note and related accrued interest were classified as current liabilities. The April 25, 2018 note for $ 200,000 was amended similar to the 2017 Notes to accrue interest and to be paid at maturity with the principal. The proceeds received upon issuing the 2017 Notes and the 2018 Notes were first allocated to the fair value of the embedded put with the remainder to the debt host instrument. The Company recognized a loss of $ 0 and $ 0 during the 16 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 0 and $ 27,160 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to the estimated increase in fair value of the embedded put. The discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt. The Company amortized debt discount of $ 0 to interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and $ 0 and $ 16,475 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company paid no interest during the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. 8. Notes Payable Relief Therapeutics Loan On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Relief (the “Relief Therapeutics Loan”) in the amount of $ 500,000 . The loan matures on April 6, 2022 and bears interest at 2 % per annum payable in arrears. Paycheck Protection Program Loan On April 28, 2020, the Company received $ 119,842 in loan funding from the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”), established pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The unsecured PPP Loan accrues interest on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1 % per annum, and there is a six month deferment period until equal installment payments of $6,744 of principal and interest are due. The term of the PPP Loan is two years . To the extent the loan amount is not forgiven under the PPP Loan, the Company is obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest, beginning seven months from the date of the PPP Loan note, until the maturity date. The PPP Loan amount may be eligible for forgiveness in the event that (1) at least 75% of the PPP Loan proceeds are used to cover payroll costs and the remainder is used for mortgage interest, rent and utility costs over the eight week period after the PPP Loan is made, and (2) the number of employees and compensation levels are generally maintained. Forgiveness of the PPP Loan is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the PPP Loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such PPP Loan based on future adherence to the forgiveness criteria. The Company used the entire PPP Loan for qualifying payroll expenses, and filed for loan forgiveness on December 30, 2020. The Company received full forgiveness of all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the PPP Loan as of February 11, 2021. The forgiveness of the PPP Loan qualified for debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments , and as a result, the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was written off in the amount of $ 119,842 and $ 968 , respectively, and the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment totaling $ 120,810 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Note Payable -- Vendor On July 1, 2019, the Company converted certain accounts payable into a loan (the “Note Payable — Vendor”) with a vendor in the amount of $ 154,190 . The loan matured on July 1, 2020. The loan bears interest, compounded daily, at 6 % annual interest. As of September 30, 2021, the note payable was paid in full. 17 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Sponsored Research Agreement with National Jewish Health On February 8 2021, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“Research Agreement”) with National Jewish Health (“NJ Health”), a Colorado not-for-profit institution. Under the terms of the Research Agreement, NRx Pharmaceuticals agreed to sponsor a research study at NJ Health relating to the impact of NRx Pharmaceuticals' Aviptadil on propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in alveolar type II cells in vitro (the “Study”). In return for performance of the Study under the Research Agreement, NRx Pharmaceuticals has committed to pay NJ Health approximately $ 399,320 . During the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals paid NJ Health $ 90,112 and $ 216,269 , respectively, of the total committed amount. Aviptadil Manufacturing, Production, Supply and Distribution Agreements On August 25, 2020, the Company and Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Nephron”) signed an agreement for the manufacturing of finished pharmaceutical product of Aviptadil intravenous formulation and the development of an inhaled (nebulizer) formulation of Aviptadil. Nephron will serve as the exclusive and primary supplier of the product for both clinical and commercial purposes, supplying 100 % of the Company’s annual requirements. The Company has agreed to purchase products from Nephron for a fixed price. On September 29, 2020, the Company and Cardinal Health signed an exclusive distribution agreement, as well as a 3rd party logistics agreement on October 1, 2020. Cardinal Health will manage warehousing, distribution, invoicing for the potential sale of Aviptadil in the United States and Puerto Rico. On October 9, 2020, the Company signed an agreement with PolyPeptide Group, North America for the supply of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) Aviptadil (VIP). This gives NRx Pharmaceuticals a significant reduction in the cost of procuring API. The Company has agreed to purchase a total of $ 5,255,000 worth of product and services, of which $ 1,407,500 has been paid for and recorded as a prepaid asset on the Company’s balance sheet as of September 30, 2021. 18 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On January 4, 2021 the Company and Aerogen Limited (“Aerogen”) signed a supply agreement for the supply of certain products, including the Aerogen Solo Nebulizer System and Aerogen Ultra, solely for the purposes of carrying out clinical trials relating to inhalation delivery of Aviptadil for treatment of pulmonary insufficiency and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. Pill Tracker Ltd. (PillTracker) is an agent of the Company per the supply agreement (see Note 14) and is managing the supply agreement at the Company’s request. On July 1, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals and BriLife LLC signed an agreement for a Phase II Inhaled clinical trial of Aviptadil in the nation of Georgia with a total cost of approximately $ 7,400,000 . The contract is cancelable with 60 days’ notice. The Phase II Inhaled clinical trial of Aviptadil in the nation of Georgia has not begun and the Company may decide not to proceed with this trial. Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Relief for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The collaboration agreement provides for funding by Relief of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil, as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the collaboration agreement. Relief has reimbursed the Company $ 10.9 million for expenses related to COVID-19 but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs of Research and Development, including the IV clinical trial, the inhaled use trial, formulation and manufacture of ZYESAMI (Aviptadil), statistical analysis, and regulatory filings. The financial statements reflect $ 13.8 million in unreimbursed Research and Development costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, prior to the allocation of corporate overhead. Additional unreimbursed costs were reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company advised Relief that the Company is funding those costs with other capital. On October 6, 2021, Relief filed a lawsuit against the Company and its CEO claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the collaboration agreement. Relief’s complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the collaboration agreement. The Company believes the lawsuit is baseless and without merit. However, the parties to the lawsuit have agreed to engage in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation and have agreed to hold a mediation in early January 2022. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute significant counterclaims against Relief. Share Subscription Facility Agreement - GEM NeuroRx previously entered into a share subscription facility agreement (“GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on an Exchange (any nationally recognized stock exchange or exchange platform in the world on which the Company will list its shares), GEM grants NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares from the Company for up to an aggregate value of approximately $ 95.6 million. The agreement also included certain provisions which would not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. If NeuroRx was listed or completes a private transaction which results in a change of control of the Company, NeuroRx would issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $ 1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the agreement. The reverse merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement would not have resulted in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue a warrant to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. The warrant is not conditional upon any further events or completion of the merger. The warrant was issued March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrant”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately partially exercise the warrant for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7,500,018 . The GEM Warrant were valid for a period of 19 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS three years from the date NeuroRx’s stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or consummation of a reverse merger transaction of the type contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This contingent liability at December 31, 2020, represented an obligation that resulted in the issuance of certain equity at a discounted per share price. As the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability of $ 39,486,139 to reflect the fair value of the GEM Warrant. On March 28, 2021, NeuroRx recorded additional settlement liability of $ 21,365,641 to reflect the change in the fair value of the Company’s common stock. On March 28, 2021, NeuroRx reclassed the settlement liability to equity upon the issuance of the GEM Warrant. NeuroRx was required to register the Initial Exercised Shares on (a) the same registration statement on Form S-4 (or such other registration statement, if changed) in connection with the Merger, or (b) such other registration statement in connection with any other transaction which results in a public listing of NeuroRx. In addition, no later than 90 days following the consummation of the Merger, the Company was required to file with the SEC a registration statement to register under the Securities Act the resale by GEM of all shares issuable under the GEM Warrant other than the Initial Exercised Shares, which was filed with the Company's S-1 in July 2021. The GEM Warrant also includes “piggyback” registration rights. On July 27, 2021, GEM exercised the remaining GEM Warrant for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares (adjusted for the Merger, discussed in Note 10) for gross proceeds to the Company of $ 9,186,316 and the GEM Warrant was extinguished. 10. Equity Common Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value $ 0.001 . As discussed in Note 4, we have retroactively adjusted the shares issued and outstanding prior to May 24, 2021 to give effect to the Exchange Ratio established in the Merger Agreement to determine the number of shares of common stock into which they were converted. The Company sold 3,238,338 and 3,642,515 shares of common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, generating gross proceeds of $ 31,134,816 and $ 39,624,175 , respectively. Of the 511,065 shares of common stock issued for the exercise of stock options, 185,472 shares of common stock are contingently issuable Earnout Shares and are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for computing EPS until the contingent conditions are satisfied. There are 1,044,453 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the GEM warrants which are contingently issuable Earnout Shares and are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for computing EPS until the contingent conditions are satisfied. The Company issued 2,334,370 and 3,830,586 shares of common stock pursuant to warrants and Unit Purchase Options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, and received gross proceeds from the warrant exercise of $ 9,199,471 and $ 16,699,489 , repectively. The Company issued 634,045 and 834,045 shares of common stock for consulting services during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, and recognized non-cash consulting expense in general and administrative expenses of $ 7,925,511 and $ 12,775,511 , respectively. The Company sold 292,534 and 343,378 shares of common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, and received gross proceeds of $ 1,412,067 and $ 1,589,092 , respectively. The Company issued 1,138,199 shares of common stock to settle the notes conversion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and recorded a loss of $ 306,641 . Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BRPA and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters of BRPA’s initial public offering (“EBC”), entered into an amendment (“BCMA Amendment Agreement”) to the Business 20 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Combination Marketing Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2017 (“BCMA”), by and between BRPA and EBC. The BCMA Amendment Agreement provided that, in lieu of the cash fee payable to EBC pursuant to the BCMA, BRPA will issue to EBC at the Effective Time an aggregate of 200,000 shares of Common Stock and the BCMA (as amended by the BCMA Amendment Agreement) will terminate immediately following the Effective Time. The Company recognized the fair value of the 200,000 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the BCMA of $ 4,850,000 within general and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. Preferred Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value $ 0.001 . Series A, B-1, and B-1A Preferred Stock Prior to the Merger, the Company had authorized and issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, 1,050,695 shares of Series B-1 convertible preferred stock, and 316,848 shares of Series B-1A convertible preferred stock, par value of $ 0.001 per share, which was convertible into one share of common stock for each preferred share (collectively, the “Preferred Stock”) at any time, at the option of the holder. The Preferred Stock were not redeemable and the related stockholders were entitled to a subordinated liquidation preference should NeuroRx liquidate or wind up operations. The preferences also included voting rights on an as-converted basis, ride-along rights, and an anti-dilution provision. The liquidation preference was $ 1.00 per share for the Series A convertible preferred stock, $ 7.58 per share for the Series B-1 convertible preferred stock, and $ 6.82 per share for the Series B-1A convertible preferred stock, plus any declared but unpaid dividends. Upon an initial public offering or merger under certain conditions the Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock. On May 24, 2021, pursuant to the Merger (as described in Note 4), 2,367,543 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock were automatically converted into 7,480,836 shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio. Series B-2 Preferred Stock In 2020, the Company authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “B-2 Preferred Stock”), par value of $ 0.001 per share, convertible into one share of common stock for each share of B-2 Preferred Stock held. In March 2020, 4,167 shares of B-2 Preferred Stock were issued. The B-2 Preferred stock were not redeemable and the related stockholders were entitled to a subordinated liquidation preference should NeuroRx liquidate or wind up operations. The preferences also included voting rights on an as-converted basis, ride-along rights, and an anti-dilution provision. The liquidation preference was $ 12.00 per share plus any declared but unpaid dividends. The B-2 Preferred Stock could be converted into one share of common stock (subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalization) at any time, at the option of the holder. Upon an initial public offering or merger under certain conditions the B-2 Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock. On May 24, 2021, pursuant to the Merger (as described in Note 4), 4,167 outstanding shares of B-2 Preferred stock were automatically converted into 13,168 shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio. Common Stock Warrants On March 28, 2021, NeuroRx issued 3,329,812 fully vested common stock warrants, exercisable at a per share price of $ 3.19 until they expire on March 27, 2024 to GEM (See Note 8). The fair value on the date of issuance was $ 60,851,779 . Upon issuance, 1,496,216 warrants were immediately exercised generating gross proceeds of $ 7,500,018 . On July 27, 2021, GEM exercised the remaining GEM Warrant for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares for gross proceeds of $ 9,186,316 and the GEM Warrant was extinguished. 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Substitute Warrants In connection with the Merger, each warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Warrants, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant. Each Substitute Warrant will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx warrant multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Warrant that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx warrant that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Warrant had the conversion of NeuroRx warrants into the Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio ( 3.16 :1) as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the warrant holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate 4,909,066 shares of the Company’s common stock with an average exercise price of $ 2.45 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Warrants as a modification of the existing warrants. Incremental fair value, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified warrants over the fair value of the original warrants immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx warrants and Substitute Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Warrants Substitute Warrants Strike price ​ ​ $ 7.58 -$ 15.84 ​ ​ $ 1.53 -$ 3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.57 - 4.42 ​ 0.57 - 4.42 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ With respect to warrants held by certain members of our Board of Directors, the Substitute Warrants were determined to be within the scope of ASC 718 and were fully vested at the Effective Date. Further, the Substitute Warrants were determined to contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Milestone or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at September 30, 2021. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Warrants subject to 22 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. The Company recognized incremental compensation on the modification date totaling $ 2,330,572 which was recognized in General and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for nine months ended September 30, 2021. Unamortized compensation costs related to performance-based vesting conditions of the Substitute Warrants as of the modification date was $ 23,760,993 . With respect to the remaining outstanding warrants, the incremental fair value of the Substitute Warrants of $ 2,691,799 was recognized as a deemed dividend as the Company concluded there is a transfer of value from the common shareholders to the holders of the Substitute Warrants as the change in the number of underlying shares and the decreased exercise price would result in the common shareholders becoming more diluted if and when the Substitute Warrants are converted. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the modification date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $ 0 ). Further, in the event the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestones are met, the Company will recognize an additional deemed dividend of $ 24,379,657 and $ 3,068,732 , respectively, if and when such conditions are met. Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 3,450,000 Public Warrants. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the Effective Time and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: Certain of the above conditions have not been met to redeem the Public Warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, 1,144 Public Warrants were exercised for gross proceeds of $ 13,156 . Assumed Placement Warrants 23 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Placement Warrants. The Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2021. The Company measures the fair value of the warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s operating results for the current period. The Company recognized a loss on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 of $ 260,238 and $ 0 , respectively. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 of $ 1,208,412 and $ 0 , respectively. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities.

Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one Public Right and one-half of one Public Warrant. Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon exercise of the Units. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from November 20, 2017. The option grants to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years , respectively, from the effective date of the Company's registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. 24 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On July 23, 2021, the outstanding 600,000 Units were converted on a cashless basis into 499,630 shares of the Company’s common stock. Conversion of Rights Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 6,900,000 and 272,500 Public Rights and Placement Rights, respectively. At the Effective Time, each holder of a right received one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock at the Effective Time, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with the Merger, resulting in the issuance of 717,250 shares of Common Stock to holders of such rights. No fractional shares were issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration was paid at the Effective Time, as the consideration related thereto had been included in the original unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Company's Initial Public Offering or the concurrent private placement, as applicable. ​ August 2021 Private Placement On August 23, 2021, the Company completed a Private Placement and issued 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $ 11.00 per share and the Preferred Investment Options (warrants) to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $ 12.00 per share until they expire on August 23, 2024. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $ 30.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. In connection with the Private Placement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the purchasers of the Securities. The Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 to register the Securities became effective on September 15, 2021. Transaction costs incurred related to the Private Placement include the following: (i) placement fees of $ 2,250,000 (ii) issuance of Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent to purchase up to an aggregate of 136,364 shares with an exercise price of $ 13.75 per share and a three year term with a fair value of $ 1,026,957 , and (iii) legal, professional and printing fees of $ 391,781 . Preferred Investment Options (included in above warrants table) The form of the Preferred Investment Option is a warrant. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 13.78 , exercise price of $ 12.00 , term of three years , volatility of 85.9 %, risk-free rate of 0.43 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). The grant date fair value of these Preferred Investment Options was estimated to be $ 21,695,457 on August 23, 2021 and is reflected within additional paid-in capital as of September 30, 2021. As noted above, the Company issued fully vested Preferred Investment Options to the placement agent with an exercise price of $ 13.75 . As these Preferred Investment Options were issued for services provided in facilitating the Private Placement, the Company recorded the fair value of such Preferred Investment Options as a cost of capital on the issuance date. The measurement of fair value was determined utilizing a Black-Scholes model considering all relevant assumptions current at the date of issuance (i.e., share price of $ 13.78 , exercise price of $ 13.75 , term of three years , volatility of 85.9 %, risk-free rate of 0.43 %, and expected dividend rate of 0 %). ​ 11. Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that was subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . 25 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96 ), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former option. Each Substitute Option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16 ) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Option that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx option that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Option had the conversion of NeuroRx options into the Substitute Options been applied using the Exchange Ratio as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. As stated in the Merger Agreement, if any Substitute Options are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 5.10 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Options as a modification of the existing options. Incremental compensation costs, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified options over the fair value of the original options immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx options and Substitute Options was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Options Substitute Options ​ Strike price ​ ​ $ 1.00 -$ 72.30 ​ ​ $ 0.20 -$ 14.58 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % ​ Expected term ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ The Substitute Options contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash Mileston and/or Earnout Shares Milestone). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash Mileston or Earnout Shares Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at September 30, 2021. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Options subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. 26 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For vested Substitute Options, the Company recognized incremental compensation on the modification date totaling $ 1,014,640 of which $ 993,500 and $ 21,140 was recognized in General and Administrative and Research and Development, respectively, in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. For unvested Substitute Options, the Company will recognize incremental compensation over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date, taking into consideration the probability of the achievement of the Earnout Cash Milestone and/or Earnout Shares Milestone. Incremental compensation costs related to unvested Substitute Options as of the modification date was $ 25,877,473 . 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan At the Effective Time, the Company adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of September 30, 2021, 5,373,049 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan, inclusive of any shares of Common Stock subject to stock options, restricted stock awards or other awards that were assumed in the Merger and terminate as a result of being unexercised or are forfeited or repurchased by the Company, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2021 Plan equal to 5,373,049 shares of Common Stock. The Substitute Options do not reduce the number of shares authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan. As of September 30, 2021, 732,460 shares have been awarded and 4,640,589 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the FDA for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for settlement and services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying value of notes payable approximated the estimated fair values due to their recent issuances. 28 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and Earnout Cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements. The following table presents information about the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Description Level September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Warrant liabilities (Note 10) ​ 3 ​ $ 775,263 ​ $ — Earnout Cash liability (Note 4) 3 ​ $ 26,283,238 ​ $ — ​ Warrant liabilities The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value the Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. The significant unobservable inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liability that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, 2021 At Effective Time Stock price on valuation date ​ $ 9.27 ​ $ 11.62 ​ Exercise price per share ​ $ 11.50 ​ $ 11.50 ​ Expected life ​ 4.65 ​ 4.9 ​ Volatility ​ 85.9 % ​ 35.7 % ​ Risk-free rate ​ 0.9 % ​ 0.85 % ​ Dividend yield ​ — % — % Fair value of warrants ​ $ 5.69 ​ $ 3.78 ​ ​ A reconciliation of warrant liabilities is included below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2020 ​ $ — Additions pursuant to Merger ​ 1,983,674 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ( 1,468,649 ) Balance as of June 30, 2021 ​ ​ 515,025 Loss upon re-measurement ​ ​ 260,238 Balance as of September 30, 2021 ​ $ 775,263 ​ Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market, including the probability of achievement, and thus 29 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. A reconciliation of the Earnout Cash liability is included below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2020 ​ $ — Additions pursuant to Merger ​ 25,520,195 Loss upon re-measurement ​ 354,701 Balance as of June 30, 2021 ​ ​ 25,874,896 Loss upon re-measurement ​ ​ 408,342 Balance as of September 30, 2021 ​ $ 26,283,238 ​ Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares has been estimated using the trading price of our Common Stock at the Effective Time ($ 24.25 ), discounted based on the probability of the Earnout Shares Milestone being met as determined at the Effective Time, and thus represents a Level 2 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The contingent Earnout Shares, if achieved, would be issued to legacy NeuroRx shareholders. The Earnout Shares are a fixed number of shares to be issued to such shareholders on a pro rata basis. The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares were recognized as a deemed dividend. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares was $ 253,130,272 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $ 0 ). 13. Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the CARES Act to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, and modification to the net interest deduction limitations. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The Company continues to monitor any effects on its financial statements that may result from the CARES Act. Upon consummation of the Merger, a change in control was deemed to have occurred and the Company's net operating loss carrybacks could be subject to limitations. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of September 30, 2021. 14. Related Party Transactions All related party transactions are governed by and implemented in accordance with the Company’s Related Person Transactions Policy which relates to the review, approval, ratification and disclosure of transactions or arrangements 30 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS between the Company and its directors, executive officers and other related persons, All Related Person Transactions are submitted to the General Counsel of the Company and the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval. The Company licenses patents that are owned by Glytech, LLC (“Glytech”), pursuant to a license agreement (the “Glytech Agreement”). Glytech is owned by a co-founder and former Director of the Company, and therefore, a related party. The Glytech Agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. During the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company paid a co-founder $ 0 and $ 0 , respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, $ 125,000 and $ 82,569 , respectively, for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. These support services are ongoing. The Fourth Amendment to the Glytech Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2020, includes an equity value-triggered transfer of Excluded Technology from Glytech to NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Excluded Technology is defined in the Glytech Agreement as any technology, and any know-how related thereto, covered in the licensed patents that do not recite either D-cycloserine or lurasidone individually or jointly. This definition would cover pharmaceutical formulations, including some that NRx Pharmaceuticals considers “pipeline” or “future product” opportunities, that contain a combination of pharmaceutical components different from those contained in NRX-100 and NRX-101. The Excluded Technology will transfer to the Company for no additional consideration if aggregate the value of NRx Pharmaceuticals equity held by Glytech exceeds $50,000,000 on any date prior to August 6, 2022, based on the average daily value of the equity held by Glytech during a period of 20 consecutive days prior to such date. The Company believes the criteria have been met pending the registration of Glytech shares. The CEO of the Company is a major shareholder in the Company. Therefore, his services are deemed to be a related party transaction. He serves the company on a full-time basis and has an employment agreement with the Company and received compensation of $ 68,750 and $ 128,750 during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 355,000 and $ 250,625 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The services are ongoing. Zachary Javitt provides services related to website, IT, and marketing support under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Commercial Officer, who is responsible for assuring that the services are provided on financial terms that are at market. The Company paid this family member a total of $ 28,580 and $ 19,585 during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 58,320 and $ 60,355 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, the Company pays PillTracker for digital health product development required to track the use of Aviptadil in clinical trials. FDA guidance recommends such solutions and the FDA specifically directed the Company to implement a digital health tracking solution. Zachary Javitt and Jonathan Javitt are the chief executive officer and board chairman, respectively, of PillTracker. As PillTracker is a Related Person, all PillTracker agreements and transactions are submitted to the General Counsel of the Company and the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Related Person Transactions Policy. On July 26, 2021, the Company and PillTracker entered into a statement of work (“SOW”) under the Master Service Agreement dated April 1, 2020 (“MSA”). Under this SOW, PillTracker provides support for the inhaled ZYESAMI Phase 2/3 clinical trials by monitoring SP02 and Heart Rate in patients in a sub-study of the AVICOVID-2 clinical trial in the U.S. to determine the physiological effects of ZYESAMI vs. a placebo. PillTracker’s responsibilities include set-up, patient monitoring, and the provision of tablets and other necessary hardware. The total cost under the SOW is $ 157,110 . NRx Pharmaceuticals paid PillTracker $ 289,308 and $ 118,642 during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 685,066 and $ 118,642 during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 31 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition and plan of operations together with NRx Pharmaceuticals' unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (""BRPA""), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (“Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Unless the context suggests otherwises, references to “NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NeuroRx”, “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company” refer to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. ​ NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing NRX-101, the first investigational oral therapeutic for the treatment of Acute Suicidal Behavior/Ideation (ASIB) in Bipolar Disorder and Aviptadil (reformulated as ZYESAMI ® ), an investigational intravenous and inhaled drug to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19. The NRx Pharmaceuticals Antidepressant Regime was developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Prof. Daniel Javitt, PhD, MD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRx Pharmaceuticals Antidepressant Regime begins with a single dose of ketamine, an FDA approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed and investigated as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for acute suicidal crisis associated with bipolar depression. NRX-101 combines DCS, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from multiple Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a Phase 2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on the STABIL-B study ( www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the current standard of care) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. In March 2020, the Company initiated development of RLF-100 ZYESAMI in partnership with Relief Therapeutics through a collaboration agreement (“Relief Agreement”). ZYESAMI is based on 50 years of research, pioneered by Professor Sami Said, on the role of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide in preventing and treating acute lung injury by protecting the Type II cell in the lung. The rights to Dr. Said’s scientific work are licensed by the Company from the Research Foundation of the State University of New York. On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Relief for the clinical development and, if approved, the sale of Aviptadil. The collaboration agreement provides for funding by Relief of certain clinical trials, formulation and manufacturing of Aviptadil as well as establishing specified sales territories for each party and share of the profits in those territories for “Product” as defined in the collaboration agreement. Relief has reimbursed the Company approximately $10.9 million for expenses but has subsequently declined to reimburse the Company for additional costs of the IV clinical trial, the inhaled use trial, formulation and manufacture of ZYESAMI, statistical analysis, and regulatory 33 Table of Contents filings. The financial statements reflect $13.8 million in unreimbursed Research and Development costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, prior to the allocation of corporate overhead. Additional unreimbursed costs were reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company advised Relief that the Company is funding those costs with other capital. On October 6, 2021, Relief filed a lawsuit against the Company. See Contractual Obligations and Commitments below. In an open-label, single center trial at Houston Methodist Hospital, ZYESAMI demonstrated a statistically significant 9-fold advantage in probability of survival and recovery from respiratory failure compared to the standard of care among patients with COVID-19 Respiratory Failure. On June 1, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals reported phase IIb/III study results of ZYESAMI in patients with respiratory failure due to critical COVID-19. The study failed to meet its primary endpoint of being alive and free of respiratory failure at day 60 without controlling for ventilation status or site of care (i.e. tertiary care hospital vs. community hospital), but did demonstrate a statistically significant increase in the likelihood that patients treated with ZYESAMI would be alive and free of respiratory failure at 60 days, compared to those treated with placebo when controlling for ventilation status and site of care. The clinical study did demonstrate a 2-fold, statistically-significant increased odds of surviving COVID-19 respiratory failture across all patients and sites of care when controlling for baseline severity of COVID-19 in each patient. This survival endpoint was a declared secondary endpoint of the clinical trial. In November 2021, the FDA declined the Company’s application for Emergency Use Authorization for ZYESAMI. The Company continues to provide the FDA with new data from ongoing trials as such data become available and the FDA has stated that it remains committed to working with the Company on the development of ZYESAMI. ​ The Company expects to file a new drug application (NDA) based on the recently completed Phase 2b/3 clinical trial and additional clinical trials currently underway, including the National Institutes of Health ACTIV3b/TESICO trial (NCT 04843761). The Company plans to file for accelerated approval of ZYESAMI based on the IL-6 and RDR data in the two clinical studies. If granted approval, ZYESAMI would be the first medicine in the United States indicated specifically for patients suffering from critical COVID-19 with respiratory failure. In July 2021, the nation of Georgia issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for intravenous ZYESAMI (Aviptadil) for the treatment of critical COVID-19. Pursuant to this EUA, the Company has sent a team of physicians to Georgia to train local doctors to appropriately administer ZYESAMI and the effects of the medicine. The supply of intravenous doses by the Company is being discussed with the Georgia Ministry of Health and with the Ministries of Health of other nations in the Caucasus region. On October 8, 2021, the Company submitted an updated manufacturing module to its FDA Investigational New Drug file documenting this change in manufacture and stability. On November 8, 2021, the FDA communicated with the Company that the manufacturing update had been reviewed and that no “clinical hold” items had been identified (this is the regulatory language that allows an investigational product to be given to patients). The Company initiated a parallel manufacturing process to conform to EU and UK standards. In October 2021, the Company announced that a European Qualified Person audit was conducted and no major deficiencies were identified, thus clearing ZYESAMI’s use in EU investigational programs. Although the initial focus has been on the use of intravenous ZYESAMI, the Company has received permission from the FDA to test inhaled ZYESAMI in a phase 2/3 clinical trial for patients with early COVID-19 disease. The Company believes that the inhaled medicine will be more convenient for patients to self-administer than the intravenous drug, provided patients are still able to inhale normally and do not have inflammatory debris clogging the alveoli. This clinical trial commenced in January 2021 and is expected to conclude in the first half of 2022. On July 11, 2021, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Israel. The MoU allows for the Company to hold an exclusive, worldwide license to develop the BriLife TM vaccine, a novel COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR). The vaccine is a self-propagating live virus vaccine based on World Health Organization sponsored research that resulted in the development of a successful vaccine against Ebola. The vaccine has demonstrated a statistically significant increase in COVID-neutralizing antibody (a sign of immunity to SARS-CoV-2) compared to placebo in phase 2a trials conducted in Israel. The vaccine has further shown indications of neutralizing antibody against variants of concern, including the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 34 Table of Contents early human and preclinical studies. The Company is commencing a registration trial of the vaccine in the nations of Georgia, Ukraine, Israel and additional countries. The IIBR will provide technical assistance for the clinical trial. The Company has contracted with a GMP Viral Vector manufacturing partner to scale up the vaccine manufacturing. If the BriLife clinical trials are successful, and subject to the negotiation of definitive licensing agreements with the IIBR, the Company would have an exclusive license to commercialize the vaccine in exchange for agreed upon milestone and royalty payments. Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals’ net loss was $20,773,099 and $5,161,712, respectively.

COVID-19 Outbreak On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 Outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 Outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. Aside from our COVID-19 related trials, as a result of the COVID-19 Outbreak most of our other trials have been halted. Except as otherwise discussed in the preceding sentence and otherwise in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes or impact of COVID-19 on our business. However, the full impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak continues to evolve as of the date hereof. If the COVID-19 Outbreak continues, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. ​ Components of Results of Operations Operating expenses Research and development expenses NRx Pharmaceuticals’ research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with NRx Pharmaceuticals’ clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and equity-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts.

Until such time as NRx Pharmaceuticals is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of ZYESAMI will commence in the near term or that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations. Reverse Recapitalization Merger and Subsequent Equity Issuances Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. At September 30, 2021, the fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated to be $26,283,238. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $253,130,272 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $0). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $88,837,121. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date. The Company received $8,100,000 in net proceeds after transaction costs. NRx Pharmaceuticals expects to continue to incur operating losses and net cash outflows until such time as it generates a level of revenue from sale or licensing of drug products to support its cost structure. There is no assurance that NRx Pharmaceuticals will achieve profitable operations and if achieved, whether it will be sustained on a continued basis. NRx Pharmaceuticals intends to fund ongoing activities by raising additional capital through equity or debt financings. There can be no assurance that NRx Pharmaceuticals will be successful in raising that additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to NRx Pharmaceuticals. If NRx Pharmaceuticals is unable to raise 39 Table of Contents sufficient additional capital, NRx Pharmaceuticals may be compelled to reduce the scope of its operations and planned capital expenditures.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, financing activities provided $2,268,630 of cash, primarily resulting from $1,589,103 of proceeds from the issuance of shares of NRx Pharmaceuticals common and preferred stock and $629,523 of proceeds from notes payable. Contractual Obligations and Commitments See Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to NRx Pharmaceuticals’ unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2021 included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of NRx Pharmaceuticals' commitments and contingencies. Milestone Payments Pursuant to the legal settlement with Sarah Herzog Memorial Hospital Ezrat Nashim (“SHMH”) in September 2018, which included the license of intellectual property rights from SHMH, an ongoing royalty of 1% to 2.5% of NRX-101 gross sales shall be due to SHMH, together with milestone payments of $250,000, upon completion of phase 3 trials and commercial sale of NRX-101. The milestone payments for developmental and commercial milestones range from $100,000 to $750,000. Annual maintenance fees range up to $150,000. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements NRx Pharmaceuticals is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. NRx Pharmaceuticals has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates NRx Pharmaceuticals' management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the valuation of conversion features of convertible notes and common stock, the valuation of stock options and warrants and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. Fair value of common and preferred stock Prior to the Merger, in order to determine the fair value of shares of its common stock, the Company's board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of its common stock and preferred stock based on arms-length transactions with third party investors. Subsequent to the Merger, the Board determines the fair value of the Common Stock based on the closing market price on the date of grant. 41 Table of Contents Share-based compensation Our stock-based awards are classified as equity (stock options and warrants). We recognize related share-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the awards. We estimate the fair value of all stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model which requires the use of subjective assumptions that could materially impact the estimation of fair value and related compensation expense to be recognized. One of these assumptions include the expected volatility of our stock price. Developing this assumption requires the use of judgment. The Company, both prior to and after the Merger, lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. We also estimate the fair value of our common stock based on third party sales of our common stock Warrant liability We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach. Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market, including probability of achievement, and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. This liability is most sensitive to change based on progress of clinical trials, results of such trials, ability to complete the patent application process, assessment of likelihood of approval from the FDA and United States Patent Office, and remaining time to December 31, 2022. ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of 42 Table of Contents the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms . (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has added resources to its accounting department and implemented a number of process changes to increase the overall control environment as a result of being a public company. ​ PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. On October 6, 2021, Relief filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming that the Company failed to honor its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. Relief’s complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. We believe that the claims are baseless and without merit. However, the parties to the lawsuit have agreed to engage in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation and have agreed to hold a mediation in early January 2022. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute significant counterclaims against Relief. We may become involved in various legal actions incidental to our business. As of the date of this report, we are not involved in any other legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Relief Therapeutics has filed a complaint against us regarding the implementation of our Collaboration Agreement. We entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Relief (the “Collaboration Agreement”) on September 18, 2020. The Collaboration Agreement provided that Relief had the right to fund development costs related to Aviptadil for respiratory diseases in exchange for a predetermined division of profits and we had the right to continue its development program with other investor funds should Relief not provide funding. Shortly following the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, however, a number of disputes arose between Relief and the Company, including with respect to the scope of clinical trials of Aviptadil for treatment of COVID-19 respiratory failure and the stability of the original formulation for Aviptadil. In February 2021, Relief ceased funding further development of Aviptadil for treatment of COVID-19 and has refused to fund clinical trials for its inhaled use. Furthermore, Relief has not funded the cost of reformulation necessary to develop a shelf stable product (reformulation as ZYESAMI). On October 6, 2021, Relief filed a complaint in New York State Court, claiming that we failed to honor our obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. Relief’s complaint seeks several remedies, including damages for alleged breaches of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. We believe that the claims are baseless and without merit. However, the parties to the lawsuit have agreed to engage in an effort to amicably resolve the litigation and have agreed to hold a mediation in early January 2022. If the mediation does not resolve the dispute, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously and to prosecute significant counterclaims against Relief. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully resolve the dispute through mediation or that, in the event the dispute continues in litigation, that we will be successful in our opposition to Relief’s claims. In the event of an adverse ruling, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to pay damages in an amount that may have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects. We are no longer a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules of Nasdaq. However, during the applicable phase-in periods we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance standards, which limit the presence of independent directors on our Board of Directors or committees of the Board of Directors. Previously, Jonathan Javitt and Daniel Javitt controlled the votes of the majority of our common stock. As a result, we were a “controlled company” for purposes of the Nasdaq corporate governance rules and were exempt from certain governance requirements otherwise required by Nasdaq, including requirements that we have a nominating and corporate 43 Table of Contents governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities . We are no longer a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules of Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq listing requirements, a company that ceases to be a “controlled company” must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees no later than the following phase-in schedule: (1) one independent committee member at the time it ceases to be a controlled company, (2) a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of the date it ceases to be a controlled company and (3) all independent committee members within one year of the date it ceases to be a controlled company. Additionally, the Nasdaq listing requirements provide a 12-month phase-in period from the date a company ceases to be a “controlled company” to comply with the majority independent board requirement. At this time, the majority of our directors are independent, as are a majority of the members of each of our committees while the nominating and corporate governance committee is not made up solely of independent directors. Until we are fully subject to these requirements, however, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq. ​ Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (b) Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock On July 12, 2021, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-257438) was declared effective (“Registration Statement”). We filed the Registration Statement to permit certain holders of the shares of our Common Stock to resell such shares (the “Selling Securityholders”). We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Securityholders. We also registered the issuance of an aggregate of 3,586,250 shares of our Common Stock upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. We will receive the proceeds from any exercise of warrants for cash. We intend to use the proceeds from the exercise of warrants for cash for general corporate, funding of clinical trial programs and working capital purposes. On August 23, 2021, the Company completed a Private Placement and issued 2,727,273 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of $11.00 per share and the Preferred Investment Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,727,273 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $12.00 per share until they expire on August 23, 2024. (collectively, the “Securities”) The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately $30,000,000, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. In connection with the Private Placement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the purchasers of the Securities. The Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 to register the Securities was declared effective on September 15, 2021. Item 5. Other Information. None. ​ ​ 44 Table of Contents Item 6.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization The Business On May 24, 2021, we consummated the business combination, or the Business Combination, contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 13, 2020, by and among our company (formerly known as Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (“BRPA”)), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), Big Rock Merger Corp., and a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Big Rock Merger Corp. was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (“Merger”). As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name to NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals,” “NRXP,” “we,” or the “Company”), with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Company is a clinical-stage small molecule pharmaceutical company which develops novel therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and life-threatening pulmonary diseases through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, NeuroRx. On September 21, 2020, we announced a commercial partnership with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG (“Relief”) for global commercialization of RLF-100 (aviptadil acetate) (now reformulated as ZYESAMI TM ), an FDA Fast Track-designated, investigational, pre-commercial drug for COVID-19 related respiratory failure (the “NRx COVID-19 Drug”). The partnership affords Relief the right to fund all formulations and clinical development of aviptadil for treatment of respiratory disease, in exchange for a predetermined share of profits. An application for emergency use authorization (“EUA”) for this product candidate is pending before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In addition, ZYESAMI TM has received EUA in the nation of Georgia. We are also developing NRX-100/101, an FDA Breakthrough Therapy-designated, investigational, pre-commercial drug for treating bipolar depression in patients with acute suicidal ideation and behavior (the “NRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen”). The Company has been granted exclusive worldwide development rights to a new potential COVID-19 vaccine called BriLife pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Israel. The Company is commencing a clinical trial of the BriLife vaccine in the nation of Georgia. If the Georgia clinical trial, and other clinical trials running in Israel are successful, the Company expects to enter into a long-term royalty-bearing licensing agreement for the commercialization of the vaccine. 2. Liquidity As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $ 13,386,332 in cash. Since inception the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each fiscal year. The Company has no revenues and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable. The Company is dependent on its ability to continue to raise equity and/or debt financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. The Company has a collaboration agreement with Relief which provided for funding by Relief of certain research and development expenses related to the U.S. development of ZYESAMI TM and the portion of corporate overhead attributable to that program. The proceeds received amounted to $ 771,244 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, Relief has declined to reimburse the Company for any additional expenses related to the IV clinical trials for the ZYESAMI TM . The IV clinical trials for the ZYESAMI TM were completed on February 24, 2021. Subsequent to June 30, 2021, the Company received $ 9,186,316 from the exercise of a warrant for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares of common stock. Accordingly, the Company believes that it currently has sufficient funds to support operations through the next twelve months from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company cannot make any assurances that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact the Company’s business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of the Company’s operations. 8 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COVID-19 Outbreak On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 Outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 Outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. If the COVID-19 Outbreak continues, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2021 and beyond. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 Outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the year ending December 31, 2021 and beyond. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as determined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the balances and results for the periods presented. The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. The merger between Merger Sub and NeuroRx was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the “Reverse Recapitalization”). Under this method of accounting, BRPA was treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Reverse Recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. NeuroRx was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the following predominant factors: The consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations prior to the Reverse Recapitalization are those of NeuroRx. The shares and corresponding capital amounts and losses per share, prior to the Merger, have been retroactively restated based on shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Merger. 9 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in its financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the valuation of common and preferred stock, stock options, warrants, contingent consideration and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected. Certain Risks and Uncertainties The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the risk of failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company’s business plan. The Company is subject to risks that are common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, reliance on third party manufacturers, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements , provides guidance on the development and disclosure of fair value measurements. Under this accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The accounting guidance classifies fair value measurements in one of the following three categories for disclosure purposes: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and values determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. (Refer to Note 12) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consist of balances due from collaborative partners. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated, and specific partner issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 5,470,897 as the Company does not expect to collect on amounts due to the Company owed from Relief. 10 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk Cash is the only financial instrument that is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company’s cash is deposited in accounts at large financial institutions, and amounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the cash is held. The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk of loss. Research and Development Costs The Company’s research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the Company’s clinical trials, salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received. Stock-Based Compensation The Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based awards with graded-vesting schedules are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. All stock-based compensation costs are recorded in general and administrative or research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations based upon the underlying individual’s role at the Company. Modification of stock options and warrants A change in any of the terms or conditions of stock options and warrants is accounted for as a modification. Incremental stock-based compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified option over the fair value of the original option/warrant immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the ordinary shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested stock options and warrants to board members, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested stock options, we recognize over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date. If the fair value of the modified option is lower than the fair value of the original option immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award. The accounting for incremental fair value of warrants is based on the specific facts and circumstances related to the modification which may result in a reduction of additional paid-in capital, recognition of costs for services rendered, or recognized as a deemed dividend. Warrants The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which 11 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach (see Notes 10 and 12). Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit would more likely than not be realized assuming examination by the taxing authority. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share excludes, when applicable, the potential impact of stock options, common stock warrant shares, and other dilutive instruments because their effect would be anti-dilutive in the periods in which we incur a net loss.

This guidance removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC 740. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and it also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and adoption must be as of the beginning of the Company’s annual fiscal year. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption. In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchange of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options , which provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as (1) an adjustment to equity and, if so, the related earnings per share (EPS) effects, if any, or (2) an expense and, if so, the manner and pattern of recognition. The amendments in this ASU are effective January 1, 2022, including interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2021-04 effective January 1, 2021. ​ 4. Reverse Recapitalization As discussed in Note 1, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), BRPA closed the Business Combination with NeuroRx, as a result of which NeuroRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRPA. While BRPA was the legal acquirer of NeuroRx in the business combination, for accounting purposes, the Merger is treated as a Reverse Recapitalization, whereby NeuroRx is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the historical financial statements of NeuroRx became the historical financial statements of BRPA (renamed NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) upon the closing of the Merger. Under this method of accounting, BRPA was treated as the “acquired” company and NeuroRx is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of NeuroRx issuing stock for the net assets of BRPA, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of BRPA were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. 13 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of NeuroRx at the Closing Date consists of 50,000,000 shares (“Closing Consideration”) of BRPA common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share (“Common Stock”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of NeuroRx common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share, and each share of the NeuroRx convertible preferred stock that was convertible into a share of NeuroRx common stock at a one-to-one ratio pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation, was converted into Common Stock equal to 3.16 (the “Exchange Ratio”). Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option or warrant to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Substitute Options” and the “Substitute Warrants,” respectively), based on an exchange ratio of 4.96 :1 (the “Option Exchange Ratio”), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the original instrument. In addition, the securityholders of NeuroRx (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time received the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock, including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of outstanding shares of NeuroRx preferred stock (as calculated pursuant to the NeuroRx certificate of incorporation), immediately prior to the Effective Time, was converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the Closing Consideration and the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”), of which 935,608 and 1,920,492 are subject to the terms and conditions of the Substitute Options and Substitute Warrants, if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $ 100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five ( 5 ) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. The Earnout Cash Milestone was recognized as a contingent liability and measured at an estimated fair value at the Closing Date and will be each period end thereafter until earned or December 31, 2022 (see Note 12). The Earnout Shares Milestone was recognized in equity and, upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $ 253,130,272 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend (see Note 12). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately 22,209,280 shares and $ 88,837,121 . In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option and Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Option or Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying such option or warrant had the conversion of the legacy NeuroRx option and warrants into the Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio (3.16:1). If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option and Warrant will be 14 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held in escrow pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options or Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option or warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option or warrant holder. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $ 10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $ 10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date.

Convertible Notes Payable On February 12, 2020, a Qualified Financing Event (as defined below) occurred when the Company received cumulative investment proceeds in excess of $ 10,000,000 from the sale and issuance of common shares. The fair value of the Company’s common shares was $ 10.63 per share. The 2017 Notes (as defined below) and the 2018 Notes (as defined below) in the aggregate principal amount of $ 2,800,000 were converted into 1,005,458 common shares (at the discounted price of $ 2.78 per share), and the related unpaid and accrued interest totaling $ 369,660 were also converted into 132,739 common shares of the Company (at the discounted price of $ 2.78 per share). Additionally, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment for the difference between the carrying value of the convertible notes, unamortized debt discount, and the value of the embedded put option and the fair value of the common shares of $ 0 and $ 306,641 during the three months 16 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ended and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The Company issued the shares of common stock pursuant to this conversion on September 23, 2020. 2017 Convertible Notes Payable On November 16, 2017 and November 19, 2017, the Company issued convertible notes (“2017 Notes”), as amended for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 2,500,000 . The 2017 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 % per annum and principal and interest were due and payable four years from the date of issuance. Upon either a sale of the Company’s assets or all of its capital stock, or a change of control, the principal balance would double and be repaid. Upon closing of either a sale of the Company’s shares for at least $ 10,000,000 or a public offering of the Company’s securities (“Qualified Financing Event”), the outstanding principal balance will be converted into the number of such securities sold at a conversion price equal to 80% of the securities negotiated share price . 2018 Convertible Notes Payable On January 5, 2018 and April 25, 2018, the Company issued convertible notes (“2018 Notes”), as amended for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 300,000 . The 2018 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6 % per annum and were due and payable four years from the date of issuance. Upon either a sale of the Company’s assets or all of its capital stock, or a change of control, the principal balance would double and be repaid. Upon closing of either a sale of the Company’s shares for at least $ 10,000,000 or a public offering of the Company’s securities (“Qualified Financing Event”), the outstanding principal balance will be converted into the number of such securities sold at a conversion price equal to 80% of the securities negotiated share price. The January 5, 2018 note for $ 100,000 was not amended and interest was unpaid, as such, that note and related accrued interest were classified as current liabilities. The April 25, 2018 note for $ 200,000 was amended similar to the 2017 Notes to accrue interest and to be paid at maturity with the principal. The proceeds received upon issuing the 2017 Notes and 2018 Notes were first allocated to the fair value of the embedded put with the remainder to the debt host instrument. The Company recognized a loss of $ 0 and $ 0 during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 0 and $ 27,160 during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to the estimated increase in fair value of the embedded put. The discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt. The Company amortized debt discount of $ 0 to interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and $ 0 and $ 16,454 during the six months ended June 30,2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company paid no interest during the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 8. Notes Payable Note Payable -- Related Party On July 1, 2019, the Company converted certain accounts payable into a loan (the “Note Payable — Related Party”) with a related party in the amount of $ 154,190 . The loan, in the form of a promissory note, matures on July 1, 2020. The principal amount of the loan and any accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and payable beginning July 1, 2019. All payments shall be applied first to accrued but unpaid interest, and then to outstanding principal. If not sooner paid, the entire remaining indebtedness (including accrued interest) shall be due and payable on July 1, 2020. The loan bears interest, compounded daily, at 6 % annual interest. The loan continues to accrue interest as it was not paid off upon maturity. Relief Therapeutics Loan On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Relief Therapeutics (the “Relief Therapeutics Loan”) in the amount of $ 500,000 . The loan matures on April 6, 2022 and bears interest at 2 % per annum payable in arrears. 17 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Paycheck Protection Program Loan On April 28, 2020, the Company received $ 119,842 in loan funding from the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP Loan”), established pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The unsecured PPP Loan accrues interest on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1 % per annum, and there is a six month deferment period until equal installment payments of $6,744 of principal and interest are due. The term of the PPP Loan is two years . To the extent the loan amount is not forgiven under the PPP, the Company is obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest, beginning seven months from the date of the Note, until the maturity date. The Loan amount may be eligible for forgiveness pursuant to (1) at least 75% of the loan proceeds are used to cover payroll costs and the remainder is used for mortgage interest, rent and utility costs over the eight week period after the loan is made, and (2) the number of employees and compensation levels are generally maintained. Forgiveness of the loan is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on future adherence to the forgiveness criteria. The Company used the entire PPP Loan for qualifying payroll expenses, and filed for loan forgiveness on December 30, 2020. The Company received full forgiveness of all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the PPP Loan as of February 11, 2021. The forgiveness of the PPP Loan qualified for debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments , and as a result, the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was written off in the amount of $ 119,842 and $ 968 , respectively, and the Company recorded a gain on extinguishment totaling $ 120,810 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The following table summarizes the Company's outstanding notes payable as of the respective periods. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, December 31, ​ ​ 2021 ​ 2020 ​ ​ (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ Note Payable — Related Party ​ $ 154,190 ​ $ 154,190 Relief Therapeutics Loan ​ 500,000 ​ 500,000 Paycheck Protection Program Loan ​ — ​ 119,842 Carrying value of notes payable ​ 654,190 ​ 774,032 Accrued interest ​ ​ 31,976 ​ ​ 22,656 Note payable ​ ​ 686,166 ​ ​ 796,688 Notes payable and accrued interest, current ​ $ 173,694 ​ $ 248,861 Notes payable and accrued interest, non-current ​ $ 512,472 ​ $ 547,827 ​ ​ 9. Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease The Company leases office space on a month-to-month basis. The rent expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $ 48,776 and $ 9,087 , respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $ 55,393 and $ 17,902 , respectively. Sponsored Research Agreement with National Jewish Health On February 8 2021, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“Research Agreement”) with National Jewish Health (“NJ Health”), a Colorado not-for-profit institution. Under the terms of the Research Agreement, NRx Pharmaceuticals agreed to sponsor a research study at NJ Health relating to the impact of NRx Pharmaceuticals' Aviptadil on propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in alveolar type II cells in vitro (the “Study”). In return for performance of the Study under the Research Agreement, NRx Pharmaceuticals has committed to pay NJ Health approximately $ 360,450 . During 18 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals paid NJ Health $ 0 and $ 126,157 , respectively, of the total committed amount. Aviptadil Manufacturing, Production, Supply and Distribution Agreements On August 25, 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals and Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Nephron”) signed an agreement for the manufacturing of finished pharmaceutical product of Aviptadil intravenous formulation and the development of an inhaled (nebulizer) formulation of Aviptadil. Nephron will serve as the exclusive and primary supplier of the product for both clinical and commercial purposes, supplying 100 % of the Company’s annual requirements. The Company has agreed to purchase products from Nephron for a fixed price. On September 29, 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals and Cardinal Health signed an exclusive distribution agreement, as well as a 3rd party logistics agreement on October 1, 2020. Cardinal Health will manage warehousing, distribution, invoicing for the potential sale of Aviptadil in the United States and Puerto Rico. On October 9, 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals signed an agreement with Polypeptide for the supply of GMP grade Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) Aviptadil (VIP). This gives NRx Pharmaceuticals a second source of procuring API. The Company has agreed to purchase a total of $ 1,010,000 worth of product and services over the contract. On January 4, 2021 NRx Pharmaceuticals and Aerogen Limited (“Aerogen”) signed a supply agreement for the supply of certain products, including the Aerogen Solo Nebulizer System and Aerogen Ultra, solely for the purposes of carrying out clinical trials relating to inhalation delivery of Aviptadil for treatment of pulmonary insufficiency and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. Pill Tracker is an agent of NRx Pharmaceuticals per the supply agreement (see Note 14). Relief Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Relief for the clinical development and if approved the sale of Aviptadil. The collaboration provides for funding by Relief of certain clinical trials. If such candidate is approved by the FDA, the Company shall receive 50% of net product profits from the product sales in the NRx Pharmaceuticals territory, which includes the United States, Canada, and Israel; 15% of net product profits from the product sales in the Relief Therapeutics territory, which includes the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, the UK, the Channel Islands, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra, Malta, San Marino, and Vatican City; and 20% of net product profits from the product sales in all other countries. During 2021, the Company invoiced Relief $ 5,984,679 for reimbursable expenses and received $ 770,444 in payments from Relief for these reimbursable expenses. The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 5,470,897 as of June 30, 2021, due to the fact that the Company does not expect to receive payment for the remaining invoices, thus fully reserving for the accounts receivable balance. As of the date of this filing, Relief has reimbursed NRx Pharmaceuticals $ 10,904,065 for expenses, but has subsequently declined to pay approximately $ 6 million in invoiced costs associated with conduct of the IV clinical trial, reformulation, and manufacture of ZYESAMI TM . Relief has additionally declined to fund the costs of the inhaled trial. NRx Pharmaceuticals advised Relief that NRx Pharmaceuticals is funding those costs with other capital. NRx Pharmaceuticals further advised Relief in December 2020 that the formulation data provided to NRx Pharmaceuticals as part of the collaboration agreement was non-reproducible. Relief subsequently issued a public disclosure acknowledging that Relief knew about the stability problems at the time of the collaboration agreement. Relief declined to fund the development of a stable formulation. Share Subscription Facility Agreement — GEM NeuroRx previously entered into a share subscription facility agreement (“GEM Agreement”) with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (collectively, referred to as “GEM”) with a three-year term. Subject to the successful listing of the shares of NeuroRx on an Exchange (any nationally recognized stock exchange or exchange platform in the world on which the Company will list its shares), GEM grants NeuroRx an option to require GEM to subscribe for shares from the Company for up to an aggregate value of approximately $ 95.6 million. The agreement also 19 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS included certain provisions which would not meet the U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. If NeuroRx was listed or completes a private transaction which results in a change of control of the Company, NeuroRx would issue GEM a warrant and pay a commitment fee of $ 1.9 million. Absent a listing of NeuroRx shares or a private transaction with a change of control during the three-year term, NeuroRx would have no obligations under the agreement. The reverse merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement would not have resulted in a listing of NeuroRx shares or a change in control. In November 2020, GEM introduced NeuroRx to BRPA. To resolve uncertainties around the application of the GEM Agreement post-Merger, NeuroRx and GEM agreed in March 2021 to issue a warrant to GEM and for the parties to use their good faith efforts to amend the GEM Agreement to meet U.S. requirements to issue registered shares. The warrant is not conditional upon any further events or completion of the merger. The warrant was issued March 28, 2021, for 3,329,812 shares of NeuroRx common stock at an exercise price of $ 3.19 per share (the “GEM Warrant”) and the parties agreed that GEM would immediately partially exercise the warrant for the purchase of 1,496,216 shares (“Initial Exercised Shares”) for $ 7,500,018 . The GEM Warrant will be valid for a period of three years from the date NeuroRx’s stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or consummation of a reverse merger transaction of the type contemplated by the Merger Agreement. This contingent liability at December 31, 2020, represented an obligation that resulted in the issuance of certain equity at a discounted per share price. As the amount was deemed probable and estimable at December 31, 2020, NeuroRx recorded a liability of $ 39,486,139 to reflect the fair value of the GEM Warrant. On March 28, 2021, NeuroRx recorded additional settlement liability of $ 21,365,641 to reflect the change in the fair value of the Company’s common stock. On March 28, 2021, NeuroRx reclassed the settlement liability to equity upon the issuance of the GEM Warrant. NeuroRx was required to register the Initial Exercised Shares on (a) the same registration statement on Form S-4 (or such other registration statement, if changed) in connection with the Merger, or (b) such other registration statement in connection with any other transaction which results in a public listing of NeuroRx. In addition, no later than 90 days following the consummation of the Big Rock merger, the Company was required to file with the SEC a registration statement to register under the Securities Act the resale by GEM of all shares issuable under the GEM Warrant other than the Initial Exercised Shares, which was filed with the Company's S-1 in July 2021. The GEM Warrant also includes “piggyback” registration rights. Subsequent to June 30, 2021, GEM exercised the remaining GEM Warrant for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares (adjusted for the Merger, discussed in Note 10) for gross proceeds to the Company of $ 9,186,316 and the GEM Warrant was extinguished. 10. Equity Common Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value $ 0.001 . As discussed in Note 4, we have retroactively adjusted the shares issued and outstanding prior to May 24, 2021 to give effect to the Exchange Ratio established in the Merger Agreement to determine the number of shares of common stock into which they were converted. The Company sold 65,526 and 0 shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and received gross proceeds of $ 1,436,274 and $ 0 , respectively. The Company sold 398,647 and 50,844 shares of common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and received gross proceeds of $ 8,363,132 and $ 176,990 , respectively. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BRPA and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters of BRPA’s initial public offering (“EBC”), entered into an amendment (“BCMA Amendment Agreement”) to the Business 20 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Combination Marketing Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2017 (“BCMA”), by and between BRPA and EBC. The BCMA Amendment Agreement provided that, in lieu of the cash fee payable to EBC pursuant to the BCMA, BRPA will issue to EBC at the Effective Time an aggregate of 200,000 shares of Common Stock and the BCMA (as amended by the BCMA Amendment Agreement) will terminate immediately following the Effective Time. The Company recognized the fair value of the 200,000 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the BCMA of $ 4,850,000 within general and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. Preferred Stock Upon closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value $ 0.001 . Series A, B-1, and B-1A Preferred Stock Prior to the Merger, the Company had authorized and issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, 1,050,695 shares of Series B-1 convertible preferred stock, and 316,848 shares of Series B-1A convertible preferred stock, par value of $ 0.001 per share, which was convertible into one share of common stock for each preferred share (collectively, the “Preferred Stock”) at any time, at the option of the holder. The Preferred Stock were not redeemable and the related stockholders were entitled to a subordinated liquidation preference should NeuroRx liquidate or wind up operations. The preferences also included voting rights on an as-converted basis, ride-along rights, and an anti-dilution provision. The liquidation preference was $ 1.00 per share for the Series A convertible preferred stock, $ 7.58 per share for the Series B-1 convertible preferred stock, and $ 6.82 per share for the Series B-1A convertible preferred stock, plus any declared but unpaid dividends. Upon an initial public offering or merger under certain conditions the Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock. On May 24, 2021, pursuant to the Merger (as described in Note 4), 2,367,543 outstanding shares of Preferred Stock were automatically converted into 7,480,836 shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio. Series B-2 Preferred Stock In 2020, the Company authorized the issuance of 100,000 shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “B-2 Preferred Stock”), par value of $ 0.001 per share, convertible into one share of common stock for each share of B-2 Preferred Stock held. In March 2020, 4,167 shares of B-2 Preferred Stock were issued. The B-2 Preferred stock were not redeemable and the related stockholders were entitled to a subordinated liquidation preference should NeuroRx liquidate or wind up operations. The preferences also included voting rights on an as-converted basis, ride-along rights, and an anti-dilution provision. The liquidation preference was $ 12.00 per share plus any declared but unpaid dividends. The B-2 Preferred Stock could be converted into one share of common stock (subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalization) at any time, at the option of the holder. Upon an initial public offering or merger under certain conditions the B-2 Preferred Stock automatically converted into common stock. On May 24, 2021, pursuant to the Merger (as described in Note 4), 4,167 outstanding shares of B-2 Preferred stock were automatically converted into 13,168 shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio. Common Stock Warrants On March 28, 2021, NeuroRx issued 3,329,812 fully vested common stock warrants, exercisable at a per share price of $ 3.19 until they expire on March 27, 2024 to GEM (See Note 8). The fair value on the date of issuance was $ 60,851,779 . Upon issuance, 1,496,216 warrants were immediately exercised generating gross proceeds of $ 7,500,018 . Subsequent to June 30, 2021, GEM exercised the remaining GEM Warrant for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares for gross proceeds of $ 9,186,316 and the GEM Warrant was extinguished. 21 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The grant date fair value of common stock warrants is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company estimates its expected stock volatility based on historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies. The estimated fair value of common stock is based on sales to third parties. The following assumptions were used during the following periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, December 31, ​ 2021 ​ 2020 Strike price ​ $ 24.25 $ 3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % ​ 80.0 % Risk-free rate ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % ​ 0.19 %- 0.28 % Expected term ​ 0.57 - 4.42 ​ 3.00 - 5.00 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ Substitute Warrants In connection with the Merger, each warrant of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Warrants, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former warrant. Each Substitute Warrant will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx warrant multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Warrant will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Warrant that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx warrant that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Warrant, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Warrant and the aggregate intrinsic value of each adjusted Substitute Warrant will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Warrant had the conversion of NeuroRx warrants into the Substitute Warrants been applied using the Exchange Ratio (3.16:1) as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Warrant will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. If any Substitute Warrants are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Warrants. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the warrant holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the warrant holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx warrants became warrants to purchase an aggregate 4,909,066 shares of the Company’s common stock with an average exercise price of $ 2.50 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Warrants as a modification of the existing warrants. Incremental fair value, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified warrants over the fair value of the original warrants immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent 22 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx warrants and Substitute Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Warrants Substitute Warrants Strike price ​ $ 7.58 -$ 15.84 ​ $ 1.53 -$ 3.19 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % 80.0 % Risk-free rate ​ 0.03 %- 0.32 % 0.03 %- 0.32 % Expected term ​ 0.57 - 4.42 ​ 0.57 - 4.42 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ With respect to warrants held by certain members of our Board of Directors, the Substitute Warrants were determined to be within the scope of ASC 718 and were fully vested at the Effective Date. Further, the Substitute Warrants were determined to contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash or Earnout Share Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at June 30, 2021. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Warrants subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. The Company recognized incremental compensation on the modification date totaling $ 2,330,572 which was recognized in General and administrative in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Unamortized compensation costs related to performance-based vesting conditions of the Substitute Warrants as of the modification date was $ 23,760,993 . With respect to the remaining outstanding warrants, the incremental fair value of the Substitute Warrants of $ 2,691,799 was recognized as a deemed dividend as the Company concluded there is a transfer of value from the common shareholders to the holders of the Substitute Warrants as the change in the number of underlying shares and the decreased exercise price would result in the common shareholders becoming more diluted if and when the Substitute Warrants are converted. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the modification date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $ 0 ). Further, in the event the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestones are met, the Company will recognized an additional deemed dividend of $ 24,379,657 and $ 3,068,732 , respectively, if and when such conditions are met. Assumed Public Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 3,450,000 Public Warrants. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. The Public Warrants became exercisable at the effective time (May 24, 2021) and expire five years after the Effective Time or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: 23 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Certain of the above conditions have not been met to redeem the Public Warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. Assumed Placement Warrants Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 136,250 Placement Warrants. The Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common shares in the manner contemplated by ASC 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. The Company classifies the Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in its Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021. The Company measures the fair value of the warrants at the end of each reporting period and recognizes changes in the fair value from the prior period in the Company’s operating results for the current period. The Company recognized a gain on the change in fair value of the Placement Warrants for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 of $ 1,468,649 and $ 0 , respectively. Refer to Note 13 for discussion of fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities. The following table provides the activity for all warrants for the respective periods. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Remaining ​ Average ​ Aggregate ​ ​ Total Warrants ​ Term ​ Exercise Price ​ Intrinsic Value Outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (as previously reported) 620,055 11.08 ​ $ 14.61 ​ $ 22,127,594 Retroactive application of reverse recapitalization (Note 4) ​ 2,455,415 ​ — ​ ​ ( 13.53 ) ​ ​ — Outstanding as of December 31, 2020, effect of Merger (Note 4) ​ 3,075,470 ​ 4.34 ​ ​ 1.09 ​ ​ 150,955,963 Issued 3,329,812 3.00 ​ 3.19 ​ 111,082,528 Exercised ( 1,496,216 ) ​ ​ ( 3.19 ) ​ ( 49,913,766 ) Outstanding as of March 31, 2021 4,909,066 3.74 ​ $ 1.78 ​ $ 244,574,345 Issued 3,586,250 5.00 ​ 11.50 ​ 45,724,688 Outstanding as of June 30, 2021 8,495,316 4.09 ​ $ 24.78 ​ $ 42,385,824 ​ Assumed Unit Purchase Options Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding options to purchase up to 600,000 Units exercisable at $ 10.00 per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $ 6,000,000 ) commencing on the Effective Time. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one Public Right and one-half of one Public Warrant. Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) 24 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of one share of Common Stock upon exercise of the Units. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from November 20, 2017. The option grants to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years , respectively, from the effective date of the Company's registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Conversion of Rights Prior to the Merger, the Company had outstanding 6,900,000 and 272,500 Public Rights and Placement Rights, respectively. At the Effective Time, each holder of a right received one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock at the Effective Time, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with the Merger, resulting in the issuance of 717,250 shares of Common Stock to holders of such rights. No fractional shares were issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration was required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares at the Effective Time, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the original unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Company's Initial Public Offering. The shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). ​ 11. Stock-Based Compensation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to the Merger, NeuroRx maintained its 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), under which NeuroRx granted incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based awards, or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. The maximum aggregate shares of common stock that was subject to awards and issuable under the 2016 Plan was 3,472,000 . In connection with the Merger, each NeuroRx stock option that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into an option to acquire an adjusted number of shares of Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price per share (the “Substitute Options”), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former option. In connection with the Merger, each option of NeuroRx that was outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) was assumed by BRPA and converted into the Substitute Options, based on the Option Exchange Ratio (of 4.96), and will continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as were applicable to the former option. Each Substitute Option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of NeuroRx common stock underlying such NeuroRx option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and the per share exercise price of such Substitute Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of NeuroRx common stock by the Option Exchange Ratio. As discussed in Note 4, this ratio incorporates the achievement of the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone. The incremental shares above the Exchange Ratio (of 3.16) upon exercise would be held back pending the outcome of the contingencies and only released if such are achieved. The percentage of total shares of Common Stock subject to each Substitute Option that is vested immediately following the Effective Time will equal the percentage of total shares of NeuroRx common stock subject to each NeuroRx option that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash Milestone does not occur prior to December 31, 2022, each Substitute Option will be adjusted such that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each adjusted Substitute Option, the exercise price per share of each adjusted Substitute Option and the aggregate intrinsic value of each 25 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS adjusted Substitute Option will equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Option had the conversion of NeuroRx options into the Substitute Options been applied using the Exchange Ratio as adjusted accordingly to reflect the impact of the respective milestone not being met. If neither the Earnout Shares Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occurs, each Substitute Option will be adjusted based on the Exchange Ratio. As stated in the Merger Agreement, if any Substitute Options are exercised prior to the earlier of (i) the date that both the Earnout Shares Milestone and Earnout Cash Milestone occur and (ii) December 31, 2022, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock will be held back pending the applicable adjustment to such Substitute Options. Following the determination of that adjustment, NRx Pharmaceuticals will retain any shares forfeited by the option holder in connection with the adjustment and return any remaining shares to the option holder. Upon the closing of the Merger, the outstanding and unexercised NeuroRx stock options became options to purchase an aggregate 2,895,423 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an average exercise price of $ 1.50 per share. The Company accounted for the Substitute Options as a modification of the existing options. Incremental compensation costs, measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified options over the fair value of the original options immediately before its terms are modified, is measured based on the fair value of the underlying shares and other pertinent factors at the modification date. The fair value of the original NeuroRx options and Substitute Options was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for each: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Original Options Substitute Options Strike price ​ $ 1.00 -$ 72.30 ​ $ 0.20 -$ 14.58 ​ Volatility rate ​ 80.0 % 80.0 % Risk-free rate ​ 0.07 %- 0.79 % 0.07 %- 0.79 % Expected term ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ 0.18 - 5.99 ​ Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ The Substitute Options contain both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions (i.e., the achievement of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones). The Company determined it was not probable that the Earnout Cash or Earnout Share Milestone would be met on the Effective Date and at June 30, 2021. Accordingly, the Company will only recognize incremental compensation cost related to the portion of the Substitute Options subject to service-based vesting conditions only. The Company will reevaluate the probability of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones being met and recognize any unamortized incremental compensation cost accordingly in the period during which it becomes probable the milestones will be met. For vested Substitute Options, the Company recognized incremental compensation on the modification date totaling $ 1,014,640 , of which $ 993,500 and $ 21,140 was recognized in General and administrative and Research and development, respectively, in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. For unvested Substitute Options, the Company will recognize incremental compensation over the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date, taking into consideration the probability of the achievement of the Earnout Cash and/or Earnout Share Milestones. Incremental compensation costs related to unvested Substitute Options as of the modification date was $ 25,877,473 . 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan At the Effective Time, the Company adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). As of June 30, 2021, 5,373,049 shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan, inclusive of any shares of Common Stock subject to stock options, restricted stock awards or other awards that were assumed in the Merger and terminate as a result of being unexercised or are forfeited or repurchased by the Company, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2021 Plan equal to 5,373,049 shares of Common Stock. As of June 30, 2021, 2,919,493 shares 26 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS have been awarded and 2,453,556 shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, other stock-based award or other cash-based awards to employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. Option Awards The fair value of each employee and non-employee stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company is a public company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected term of the Company’s stock options for employees has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain options granted contain terms that require all unvested options to immediately vest a) upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) by the US Food and Drug Administration for NRX-101, or b) immediately preceding a change in control of the Company, whichever occurs first. The grant date fair value of employee and non-employee stock option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The following assumptions were used during the following periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Exercise price $ 11.69 -$ 23.41 ​ $ 2.22 -$ 3.07 ​ Risk-free rate of interest ​ 0.79 %- 1.24 % 0.79 %- 0.79 % Expected term (years) ​ 5.5 - 6.5 ​ 4.7 - 5.9 ​ Expected stock price volatility ​ 80 % 80 % Dividend yield ​ — ​ — ​ ​ The following table summarizes the Company’s employee and non-employee stock option activity under the Plan for the following periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ average ​ Aggregate ​ ​ Number of ​ average ​ remaining ​ intrinsic ​ shares exercise price term (years) value Outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (as previously reported) 486,755 ​ $ 10.79 8.8 ​ $ 19,571,655 Retroactive application of reverse recapitalization 1,927,548 ​ ( 8.62 ) ​ ​ ​ Outstanding as of December 31, 2020, effect of Merger 2,414,303 ​ $ 2.17 8.2 ​ $ 53,659,966 Options granted 210,800 ​ ​ 11.69 9.8 ​ ​ 3,825,276 Forfeited ( 198,400 ) ​ ​ ( 2.22 ) — ​ ​ ( 6,587,328 ) Outstanding as of March 31, 2021 ​ 2,426,703 ​ $ 14.58 ​ 8.7 ​ $ 30,388,510 Options granted ​ 587,030 ​ ​ 14.94 ​ 9.9 ​ ​ — Forfeited ​ ( 89,280 ) ​ ​ ( 7.86 ) ​ — ​ ​ ( 339,082 ) Exercised ​ ( 4,960 ) ​ ​ ( 3.07 ) ​ — ​ ​ ( 42,385 ) Outstanding as of June 30, 2021 ​ 2,919,493 ​ $ 5.25 ​ 9.0 ​ $ 20,558,299 Options vested and exercisable as of June 30, 2021 ​ 1,095,294 ​ $ 1.50 ​ 6.1 ​ $ 11,106,829 ​ The aggregate intrinsic value in the above table is calculated as the difference between fair value of the Company’s common stock price and the exercise price of the stock options. The weighted average grant date fair value per share for employee stock and non-employee option grants during the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively was $ 14.31 and $ 18.37 . The weighted average grant date fair value per share for employee stock and non-employee option grants during the three months ended and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively was $ 1.25 and 27 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS $ 1.25 . At June 30, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation related to unvested employee and non-employee stock option awards granted, including unrecognized compensation costs related to Substitute Options of $ 25,877,473 , was $ 33,610,165 , of which the Company expects to recognize $ 9,117,887 over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.89 years.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of and during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximated fair value as they are short term in nature. The fair value of warrants issued for settlement and services are estimated based on the Black-Scholes model during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The carrying value of notes payable approximated the estimated fair values due to their recent issuances. Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities and Earnout Cash contingent consideration represent Level 3 measurements. The following table presents information about the Company’s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Description Level June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Warrant liabilities (Note 10) ​ 3 ​ $ 515,025 ​ $ — Earnout Cash liability (Note 4) 3 ​ $ 25,874,896 ​ $ — ​ Warrant liabilities The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value the Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. 28 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The significant unobservable inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liability that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, 2021 At Effective Time Stock price on valuation date ​ $ 11.62 ​ $ 24.25 ​ Exercise price per share ​ $ 11.50 ​ $ 11.50 ​ Expected life ​ 4.90 ​ 5.0 ​ Volatility ​ 35.7 % 39.0 % Risk-free rate ​ 0.9 % 0.8 % Dividend yield ​ — % — % Fair value of warrants ​ $ 3.78 ​ $ 14.56 ​ ​ A reconciliation of warrant liabilities is included below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2020 ​ $ — Additions pursuant to Merger ​ 1,983,674 Gain upon re-measurement ​ ( 1,468,649 ) Balance as of June 30, 2021 ​ $ 515,025 ​ Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. A reconciliation of the Earnout Cash liability is included below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Balance as of December 31, 2020 ​ $ — Additions pursuant to Merger ​ 25,520,195 Loss upon re-measurement ​ 354,701 Balance as of June 30, 2021 ​ $ 25,874,896 ​ Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares has been estimated using the trading price of our Common Stock at the Effective Time ($ 24.25 ), discounted based on the probability of the Earnout Shares Milestone being met as determined at the Effective Time, and thus represents a Level 2 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The contingent Earnout Shares, if achieved, would be issued to legacy NeuroRx shareholders. The Earnout Shares are a fixed number of shares to be issued to such shareholders on a pro rata basis. The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares were recognized as a deemed dividend. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares was $ 253,130,272 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $ 0 ). 13. Income Taxes The Company recorded no provision or benefit for income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021. 29 Table of Contents NRX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For all periods presented, the pretax losses incurred by the Company received no corresponding tax benefit because the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize the value of any resulting deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its position in future periods to determine if it is appropriate to reduce a portion of its valuation allowance in the future. On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the CARES Act to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, and modification to the net interest deduction limitations. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The Company continues to monitor any effects on its financial statements that may result from the CARES Act. Upon consummation of the Merger, a change in control was deemed to have occurred and the Company's net operating loss carrybacks could be subject to limitations. The Company has no open tax audits with any taxing authority as of June 30, 2021. 14. Related Party Transactions The Company licenses patents that are owned by Glytech, LLC, pursuant to a license agreement (the Glytech Agreement). Glytech, LLC is owned by a co-founder and former Director of the Company, and therefore, a related party. The Glytech agreement requires that the Company pay Glytech for ongoing scientific support and also reimburse Glytech for expenses of obtaining and maintaining patents that are licensed to NRx Pharmaceuticals. During the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company paid a co-founder $ 125,000 and $ 0 , respectively, and during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, $ 125,000 and $ 82,569 , respectively, for continuing technology support services and reimbursed expenses. These support services are ongoing. The Fourth Amendment to the Glytech Agreement, effective as of December 31, 2020, includes an equity value-triggered transfer of Excluded Technology from Glytech to NRx Pharmaceuticals. The Excluded Technology is defined in the Glytech Agreement as any technology, and any know-how related thereto, covered in the licensed patents that do not recite either D-cycloserine or lurasidone individually or jointly. This definition would cover pharmaceutical formulations, including some that NRx Pharmaceuticals considers “pipeline” or “future product” opportunities, that contain a combination of pharmaceutical components different from those contained in NRX-100 and NRX-101. The Excluded Technology will transfer to the Company for no additional consideration if the value of NRx Pharmaceuticals equity held by Glytech exceeds $50,000,000 at any time prior to August 6, 2022. After August 6, 2022, the additional IP will transfer to the Company at no cost. The Company believes the criteria have been met pending the registration of Glytech shares. The CEO of the Company is a major shareholder in the Company. Therefore, his services are deemed to be a related party transaction. He serves the company on a full-time basis and has an employment agreement with the Company and received compensation of $ 137,500 and $ 53,125 during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 286,250 and $ 121,875 during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ actual results may differ materially from those discussed below.

All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. Overview On May 24, 2021, Big Rock Partners Acquisition Group (""BRPA""), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) with NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroRx”), and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of BRPA (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 24, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, Merger Sub was merged with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (“Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). On the Closing Date, BRPA changed its name to NRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“NRx Pharmaceuticals"" or the ""Company”). ​ NRx Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Acute Suicidal Behavior/Ideation (ASIB) in Bipolar Disorder and ZYESAMI (aviptadil), an intravenous and inhaled drug to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19. The NRx Pharmaceuticals Antidepressant Regime was developed based upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise contributed by Prof. Daniel Javitt, PhD, MD, related to the role of the brain’s N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in regulating human thought processes in general and in regulating depression and suicidality. The NRx Pharmaceuticals Antidepressant Regime begins with a single dose of ketamine, an FDA approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101. NRX-101 is being developed as a rapid-onset and sustained treatment for acute suicidal crisis associated with bipolar depression. NRX-101 combines DCS, a NMDA receptor modulator, and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NRX-101 has been awarded Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and a Special Protocol Agreement by the FDA. Peer-reviewed and published results from multiple Phase II clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of DCS. Findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and DCS were added to their treatment regimen. Side effects for patients in a P2a combination study of DCS and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania. Breakthrough Therapy designation was awarded based on the STABIL-B study ( www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02974010) that demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of NRX-101 vs. lurasidone (the current standard of care) in maintaining remission from depression and suicidality following a single stabilizing dose of ketamine. In March 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals initiated development of RLF-100 (aviptadil acetate) (now reformulated as ZYESAMI) in partnership with Relief Therapeutics. ZYESAMI is based on 50 years of research, pioneered by Professor Sami Said, on the role of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide in preventing and treating acute lung injury by protecting the Type II cell in the lung. The rights to Dr. Said’s scientific work are licensed by NRx Pharmaceuticals from the Research Foundation of the State University of New York and NRx Pharmaceuticals expects to cross-license such rights to Relief Therapeutics for use outside US, Canada, and Israel. In that partnership and pursuant to the Relief Agreement, Relief has committed to fund all costs of formulations and clinical development of the RLF Product for the treatment of COVID-19. The companies agreed that NRx Pharmaceuticals would lead all development and sales in the United States, Canada, and Israel, with NRx Pharmaceuticals receiving 50% of the profits generated in those territories. Relief is to lead the development and sale of the RLF Product in the rest of the world with NRx Pharmaceuticals receiving 15% of profits in Europe and the United Kingdom, together with 20% of profits in the rest of the world. For the six months ended June 30, 2021. 32 Table of Contents Relief has reimbursed NRx Pharmaceuticals for approximately $10.9 million of expenses, but has declined to pay approximately $6 million in invoiced costs associated with conduct of the RLF Product clinical trial, reformulation, and manufacture of ZYESAMI. Relief has additionally declined to fund the costs of the inhaled trial product. NRx Pharmaceuticals has advised Relief that NRx Pharmaceuticals is funding those costs with other capital. In an open-label, single center trial at Houston Methodist Hospital, ZYESAMI demonstrated a statistically significant 9-fold advantage in probability of survival and recovery from respiratory failure compared to the standard of care among patients with COVID-19 Respiratory Failure. On June 1, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals reported phase IIb/III study results of ZYESAMI in patients with respiratory failure due to critical COVID-19. The study identified a statistically significant increase in the likelihood that patients treated with ZYESAMI would be alive and free of respiratory failure at 60 days, compared to those treated with placebo, and identified a significantly shorter median hospital stay. The clinical study report filed with the FDA further documented statistically significant advantages for ZYESAMI on all major secondary endpoints. On the basis of these results, the Company applied for FDA Emergency Use Authorization on May 31, 2021 and is currently awaiting the FDA’s response to such application. Should Emergency Use Authorization be granted, this would provide the Company with a one-year period during which ZYESAMI could be marketed for the treatment of COVID-19 in the United States in advance of the Company filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA for formal approval of ZYESAMI for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the recently completed clinical trial and the additional clinical trials currently underway, including the NIH ACTIV3b/TESICO trial (NCT 04843761). If authorized for use, ZYESAMI would be the first drug in the United States indicated specifically for COVID-19 patients who are critically ill with respiratory failure. In July 2021, the nation of Georgia issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for intravenous ZYESAMI (aviptadil) for the treatment of critical COVID-19. Pursuant to this EUA, the Company has sent a team of physicians to Georgia to train local doctors about administering ZYESAMI and the effects of the medicine. The supply of intravenous doses by the Company is being discussed with the Georgia Ministry of Health and with the Ministries of Health of surrounding nations. Although the initial focus has been on the use of intravenous ZYESAMI, the Company has received permission from the FDA to test inhaled ZYESAMI in a phase 2/3 clinical trial for patients with early disease. The Company believes that the inhaled drug will be more convenient for patients to self-administer than the intravenous drug, provided patients are still able to inhale normally and do not have inflammatory debris clogging the alveoli. This clinical trial commenced in January 2021 and is expected to conclude by October 2021. In addition, the Company announced in July 2021 that the phase 2/3 trial for the use of inhaled ZYESAMI has been extended to the nation of Georgia. The Company has also commenced work on a third potential drug product by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Israel (MoU) for an exclusive, worldwide license to develop a novel Coronavirus vaccine (BriLife) developed by the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR). The vaccine has demonstrated a statistically-significant increase in COVID-neutralizing antibody (a sign of immunity to SARS-CoV-2) compared to placebo in phase 2a trials conducted in Israel. The vaccine has further shown indications of neutralizing antibody against that Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in early human studies and in preclinical studies. Under the MoU, the Company is initiating a phase 2b/3 dose-confirmatory trial of the vaccine against COVID-19 in the nation of Georgia. The IIBR will provide technical assistance for the clinical trial. The clinical trial in Georgia will take place at the same time as the completion of the second phase of clinical trials in Israel. If the clinical trials are successful, and subject to the negotiation of definitive licensing agreements with the IIBR, the Company would have an exclusive license to commercialize the vaccine in exchange for agreed upon milestone and royalty payments. Since inception, NRx Pharmaceuticals has incurred significant operating losses. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals, net loss was $16,007,973 and $102,287, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, NRx Pharmaceuticals’s net loss was $41,496,847 and $1,487,769, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals had an accumulated deficit of $131,676,567. 33 Table of Contents COVID-19 Outbreak On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 Outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 Outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak continues to evolve as new variants of the virus appear, including the delta variant. As such, NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot estimate the full magnitude, whether positive or negative, that the pandemic will have on NRx Pharmaceuticals’ business. If the COVID-19 Outbreak continues, it may have a material adverse effect on NRx Pharmaceuticals’ financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2020 and beyond. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. Alternatively, the COVID-19 Outbreak could have a material positive effect on market demand for the COVID-19 targeted therapeutics currently under development by NRx Pharmaceuticals. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 Outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, NRx Pharmaceuticals. is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the year ending December 31, 2021 and beyond. Aside from our COVID-19 related trials, as a result of the COVID-19 Outbreak, most of our other trials have been halted.

From the inception of the ZYESAMI drug development program NRx Pharmaceuticals had funded all operating expenses related to the US development of ZYESAMI and the portion of corporate overhead attributable to that program from the Relief Agreement. The proceeds recorded as “Reimbursement of expenses from Relief Therapeutics” amounted to $771,244 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Pursuant to the Relief Agreement, NRx Pharmaceuticals is responsible for not exceeding the Relief Product trial budget of $8.3 million by more than 30% (approximately $10.7 million) for the original sample size of 144 participants (the “ Initial Budget ”). In October 2020, the study’s Data Safety Monitoring Board and statistical consultant advised NRx Pharmaceuticals to increase the size of the study to at least 200 participants, resulting in an additional $4 million in potential study costs. The Relief Agreement states that costs of drug formulation, manufacture, CMC, stability, etc., are not included within the Initial Budget, however, Relief is required to fund the costs of formulation, stability, and manufacturing at MedisourceRx, Bachem, and Nephron Pharmaceuticals. The Relief Agreement states that in the event Relief does not approve additional overages to the Initial Budget, NRx Pharmaceuticals shall be free to bring in other parties in order to complete the aviptadil study. The Relief Agreement further provides for Relief to fund the costs associated with the clinical development of the inhaled Relief Product in the United States in reliance upon NRx Pharmaceuticals' agreement to conduct, manage, supervise and oversee its clinical development. Should Relief not fund the costs associated with the clinical development of the inhaled Relief Product in the United States, then NRx Pharmaceuticals shall have the freedom to bring a replacement investor. Relief has declined to pay approximately $6 million in invoiced costs associated with conduct of the IV trial, reformulation, and manufacture of ZYESAMI incurred subsequent to December 31, 2020. Relief has additionally declined to fund the costs of the inhaled ZYESAMI product. NRx Pharmaceuticals has initiated the inhaled use clinical trial with other capital. Reverse Recapitalization Merger Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRx’s securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the Effective Time will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Common Stock (“Earnout Shares”) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) (the occurrence of the foregoing, the “Earnout Shares Milestone”), and (ii) an aggregate of $100,000,000 in cash (“Earnout Cash”) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (i.e., ZYESAMI TM ) and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen (i.e., NRX-100/101) in the FDA’s “Orange Book,” in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the “Earnout Cash Milestone”). If the Earnout Shares Milestone is achieved, the Earnout Shares will be issued within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Earnout Shares Milestone. If the Earnout Cash Milestone is achieved, the Merger Agreement does not require the Earnout Cash to be delivered to NeuroRx securityholders within any specified period of time, and the board of directors of NRx Pharmaceuticals will use its good faith judgment to determine the date to pay the Earnout Cash. At June 30, 2021, the fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated to be $25,874,896. Upon closing of the Merger, the estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares was $253,130,272 with such amount recognized as a deemed dividend. As the Company is in an accumulated deficit position as of the measurement date, the resulting deemed dividend is recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital with a corresponding offset recorded to additional paid-in capital (i.e., net impact to additional paid-in capital of $0). The benefit of the contingent right to receive Earnout Cash for option and warrant holders occurs through the Option Exchange Ratio and therefore the amount of Earnout Cash for common stockholders is approximately $88,837,121. In connection with the Merger, a number of subscribers (each, a “Subscriber”) purchased from the Company an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “PIPE”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase 38 Table of Contents price of $10,000,000 (the “PIPE Shares”), pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into prior to the Closing Date. The Company received $8,100,000 in net proceeds after transaction costs. NRx Pharmaceuticals expects to continue to incur operating losses and net cash outflows until such time as it generates a level of revenue from sale or licensing of drug products to support its cost structure. There is no assurance that NRx Pharmaceuticals will achieve profitable operations and if achieved, whether it will be sustained on a continued basis. NRx Pharmaceuticals intends to fund ongoing activities by raising additional capital through equity or debt financings. There can be no assurance that NRX will be successful in raising that additional capital or that such capital, if available, will be on terms that are acceptable to NRx Pharmaceuticals. If NRx Pharmaceuticals is unable to raise sufficient additional capital, NRx Pharmaceuticals may be compelled to reduce the scope of its operations and planned capital expenditures. Prior to the Merger, the Company sold 62,366 shares of common stock during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and received gross proceeds of $1,436,274. The Company sold 398,647 shares of common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and received gross proceeds of $8,363,132. In addition, 1,496,216 warrants were exercised generating gross proceeds of $7,500,018. Subsequent to June 30, 2021, NRx Pharmaceuticals received $9,186,316 from the exercise of the GEM Warrant for the purchase of 1,833,596 shares. NRx Pharmaceuticals’ research programs beyond 2021 would require additional funding either from sales of product or from external investment. Until such time as NRx Pharmaceuticals is able to establish a revenue stream from the sale of its therapeutic products, NRx Pharmaceuticals is dependent upon obtaining necessary equity and/or debt financing to continue operations. NRx Pharmaceuticals cannot make any assurances that sales of ZYESAMI will commence in 2021 or that additional financings will be available to it and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact NRx Pharmaceuticals' business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of NRx Pharmaceuticals' operations.

The milestone payments for developmental and commercial milestones range from $100,000 to $750,000. Annual maintenance fees range up to $150,000. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements NRx Pharmaceuticals is not party to any off-balance sheet transactions. NRx Pharmaceuticals has no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates NRx Pharmaceuticals' management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires NRx Pharmaceuticals to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, NRx Pharmaceuticals evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates relate to the valuation of conversion features of convertible notes and common stock, the valuation of stock options and warrants and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses. NRx Pharmaceuticals bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experiences, and various other factors that NRx Pharmaceuticals believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. NRx Pharmaceuticals defines its critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require it to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which NRx Pharmaceuticals applies those principles. While its significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to its financial statements, NRx Pharmaceuticals believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. 40 Table of Contents Fair value of common and preferred stock Prior to the Merger, in order to determine the fair value of shares of its common stock, the Company's board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of its common stock and preferred stock based on arms-length transactions with third party investors. Subsequent to the Merger, the Board determines the fair value of the Common Stock based on the closing market price on the date of grant. Share-based compensation Our stock-based awards are classified as equity (stock options and warrants). We recognize related share-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the awards. We estimate the fair value of all stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model which requires the use of subjective assumptions that could materially impact the estimation of fair value and related compensation expense to be recognized. One of these assumptions include the expected volatility of our stock price. Developing this assumption requires the use of judgment. The Company, both prior to and after the Merger, lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. We also estimate the fair value of our common stock based on third party sales of our common stock Warrant liability We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach. Earnout Cash liability The fair value of the Earnout Cash liability has been estimated using probability-weighted discounted cash flow models (DCFs) with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The DCFs incorporate Level 3 inputs including estimated discount rates that we believe market participants would consider relevant in pricing and the projected timing and amount of cash flows, which are estimated and developed, considering the uncertainties associated with the obligations. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the Company) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or entities (a Business Combination). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company has one subsidiary, Big Rock Merger Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in Delaware on January 22, 2019 (Merger Sub). All activity through March 31, 2021 relates to the Companys formation, its initial public offering (Initial Public Offering), which is described below, identifying a target company for a Business Combination, and activities in connection with the proposed acquisition of NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (NeuroRx) (see Note 8). The registration statement for the Companys Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 20, 2017. On November 22, 2017, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the Units and, with respect to the common stock included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares), generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000, which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one right (Public Right) and one-half of one warrant (Public Warrant). Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 250,000 units (the Private Placement Units) at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement to Big Rock Partners Sponsor, LLC (the Sponsor), generating gross proceeds of $2,500,000, which is described in Note 4. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, $60,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account) which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. On November 29, 2017, in connection with the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option in full, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 900,000 Units, and the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Placement Units at $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $9,225,000. A total of $9,000,000 of the net proceeds were deposited in the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $69,000,000. At the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (EarlyBirdCapital) and its designees 120,000 shares of common stock (the Representative Shares). On November 29, 2017, the Company issued an additional 18,000 Representative Shares for no consideration (see Note 9). Transaction costs amounted to $2,172,419, consisting of $1,725,000 of underwriting fees and $447,419 of Initial Public Offering costs. 5 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) The Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Companys initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the Public Shares) upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account ($10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Companys warrants. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, a stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Companys Sponsor, officers and directors (the Initial Stockholders) have agreed (a) to vote their Founders Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares held by them in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to convert any Founders Shares, Placement Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination or sell any such shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. The Company initially had until November 22, 2018 to complete a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipated that it would not be able to consummate a Business Combination by November 22, 2018, the Company could extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months. Pursuant to the terms of the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on November 20, 2017, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $690,000 ($0.10 per share) for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of $1,380,000, or $0.20 per share, if the Company extends for the full six months, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On November 20, 2018, the period of time for the Company to consummate a Business Combination was extended for an additional three-month period ending on February 22, 2019, and, accordingly, $690,000 was deposited into the Trust Account. On February 21, 2019, the Company further extended the time required to consummate a Business Combination to May 22, 2019 and deposited an additional $690,000 into the Trust Account. The deposits were funded by non-interest bearing unsecured promissory notes from BRAC Lending Group LLC, an affiliate of the underwriter (the BRAC) (see Note 6). The notes are repayable upon the consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 6). 6 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) On May 21, 2019, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company was required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019.

The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through August 22, 2019. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $286,814 into the Trust Account, of which $280,000 was contributed to the Trust Account by a third party and is not required to be repaid by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has recorded this amount as a credit to additional paid in capital in the accompanying statements of stockholders equity. In order to pay for part of the third extension payment, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Second Note) in favor of BRAC, in the original principal amount of $6,814 (see Note 6). On August 21, 2019, the Company stockholders approved an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the Extension) from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Extension was 846,888.

On November 21, 2019, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the Second Extension) from November 22, 2019 to March 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Second Extension was 919,091. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $9,736,077, or approximately $10.59 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Second Extension. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $60,285 into the Trust Account to fund the first thirty-day extension through December 22, 2019, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners and BRAC (see Note 6). In January and February 2020, AZ Property Partners and BRAC loaned the Company an additional aggregate amount of $90,427 each to pay for the extension through March 23, 2020, which was deposited into the Trust Account. On March 23, 2020, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the Third Extension) from March 23, 2020 to July 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Third Extension was 2,433,721. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $25,997,965, or approximately $10.68 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Third Extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Companys common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period was equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeded 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $34,858 into the Trust Account to fund the extension through July 23, 2020, of which $17,429 was loaned to the Company by each of AZ Property Partners and BRAC. 7 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) On July 23, 2020, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the Fourth Extension) from July 23, 2020 to December 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Fourth Extension was 27,786. The Company paid cash in amount of $299,253, or approximately $10.77 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Fourth Extension. In connection with this extension, as of December 31, 2020, the Company deposited an aggregate of $55,274 into the Trust Account to fund the extension through December 23, 2020, which amounts were loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners and BRAC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Companys common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). On December 18, 2020, the Company held a special meeting pursuant to which the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the Fifth Extension) from December 23, 2020 to April 23, 2021 (the Extended Date). In connection with this extension, no stockholders elected to redeem their shares of common stock. On April 21, 2021, the Company held a special meeting pursuant to which the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the Sixth Extension) from April 23, 2021 to May 24, 2021 (the Extended Date). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Fourth Extension was 330. The Company paid cash in amount of $299,253, or approximately $10.77 per share, to redeeming stockholders. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the $10.00 per Unit in the Initial Public Offering. The Initial Stockholders have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to Founder Shares, Placement Shares and any Public Shares they may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination, (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founders Shares and Placement Shares if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination by the Extended Date and (iii) not to propose an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Companys obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, the Initial Stockholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions with respect to any Public Shares acquired if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination or liquidates by Extended Date. 8 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, A/Z Property Partners, has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company. Additionally, the agreement entered into by AZ Property Partners specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that AZ Property Partners will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. NASDAQ Notifications On January 4, 2021, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that the Companys failure to hold an annual stockholder meeting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 by December 31, 2020, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5820, could serve as an additional basis for delisting the Companys securities from Nasdaq. The Company requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the Staffs determination with respect to both notices and the hearing was held on January 14, 2021. The Panels decision is subject to certain conditions, including that the Company will have completed its proposed business combination (the Business Combination) with NeuroRx on or before the Extended Date and that the combined company will have demonstrated compliance with all requirements for initial listing on Nasdaq. While the Company expects to complete the Business Combination by the Extended Date, the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to do so. On January 15, 2021, the Company received notice from the Nasdaq that a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (Panel) had granted the Companys request to continue its listing on Nasdaq through May 24, 2021 (Extended Date). Liquidity As of March 31, 2021, the Company had $232 in its operating bank account, $5,968,035 in cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or convert stock in connection therewith and an adjusted working capital deficit of $643,461, which excludes prepaid income taxes of $59,492, which have been paid from amounts in the Trust Account. As of March 31, 2021, approximately $120,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Companys tax obligations. To date, the Company has withdrawn $716,788 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Companys franchise and income taxes, of which no amounts were withdrawn during the three months ended March 31, 2021. On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with the Sponsor and BRAC, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018 and to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than Business Combination expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed. If a Business Combination is not consummated, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor will be forgiven (see Note 6). In addition, BRAC agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the Business Combination Expenses) and such loans will be added to the Initial Notes (as defined in Note 6). If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination (see Note 6). 9 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Other than as described above, the Companys officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Companys working capital needs. The Company does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating its business. Neither the Sponsor, nor any of the stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties are under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, the Company, except as discussed above. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if the Company can obtain sufficient financing or raise additional capital, it only has until May 24, 2021 (or as may be extended) to consummate a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so prior to May 24, 2021, or as may be extended by shareholder vote. Risks and Uncertainties Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Companys financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys Annual Report as amended on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2020 as filed with the SEC on May 14, 2021, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021 or for any future interim periods. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 10 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Emerging Growth Company The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys consolidated financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Use of Estimates The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from the Companys estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Cash and Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Through March 31, 2021, the Company has withdrawn $716,788 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay its franchise and income taxes, of which no amounts were withdrawn during the three months ended March 31, 2021. 11 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Warrant Liability The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Companys own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Companys control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach (see Note 10). Income Taxes The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 25% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily due to permanent differences. The Company may be subject to potential examination by federal, state and city taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal, state and city tax laws. The Companys management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. Net Income (Loss) Income Per Common Share Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company has not considered the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 3,586,250 shares of common stock, (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement that convert into 717,250 shares of common stock and (3) 600,000 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock and rights that convert into 60,000 shares of common stock in the unit purchase option sold to the underwriter, in the calculation of diluted (loss) income per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive. 12 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), which establishes framework for measuring fair value and clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework. ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price, which is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the Companys principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820 generally requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the entitys own assumptions based on market data and the entitys judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are to be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The valuation hierarchy is composed of three levels. The classification within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels within the valuation hierarchy are described below: Level 1Assets and liabilities with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges. Inputs to the fair value measurement are observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2Inputs to the fair value measurement are determined using prices for recently traded assets and liabilities with similar underlying terms, as well as direct or indirect observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs, such as estimates, assumptions, and valuation techniques when little or no market data exists for the assets or liabilities. The fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature. See Note 10 for additional information on assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 13 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Debt  Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging  Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (ASU 2020-06) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entitys own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2022 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021.The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on the Companys financial statements. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys condensed financial statements. 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 6,900,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option of 900,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one Public Right and one Public Warrant. Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 8). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 9). 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased 250,000 Private Placement Units, at $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,500,000. On November 29, 2017, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which were purchased by the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of common stock (Placement Share), one right (Placement Right) and one-half of one warrant (each, a Placement Warrant), each whole Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50. The proceeds from the Private Placement Units were added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Placement Rights and the Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. In addition, the Private Placement Units and their component securities may not be transferable, assignable or salable until after the consummation of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 14 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Founder Shares In September 2017, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,437,500 shares of common stock to the Sponsor (the Founder Shares) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On November 20, 2017, the Company effectuated a 1.2-for-1 stock dividend of its common stock resulting in an aggregate of 1,725,000 Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 225,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Initial Stockholders would own 20% of the Companys issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (excluding the Private Placement Units and the Representative Shares (as defined in Note 8)). As a result of the underwriters election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, 225,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The Initial Stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founders Shares until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or (ii) with respect to 50% of the Founder Shares, the date on which the closing price of the Companys common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after a Business Combination, or earlier, in each case, if subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction which results in all of the Companys stockholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property. Related Party Loans In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Companys officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, as may be required (Working Capital Loans). Each Working Capital Loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The Working Capital Loans would either be paid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the holders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the Working Capital Loans may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the loans will be forgiven. There were no outstanding Working Capital Loans at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 6. EXTENSION FUNDING AGREEMENT AND PROMISSORY NOTES On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an Extension Funding Agreement with the Sponsor and BRAC. Pursuant to the Extension Funding Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founders Shares to BRAC in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Extension Funding Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and BRAC agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the Extensions). On November 20, 2018 and February 21, 2019, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes (the Initial Notes) in favor of BRAC, in the original principal amount of $690,000 each (or an aggregate of $1,380,000), to provide the Company the funds necessary to obtain an aggregate of six-months of Extensions. Pursuant to the Extension Funding Agreement, BRAC has also agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the Business Combination Expenses) and such loans will be added to the Initial Notes. In connection with the stockholders approval of the extended date of August 22, 2019, the Company issued another unsecured promissory note (the Second Note) in favor of BRAC in order to pay for part of the third extension payment in the original principal amount of $6,814. 15 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) On December 31, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note, as amended (the Third Note and, together with the Initial Notes and the Second Note, the Extension Notes), in favor of BRAC in the aggregate principal amount of $323,075 in order to pay for part of the extension payments. Through March 31, 2021, BRAC loaned the Company an aggregate of $578,281, of which $155,206 was loaned during the three months ended March 31, 2021 for working capital purposes. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Extension Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance under the Extension Notes amounted to an aggregate of $1,965,095 and 1,809,889, respectively. The Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company effective November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Companys shareholders, as described in the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by the Company to the Sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the Cap) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Extension Notes, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. On December 31, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, as amended, in the principal amount of $837,057 to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven, except as set forth above. Through March 31,2021, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an aggregate of $885,604, of which $23,456 was loaned during the three months ended March 31, 2021 to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance under promissory note with AZ Property Partners amounted to $885,604 and $862,148, respectively. 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Forgiveness of Debt During the three months ended March 31, 2020, one of the Companys service providers forgave certain amounts due to them in connection with previously provided services. As a result, the Company recorded a forgiveness of debt in the amount of $352,071. 16 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Registration Rights Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November 20, 2017, the holders of the Companys common stock prior to the Initial Public Offering (the Founder Shares), Private Placement Units (and their underlying securities), the shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital at the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the Representative Shares) and any Units that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans (and their underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founders Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Placement Units or Units issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company (in each case, including the underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders will have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital and its designees may participate in a piggy-back registration during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Business Combination Marketing Agreement The Company has engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist the Company in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. Merger Agreement On December 13, 2020, the Company, NeuroRx and Merger Sub, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into NeuroRx, with NeuroRx surviving the merger (Merger). As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (Transactions), NeuroRx will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with the stockholders of NeuroRx becoming stockholders of the Company. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to the stockholders of NeuroRx at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time) will equal 50,000,000 shares (Closing Consideration) of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (Company Common Stock), plus the additional contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash (each as defined below). At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of NeuroRx common stock (including shares of NeuroRx common stock resulting from the conversion of NeuroRx preferred stock immediately prior to the Effective Time) will be converted into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the Closing Consideration and the contingent right to receive a pro rata portion of the Earnout Shares and Earnout Cash. Each option and warrant of NeuroRx that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by the Company and will represent the right to acquire an adjusted number of shares of the Company Common Stock at an adjusted exercise price, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. 17 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) As part of the aggregate consideration payable to NeuroRxs securityholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeuroRxs securityholders (including option holders and warrant holders) who own NeuroRx securities immediately prior to the closing of the Transactions will have the contingent right to receive their pro rata portion of (i) an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of the Company Common Stock (Earnout Shares) if, prior to December 31, 2022, the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug receives emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and NeuroRx submits and the FDA files for review a new drug application for the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug (the occurrence of the foregoing, the Earnout Shares Milestone), and (ii) an aggregate of $100,000,000 in cash (Earnout Cash) upon the earlier to occur of (x) FDA approval of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug and the listing of the NeuroRx COVID-19 Drug in the FDAs Orange Book and (y) FDA approval of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen and the listing of the NeuroRx Antidepressant Drug Regimen in the FDAs Orange Book, in each case prior to December 31, 2022 (the occurrence of either of clauses (x) or (y), the Earnout Cash Milestone). On March 19, 2021, the Company entered into a second amendment (Amendment) to the Merger Agreement with NeuroRx and Merger Sub. The Amendment extends the outside date by which the parties must consummate the Merger from April 23, 2021 to May 24, 2021. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties thereto and the closing is subject to certain conditions as further described in the Merger Agreement. Subscription Agreement On March 12, 2021, the Company entered into subscription agreements (Subscription Agreements) with certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors (collectively, the PIPE Investors), pursuant to which the Company will, substantially concurrently with, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Merger, issue an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of the Company Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, to the PIPE Investors at a price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $10,000,000 (the PIPE). The closing of the PIPE is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger, (ii) the accuracy of all representations and warranties of the Company and the PIPE Investors in the Subscription Agreements, and the performance of all covenants of the Company and the PIPE Investors under the Subscription Agreements, (iii) the shares of the Company Common Stock shall have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to official notice of issuance, and (iv) the Merger Agreement shall not have been terminated or rescinded, and no amendment, waiver or modification shall have occurred thereunder that would materially adversely affect the economic benefits that the PIPE Investor would reasonably expect to receive under the Subscription Agreement without having received the PIPE Investors prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Legal Proceedings In connection with the proposed Merger with NeuroRx, a purported stockholder of the Company has filed a lawsuit and other purported stockholders have threatened to file lawsuits alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of the disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company intends to defend the matters vigorously. These matters are in the early stages and the Company is currently unable to reasonably determine the outcome or estimate any potential losses, and, as such, has not recorded a loss contingency. 8. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Preferred Stock  The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Companys Board of Directors. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. Common Stock  The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. Holders of the Companys common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were 2,688,242 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 18 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Rights  Each holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive 1/10 share underlying each right (without paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Companys assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, holders of the rights might not receive the shares of common stock underlying the rights. Representative Shares At the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued EarlyBirdCapital and its designees 120,000 Representative Shares. On November 29, 2017, the Company issued an additional 18,000 Representative Shares for no consideration. The Company accounted for the Representative Shares as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders equity. The Company determined the fair value of Representative Shares to be $1,380,000 based upon the offering price of the Units of $10.00 per Unit. The underwriter has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the underwriter and its designees have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. Unit Purchase Option On November 22, 2017, the Company sold to EarlyBirdCapital, for $100, an option to purchase up to 600,000 Units exercisable at $10.00 per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $6,000,000) commencing on the later of November 20, 2018 or the consummation of a Business Combination. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holders option, and expires five years from November 20, 2017. The Units issuable upon exercise of this option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of $100 cash payment, as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders equity. The Company estimated the fair value of this unit purchase option to be $2,042,889 (or $3.40 per Unit) using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the unit purchase option granted to the underwriters was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 35%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 2.05% and (3) expected life of five years. The option and such units purchased pursuant to the option, as well as the common stock underlying such units, the rights included in such units, the common stock that is issuable for the rights included in such units, the warrants included in such units, and the shares underlying such warrants, have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of FINRAs NASDAQ Conduct Rules. Additionally, the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year period (including the foregoing 180-day period) following the date of Initial Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the Initial Public Offering and their bona fide officers or partners. The option grants to holders demand and piggy back rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. 19 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) The Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Companys recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. 9. WARRANT LIABIILITY Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of a Business Combination and November 22, 2018; provided in that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective 90 days following the consummation of Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: in whole and not in part; at a price of $0.01 per warrant; at any time during the exercise period; upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption; and if, and only if, the last sale price of the Companys common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Companys assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. 20 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2021 (Unaudited) 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The following table presents information about the Companys assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: Description Assets: Marketable securities held in Trust Account Liabilities: Warrant liability Placement Warrants The Company utilizes a Black-Scholes model approach to value the Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the Statements of Operations. The estimated fair value of the warrant liability is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero. The significant unobservable inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to measure the warrant liabilities that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Stock price Strike price Term (in years) Volatility Risk-free rate Dividend yield Fair value of private warrants The following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value of the Companys Level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Fair value as of January 1, 2021 Change in valuation inputs or other assumptions Fair value as of March 31, 2021 There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy. 21 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses or entities (a Business Combination). Our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial Business Combination are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt. Recent Developments Extensions to Complete Business Combination On April 21, 2021, our stockholders approved an amendment to the charter to extend the date by which we must complete a business combination from April 23, 2021 to May 24, 2021 (the Seventh Extension). Stockholders holding an aggregate of 330 public shares exercised their right to convert such shares of the Companys common stock into cash in connection with the Seventh Extension. 23 Nasdaq Compliance On January 4, 2021, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that the Companys failure to hold an annual stockholder meeting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 by December 31, 2020, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5820, could serve as an additional basis for delisting the Companys securities from Nasdaq. The Company requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the Staffs determination with respect to both notices and the hearing was held on January 14, 2021. The Panels decision is subject to certain conditions, including that the Company will have completed its proposed business combination (the Business Combination) with NeuroRx on or before the Extended Date and that the combined company will have demonstrated compliance with all requirements for initial listing on Nasdaq. While the Company expects to complete the Business Combination by the Extended Date, the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to do so. On January 14, 2021, the Company attended a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel with respect to the November 23, 2020 and January 2, 2021 delisting notices. During the hearing, the Company requested an extension through May 24, 2021 to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. On January 15, 2021, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that Nasdaq had granted the Companys request to continue its listing on Nasdaq through May 24, 2021. Nasdaqs decision is subject to certain conditions, including that the Company will have completed the Merger with NeuroRx on or before the Extended Date and that NRX Pharmaceuticals will have demonstrated compliance with all requirements for initial listing on Nasdaq. On January 15, 2021, the Company received notice from the Nasdaq that a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (Panel) had granted the Companys request to continue its listing on Nasdaq through May 24, 2021 (Extended Date). Subscription Agreement On March 12, 2021, the Company entered into subscription agreements (Subscription Agreements) with certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors (collectively, the PIPE Investors), pursuant to which the Company will, substantially concurrently with, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Merger, issue an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of the Company Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, to the PIPE Investors at a price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $10,000,000 (the PIPE). The closing of the PIPE is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger, (ii) the accuracy of all representations and warranties of the Company and the PIPE Investors in the Subscription Agreements, and the performance of all covenants of the Company and the PIPE Investors under the Subscription Agreements, (iii) the shares of the Company Common Stock shall have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to official notice of issuance, and (iv) the Merger Agreement shall not have been terminated or rescinded, and no amendment, waiver or modification shall have occurred thereunder that would materially adversely affect the economic benefits that the PIPE Investor would reasonably expect to receive under the Subscription Agreement without having received the PIPE Investors prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Amendment to the Merger Agreement On March 19, 2021, the Company entered into a second amendment (Amendment) to the Merger Agreement with NeuroRx and Merger Sub. The Amendment extends the outside date by which the parties must consummate the Merger from April 23, 2021 to May 24, 2021. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Since our Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 24 For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $893,718, which consists of operating expenses of $235,580 and a change in fair value of warrant liability of $658,226, offset by interest income on securities held in the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the Trust Account) of $88. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we had net income of $273,220, which consists of forgiveness of debt of $352,071, interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $113,077 offset by operating expenses of $119,300 and a provision for income taxes of $72,628. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $5,968,035 (including approximately $120,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. To date, we have withdrawn $716,788 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay our income and franchise taxes, of which no amounts were withdrawn during the three months ended March 31, 2021. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities amounted to $178,896 which included a net loss of $893,718, a non-cash charge derived from the change in fair value of warrant liability of $658,226, interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $88 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $56,684 of cash for operating activities. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities amounted to $76,434 which included net income of $273,220 interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $113,007, the forgiveness of debt of $352,071 and changes in operating assets and liabilities. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to effect our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, continuing or expanding the target business operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any expenses or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of March 31, 2021, A/Z Property has loaned us an aggregate of $885,604 in order to pay our Non-Business Combination Related Expenses and extension payments. Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses may be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the Cap) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Notes, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. As of March 31, 2021, BRAC has loaned us an aggregate of $1,965,095 in order to fund a portion of the extension payments and for working capital purposes. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor, officers and directors or their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, except as described above, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. 25 Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2021. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. We have engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist us in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist us in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. We will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Warrant Liability We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Companys own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Companys control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black Scholes valuation approach. 26 Net Loss Per Common Share We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net loss per common share, basic and diluted for common shares subject to possible redemption is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account, net of applicable taxes, if any, by the weighted average number of shares of common subject to possible redemption outstanding for the period. Net loss per common share, basic and diluted for and non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing net loss less income attributable to common shares subject to possible redemption, by the weighted average number of shares of non-redeemable shares common stock outstanding for the period presented. Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Debt  Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging  Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (ASU 2020-06) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entitys own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2022 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK This item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers), carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2021. In light of the restatement of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 to reclassify our Private Warrants as derivative liabilities, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2021. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, as the circumstances that led to the restatement of our year-end financial statements on May 4, 2021 had not yet been identified. Due solely to the events that led to our restatement of our financial statements, management has identified a material weakness in internal controls related to the accounting for our Private Warrants. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to enhance our system of evaluating and implementing the accounting standards that apply to our financial statements, including through enhanced analyses by our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 27 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. All activity through September 30, 2020 relates to the Company’s formation, its initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and the search for a target business with which to complete a Business Combination. The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 20, 2017. On November 22, 2017, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000, which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one right (“Public Right”) and one-half of one warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 250,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement to Big Rock Partners Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $2,500,000, which is described in Note 4. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, $60,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. On November 29, 2017, in connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 900,000 Units, and the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Placement Units at $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $9,225,000. A total of $9,000,000 of the net proceeds were deposited in the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $69,000,000. At the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (""EarlyBirdCapital"") and its designees 120,000 shares of common stock (the “Representative Shares”). On November 29, 2017, the Company issued an additional 18,000 Representative Shares for no consideration (see Note 8). Transaction costs amounted to $2,172,419, consisting of $1,725,000 of underwriting fees and $447,419 of Initial Public Offering costs. The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company’s initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Shares”) upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account ($10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. 5 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, a stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, officers and directors (the “Initial Stockholders”) have agreed (a) to vote their Founder’s Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares held by them in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to convert any Founder’s Shares, Placement Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination or sell any such shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. The Company initially had until November 22, 2018 to complete a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipated that it would not be able to consummate a Business Combination by November 22, 2018, the Company could extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on November 20, 2017, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $690,000 ($0.10 per share) for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of $1,380,000, or $0.20 per share, if the Company extends for the full six months, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On November 20, 2018, the period of time for the Company to consummate a Business Combination was extended for an additional three-month period ending on February 22, 2019, and, accordingly, $690,000 was deposited into the Trust Account. On February 21, 2019, the Company further extended the time required to consummate a Business Combination to May 22, 2019 and deposited an additional $690,000 into the Trust Account. The deposits were funded by non-interest bearing unsecured promissory notes from BRAC Lending Group LLC, an affiliate of the underwriter (the “Investor”) (see Note 6). The notes are repayable upon the consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 6). On May 21, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company was required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,119,772. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through August 22, 2019. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $286,814 into the Trust Account, of which $280,000 was contributed to the Trust Account by a third party and is not required to be repaid by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has recorded this amount as a credit to additional paid in capital in the accompanying statements of stockholders’ equity. In order to pay for part of the third extension payment, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $6,814 (see Note 6). On August 21, 2019, the Company stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Extension”) from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Extension was 846,888. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $8,891,378, or approximately $10.50 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extension. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $236,000 into the Trust Account to fund this extension payment, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners, LLC (“AZ Property Partners”), an entity majority owned and controlled by Richard Ackerman, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Investor (see Note 6). On November 21, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Second Extension”) from November 22, 2019 to March 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Second Extension was 919,091. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $9,736,077, or approximately $10.59 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Second Extension. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $60,285 into the Trust Account to fund the first thirty-day extension through December 22, 2019, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners and Investor (see Note 6). In January and February 2020, AZ Property Partners and Investor loaned the Company an additional aggregate amount of $90,427 each to pay for the extension through March 23, 2020, which was deposited into the Trust Account. On March 23, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Third Extension”) from March 23, 2020 to July 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Third Extension was 2,433,721. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $25,997,965, or approximately $10.68 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Third Extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period was equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeded 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $34,858 into the Trust Account to fund the extension through July 23, 2020, of which $17,429 was loaned to the Company by each of AZ Property Partners and the Investor. 6 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) On July 23, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Fourth Extension”) from July 23, 2020 to December 23, 2020 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Fourth Extension was 27,786. The Company paid cash in amount of $299,253, or approximately $10.77 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Fourth Extension. In connection with this extension, as of November 13, 2020, the Company deposited an aggregate of $44,219 into the Trust Account, of which $22,110 was deposited as of September 30, 2020, to fund the extension through November 23, 2020, which amounts were loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners and the Investor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the $10.00 per Unit in the Initial Public Offering. The Initial Stockholders have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to Founder Shares, Placement Shares and any Public Shares they may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination, (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder’s Shares and Placement Shares if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination by the Extended Date and (iii) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, the Initial Stockholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions with respect to any Public Shares acquired if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination or liquidates by Extended Date. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, A/Z Property Partners, has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company. Additionally, the agreement entered into by AZ Property Partners specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that AZ Property Partners will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. NASDAQ Notifications On January 7, 2019, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the “Staff”) stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company submitted a plan of compliance with Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted the Company an extension until May 22, 2019 to regain compliance with the rule by holding an annual meeting of stockholders. The Company held its annual meeting of stockholders on May 21, 2019 and, accordingly, the Staff determined that the Company was in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing and the matter was closed. On August 9, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders (the “Rule”). The Company had until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and had no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company's securities on Nasdaq. On September 23, 2019 and October 28, 2019, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq and requested an extension through February 5, 2020. On October 28, 2019, Nasdaq requested additional information regarding the Company's compliance plan, to which the Company responded on November 8, 2019. On February 11, 2020, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that, based upon the Company’s non-compliance with the Rule, the Staff had determined to delist the Company’s common stock from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel“). The Company was also notified that as a result of Nasdaq’s determination to delist the Company’s common stock, the Company’s warrants and rights no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5560(a), which requires the underlying securities of such exercisable securities to remain listed on Nasdaq, and the Company’s Units no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(b)(1)(A), which requires all component parts of units to meet the requirements for initial and continued listing, and the Company’s units, warrants and rights are now subject to delisting. The Company requested a hearing, which request automatically stayed any further action by the Staff pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. 7 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) On March 25, 2020, the Company received formal notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Staff had granted the Company’s request for continued listing on Nasdaq. The decision follows the Company’s hearing before the Panel, which took place on March 19, 2020. The Company’s continued listing is subject to the Company’s satisfaction of a number of conditions, including, ultimately, completion of a Business Combination with an operating company by no later than August 10, 2020, and the combined entity’s compliance with all applicable criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq at the time of the merger. The Company failed to meet certain of the conditions contained in the extension grant and has submitted a modified extension request to the Staff. On August 10, 2020, the Company submitted a letter to Nasdaq indicating that it was in compliance with the Rule as of July 31, 2020 and, as a result, satisfies the minimum 300 public holder requirement and all other applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. Accordingly, the Company requested that the Staff render a formal determination to continue the listing of the Company’s securities. On August 11, 2020, the Company received a formal notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it regained compliance with the minimum 300 public holder requirement under Nasdaq rules and that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company's securities on Nasdaq and close the matter. Liquidity As of September 30, 2020, the Company had $40,018 in its operating bank account, $5,934,671 in cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or convert stock in connection therewith and an adjusted working capital deficit of $328,380, which excludes prepaid income taxes of $46,286, which have been paid from amounts in the Trust Account. As of September 30, 2020, approximately $120,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company’s tax obligations. To date, the Company has withdrawn $716,788 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes, of which $161,430 was withdrawn during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and the Investor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018 and to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than Business Combination expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed. If a Business Combination is not consummated, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor will be forgiven (see Note 6). In addition, the Investor agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Initial Notes (as defined in Note 6). If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination (see Note 6). The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Other than as described above, the Company’s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. The Company does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating its business. Neither the Sponsor, nor any of the stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties are under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, the Company, except as discussed above. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if the Company can obtain sufficient financing or raise additional capital, it only has until November 23, 2020 to consummate a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so prior to November 23, 2020. Risks and Uncertainties Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company's financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 8 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP.

Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2020, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020 or for any future interim periods. Emerging Growth Company The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Use of Estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 9 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Cash and Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Through September 30, 2020, the Company has withdrawn $716,788 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay its franchise and income taxes, of which $161,430 was withdrawn during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption The Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets. At September 30, 2020, there are no shares of common stock subject to possible redemption. Income Taxes The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The effective tax rate of 25% and 110% differs from the statutory tax rate of 25% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, primarily due to true-up adjustments from the prior year tax returns. The Company may be subject to potential examination by federal, state and city taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal, state and city tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ""CARES"" Act into law. The CARES Act includes several significant business tax provisions that, among other things, would eliminate the taxable income limit for certain net operating losses (""NOL) and allow businesses to carry back NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the five prior years, suspend the excess business loss rules, accelerate refunds of previously generated corporate alternative minimum tax credits, generally loosen the business interest limitation under IRC section 163(j) from 30 percent to 50 percent among other technical corrections included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax provisions. The Company does not believe that the CARES Act will have a significant impact on Company's financial position or statement of operations. Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share Net (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at September 30, 2020 and 2019, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net (loss) income per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 3,586,250 shares of common stock, (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement that convert into 717,250 shares of common stock and (3) 600,000 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock and rights that convert into 60,000 shares of common stock in the unit purchase option sold to the underwriter, in the calculation of diluted (loss) income per share, since the exercise of the warrants, the conversion of the rights into shares of common stock and the exercise of the unit purchase option are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted (loss) income per common share is the same as basic (loss) income per common share for the periods presented. 10 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share The Company’s net (loss) income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not the income or losses of the Company. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share is calculated as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net (loss) income $ (125,779 ) $ 59,195 $ (2,060 ) $ 423,181 Less: Income attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption — (159,486 ) — (658,996 ) Adjusted net (loss) income $ (125,779 ) $ (100,291 ) $ (2,060 ) $ (235,815 ) Weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 2,697,303 2,801,350 2,752,380 2,773,842 Basic and diluted net (loss) income per common share $ (0.05 ) $ (0.04 ) $ (0.00 ) $ (0.09 ) Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed financial statements. 11 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 6,900,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option of 900,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one Public Right and one Public Warrant. Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 8). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 8). 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased 250,000 Private Placement Units, at $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,500,000. On November 29, 2017, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which were purchased by the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Placement Share”), one right (“Placement Right”) and one-half of one warrant (each, a “Placement Warrant”), each whole Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50. The proceeds from the Private Placement Units were added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Placement Rights and the Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. In addition, the Private Placement Units and their component securities may not be transferable, assignable or salable until after the consummation of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Founder Shares In September 2017, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,437,500 shares of common stock to the Sponsor (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On November 20, 2017, the Company effectuated a 1.2-for-1 stock dividend of its common stock resulting in an aggregate of 1,725,000 Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 225,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Initial Stockholders would own 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming the Initial Stockholders did not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering and excluding the Private Placement Units and the Representative Shares (as defined in Note 8)). As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, 225,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The Initial Stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder’s Shares until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or (ii) with respect to 50% of the Founder Shares, the date on which the closing price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after a Business Combination, or earlier, in each case, if subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property. Related Party Loans In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Each Working Capital Loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The Working Capital Loans would either be paid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the Working Capital Loans may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the loans will be forgiven. There were no outstanding Working Capital Loans at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 12 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) 6. INVESTOR AGREEMENT AND PROMISSORY NOTES On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement with the Sponsor and the Investor. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founders Shares to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the “Extensions”). On November 20, 2018 and February 21, 2019, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes (the “Initial Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000 each (or an aggregate of $1,380,000), to provide the Company the funds necessary to obtain an aggregate of six-months of Extensions. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Initial Notes. In connection with the stockholders’ approval of the extended date of August 22, 2019, the Company issued another unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note”) in favor of the Investor in order to pay for part of the third extension payment in the original principal amount of $6,814. On December 31, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note, as amended on March 31, 2020, June 30,2020 and September 30, 2020, (the “Third Note” and, together with the Initial Notes and the Second Note, the “Extension Notes”) in favor of the Investor in the aggregate principal amount of $317,547 in order to pay for part of the extension payments. Through September 30, 2020, the Investor loaned the Company an aggregate of $306,492, of which $124,717 was loaned during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to pay for part of the extension payments through September 23, 2020 and $32,967 was loaned during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to pay for extension related costs. In October 2020, the Investor loaned the Company an additional $11,055 to pay for part of the extension through November 23, 2020. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Extension Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination. As of September 30, 2020, the outstanding balance under the Extension Notes amounted to an aggregate of $1,693,306. The Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company effective November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Company’s shareholders, as described in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by the Company to the Sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Extension Notes, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. On December 31, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, as amended on March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, in the principal amount of $837,057 to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses incurred through September 30, 2020 and expenses incurred thereafter. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven, except as set forth above. Through September 30, 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an aggregate of $758,060, of which $124,717 was loaned during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to pay for part of the extension payments through September 23, 2020 and $217,202 was loaned during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. In October 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an additional $11,055 to pay for part of the extension through November 23, 2020 and an additional $67,942 to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. As of September 30, 2020, the outstanding balance under promissory note with AZ Property Partners amounted to $758,060. 13 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Forgiveness of Debt During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, one of the Company’s service providers forgave certain amounts due to them in connection with previously provided services. As a result, the Company recorded a forgiveness of debt in the amount of $352,071. Registration Rights Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November 20, 2017, the holders of the Company’s common stock prior to the Initial Public Offering (the “Founder Shares”), Private Placement Units (and their underlying securities), the shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital at the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Representative Shares”) and any Units that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans (and their underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder’s Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Placement Units or Units issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company (in each case, including the underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital and its designees may participate in a “piggy-back” registration during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Business Combination Marketing Agreement The Company has engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist the Company in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. 8. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. Common Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were 2,688,242 and 2,844,414 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively (excluding -0- and 2,305,335 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption, respectively). 14 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Rights — Each holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive 1/10 share underlying each right (without paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, holders of the rights might not receive the shares of common stock underlying the rights. Warrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of a Business Combination and November 22, 2018; provided in that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective 90 days following the consummation of Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: ● in whole and not in part; ● at a price of $0.01 per warrant; ● at any time during the exercise period; ● upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption; and ● if, and only if, the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. ● If, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. 15 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 (Unaudited) If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. Representative Shares At the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued EarlyBirdCapital and its designees 120,000 Representative Shares. On November 29, 2017, the Company issued an additional 18,000 Representative Shares for no consideration. The Company accounted for the Representative Shares as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The Company determined the fair value of Representative Shares to be $1,380,000 based upon the offering price of the Units of $10.00 per Unit. The underwriter has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the underwriter and its designees have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. Unit Purchase Option On November 22, 2017, the Company sold to EarlyBirdCapital, for $100, an option to purchase up to 600,000 Units exercisable at $10.00 per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $6,000,000) commencing on the later of November 20, 2018 or the consummation of a Business Combination. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from November 20, 2017. The Units issuable upon exercise of this option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of $100 cash payment, as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The Company estimated the fair value of this unit purchase option to be $2,042,889 (or $3.40 per Unit) using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the unit purchase option granted to the underwriters was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 35%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 2.05% and (3) expected life of five years. The option and such units purchased pursuant to the option, as well as the common stock underlying such units, the rights included in such units, the common stock that is issuable for the rights included in such units, the warrants included in such units, and the shares underlying such warrants, have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of FINRA’s NASDAQ Conduct Rules. Additionally, the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year period (including the foregoing 180-day period) following the date of Initial Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the Initial Public Offering and their bona fide officers or partners. The option grants to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on the Company's assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 16 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP.

Such forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect management’s current beliefs, based on information currently available. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements, including the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our search for a business combination and our ability to complete a business combination. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2020, except as described in our Quarterly Report of Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 filed with teh SEC on August 14, 2020. The Company’s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial Business Combination are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt. Recent Developments Extensions to Complete Business Combination On July 23, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which we are required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Fourth Extension”) from July 23, 2020 to December 23, 2020 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Fourth Extension was 27,786. We paid cash in amount of approximately $299,000, or approximately $10.77 per share, to redeeming stockholders. We agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Fourth Extension. As of November 13, 2020, in connection with this extension, we deposited an aggregate of $44,219 into the Trust Account to fund the extension through November 23, 2020. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). 18 Results of Operations Our entire activity since September 18, 2017 (inception) up to November 20, 2017 was in preparation for our Initial Public Offering. Since our Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, we had a net loss of $125,779, which consists of operating expenses of $169,028, offset by interest income on securities held in the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”) of $559 and an income tax benefit of $42,690. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we had net loss of $2,060, which consists of operating expenses of $469,587 and a provision for income taxes of $23,197, offset by the forgiveness of previously recorded professional fees of $352,071 and interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $138,653. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we had a net income of $59,195, which consists of interest income on securities held in the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”) of $258,236, offset by operating costs of $183,305 and provision for income taxes of $15,736. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we had a net income of $423,181, which consists of interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $1,033,537, offset by operating costs of $522,228 and provision for income taxes of $88,128. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2020, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $5,934,671 (including approximately $120,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. To date, we have withdrawn $716,788 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay our income and franchise taxes, of which $161,430 was withdrawn during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, cash used in operating activities amounted to $371,559. Net loss of $2,060 was the result of the forgiveness of previously recorded professional fees in the amount of $352,071 and interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $138,653 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $121,225 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, cash used in operating activities amounted to $530,657. Net income of $423,181 was the result of interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $1,033,537, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $79,699 of cash for operating activities. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to effect our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of September 30, 2020, A/Z Property has loaned us an aggregate of $758,060 in order to pay our Non-Business Combination Related Expenses and extension payments. Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses may be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Notes, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. As of September 30, 2020, the Investor has loaned us an aggregate of $1,693,306 in order to fund a portion of the extension payments. 19 We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor, officers and directors or their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, except as described above, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2020. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. We have engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist us in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist us in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. We will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our condensed balance sheets. At September 30, 2020 there are no shares of common stock subject to possible redemption. 20 Net Loss Per Common Share We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Common stock subject to possible redemption which is not currently redeemable and is not redeemable at fair value, has been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per common share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not our income or losses. Recent Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK This item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2020. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2020. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 21 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2020. As of the date of this Report, other than as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report filed with the SEC. The securities in which we invest the funds held in the Trust Account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share. The proceeds held in the Trust Account are invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our public stockholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the Trust Account, plus any interest income not released to us, net of taxes payable. Negative interest rates could impact the per-share redemption amount that may be received by public stockholders. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS On July 23, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved to amend its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination to December 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 27,786. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of approximately $299,000, or approximately $10.77 per share, to redeeming stockholders. For additional information, see Note 1 to the condensed financial statements. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. All activity through June 30, 2020 relates to the Company’s formation, its initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and the search for a target business with which to complete a Business Combination. The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 20, 2017. On November 22, 2017, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000, which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one right (“Public Right”) and one-half of one warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 250,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement to Big Rock Partners Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $2,500,000, which is described in Note 4. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, $60,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. On November 29, 2017, in connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 900,000 Units, and the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Placement Units at $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $9,225,000. A total of $9,000,000 of the net proceeds were deposited in the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $69,000,000. At the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (""EarlyBirdCapital"") and its designees 120,000 shares of common stock (the “Representative Shares”). On November 29, 2017, the Company issued an additional 18,000 Representative Shares for no consideration (see Note 8). Transaction costs amounted to $2,172,419, consisting of $1,725,000 of underwriting fees and $447,419 of Initial Public Offering costs. The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company’s initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Shares”) upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account ($10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. 5 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, a stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, officers and directors (the “Initial Stockholders”) have agreed (a) to vote their Founder’s Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares held by them in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to convert any Founder’s Shares, Placement Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination or sell any such shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. The Company initially had until November 22, 2018 to complete a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipated that it could not be able to consummate a Business Combination by November 22, 2018, the Company could extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on November 20, 2017, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $690,000 ($0.10 per share) for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of $1,380,000, or $0.20 per share, if the Company extends for the full six months, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On November 20, 2018, the period of time for the Company to consummate a Business Combination was extended for an additional three-month period ending on February 22, 2019, and, accordingly, $690,000 was deposited into the Trust Account. On February 21, 2019, the Company further extended the time required to consummate a Business Combination to May 22, 2019 and deposited an additional $690,000 into the Trust Account. The deposits were funded by non-interest bearing unsecured promissory notes from BRAC Lending Group LLC, an affiliate of the underwriter (the “Investor”) (see Note 6). The notes are repayable upon the consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 6). On May 21, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company was required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,119,772. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through August 22, 2019. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $286,814 into the Trust Account, of which $280,000 was contributed to the Trust Account by a third party and is not required to be repaid by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has recorded this amount as a credit to additional paid in capital in the accompanying statements of stockholders’ equity. In order to pay for part of the third extension payment, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $6,814 (see Note 6). On August 21, 2019, the Company stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Extension”) from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Extension was 846,888. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $8,891,378, or approximately $10.50 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extension. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $236,000 into the Trust Account to fund this extension payment, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners, LLC (“AZ Property Partners”), an entity majority owned and controlled by Richard Ackerman, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Investor (see Note 6). On November 21, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Second Extension”) from November 22, 2019 to March 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Second Extension was 919,091. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $9,736,077, or approximately $10.59 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Second Extension. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $60,285 into the Trust Account to fund the first thirty-day extension through December 22, 2019, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners and Investor (see Note 6). In January and February 2020, AZ Property Partners and Investor loaned the Company an additional aggregate amount of $90,427 each to pay for the extension through March 23, 2020, which was deposited into the Trust Account. On March 23, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Third Extension”) from March 23, 2020 to July 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Third Extension was 2,433,721. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $25,997,965, or approximately $10.68 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Third Extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3 rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $34,858 into the Trust Account to fund the extension through July 23, 2020, of which $17,429 was loaned to the Company by each of AZ Property Partners and Investor. 6 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) On July 23, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Fourth Extension”) from July 23, 2020 to December 23, 2020 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Fourth Extension was 27,786. The Company paid cash in amount of approximately $299,253, or approximately $10.77 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Fourth Extension. In connection with this extension, as of July 31, 2020, the Company deposited an aggregate of $11,055 into the Trust Account to fund the first thirty-day extension through August 23, 2020, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners and Investor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the $10.00 per Unit in the Initial Public Offering. The Initial Stockholders have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to Founder Shares, Placement Shares and any Public Shares they may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination, (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder’s Shares and Placement Shares if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination by the Extended Date and (iii) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, the Initial Stockholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions with respect to any Public Shares acquired if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination or liquidates by Extended Date. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, A/Z Property Partners, has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company. Additionally, the agreement entered into by AZ Property Partners specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that AZ Property Partners will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. NASDAQ Notifications On January 7, 2019, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the “Staff”) stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company submitted a plan of compliance with Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted the Company an extension until May 22, 2019 to regain compliance with the rule by holding an annual meeting of stockholders. The Company held its annual meeting of stockholders on May 21, 2019 and, accordingly, the Staff determined that the Company was in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing and the matter was closed. On August 9, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders (the “Rule”). The Company had until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and had no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company's securities on Nasdaq. On September 23, 2019 and October 28, 2019, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq and requested an extension through February 5, 2020. On October 28, 2019, Nasdaq requested additional information regarding the Company's compliance plan, to which the Company responded on November 8, 2019. On February 11, 2020, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that, based upon the Company’s non-compliance with the Rule, the Staff had determined to delist the Company’s common stock from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel“). The Company was also notified that as a result of Nasdaq’s determination to delist the Company’s common stock, the Company’s warrants and rights no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5560(a), which requires the underlying securities of such exercisable securities to remain listed on Nasdaq, and the Company’s Units no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(b)(1)(A), which requires all component parts of units to meet the requirements for initial and continued listing, and the Company’s units, warrants and rights are now subject to delisting. The Company requested a hearing, which request automatically stayed any further action by the Staff pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. On March 25, 2020, the Company received formal notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Staff had granted the Company’s request for continued listing on Nasdaq. The decision follows the Company’s hearing before the Panel, which took place on March 19, 2020. The Company’s continued listing is subject to the Company’s satisfaction of a number of conditions, including, ultimately, completion of a Business Combination with an operating company by no later than August 10, 2020, and the combined entity’s compliance with all applicable criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq at the time of the merger. The Company failed to meet certain of the conditions contained in the extension grant and has submitted a modified extension request to the Staff. 7 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) On August 10, 2020, the Company submitted a letter to Nasdaq indicating that it was in compliance with the Rule as of July 31, 2020 and, as a result, satisfies the minimum 300 public holder requirement and all other applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. Accordingly, the Company requested that the Staff render a formal determination to continue the listing of the Company’s securities. On August 11, 2020, the Company received a formal notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it regained compliance with the minimum 300 public holder requirement under Nasdaq rules and that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company's securities on Nasdaq and close the matter. Liquidity As of June 30, 2020, the Company had $7 in its operating bank account, $6,240,245 in cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or convert stock in connection therewith and a working capital deficit of $264,031, which excludes prepaid income taxes of $3,596, which have been paid from amounts in the Trust Account. As of June 30, 2020, approximately $168,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company’s tax obligations. To date, the Company has withdrawn approximately $676,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes, of which approximately $121,000 was withdrawn during the six months ended June 30, 2020. On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and the Investor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018 and to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than Business Combination expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed. If a Business Combination is not consummated, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor will be forgiven (see Note 6). In addition, the Investor agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes (as defined in Note 6). If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination (see Note 6). The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Other than as described above, the Company’s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. The Company does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating its business. Neither the Sponsor, nor any of the stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties are under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, the Company, except as discussed above. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if the Company can obtain sufficient financing or raise additional capital, it only has until August 23, 2020 to consummate a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so prior to August 23, 2020. Risks and Uncertainties Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company's financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2020, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The interim results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020 or for any future interim periods. 8 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Emerging Growth Company The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Use of Estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Cash and Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Through June 30, 2020, the Company has withdrawn $676,188 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes, of which $120,830 was withdrawn during the six months ended June 30, 2020. Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption The Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets. At June 30, 2020, there are no shares of common stock subject to possible redemption. 9 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Income Taxes The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The effective tax rate of 4% and 35% differs from the statutory tax rate of 25% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to true-up adjustments from the prior year tax returns. The Company may be subject to potential examination by federal, state and city taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal, state and city tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ""CARES"" Act into law. The CARES Act includes several significant business tax provisions that, among other things, would eliminate the taxable income limit for certain net operating losses (""NOL) and allow businesses to carry back NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the five prior years, suspend the excess business loss rules, accelerate refunds of previously generated corporate alternative minimum tax credits, generally loosen the business interest limitation under IRC section 163(j) from 30 percent to 50 percent among other technical corrections included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax provisions. The Company does not believe that the CARES Act will have a significant impact on Company's financial position or statement of operations. Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share Net (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at June 30, 2020 and 2019, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net (loss) income per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 3,586,250 shares of common stock, (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement that convert into 717,250 shares of common stock and (3) 600,000 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock and rights that convert into 60,000 shares of common stock in the unit purchase option sold to the underwriter, in the calculation of diluted (loss) income per share, since the exercise of the warrants, the conversion of the rights into shares of common stock and the exercise of the unit purchase option are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted (loss) income per common share is the same as basic (loss) income per common share for the periods presented. 10 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share The Company’s net (loss) income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not the income or losses of the Company. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share is calculated as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net (loss) income $ (149,501 ) $ 176,021 $ 123,719 $ 363,986 Less: Income attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption — (259,727 ) — (518,924 ) Adjusted net (loss) income $ (149,501 ) $ (83,706 ) $ 123,719 $ (154,938 ) Weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 2,716,028 2,794,297 2,780,221 2,759,859 Basic and diluted net (loss) income per common share $ (0.06 ) $ (0.03 ) $ 0.04 $ (0.06 ) Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed financial statements. 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 6,900,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option of 900,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one Public Right and one Public Warrant. Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 8). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 8). 11 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased 250,000 Private Placement Units, at $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,500,000. On November 29, 2017, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which were purchased by the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Placement Share”), one right (“Placement Right”) and one-half of one warrant (each, a “Placement Warrant”), each whole Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50. The proceeds from the Private Placement Units were added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Placement Rights and the Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. In addition, the Private Placement Units and their component securities may not be transferable, assignable or salable until after the consummation of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Founder Shares In September 2017, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,437,500 shares of common stock to the Sponsor (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On November 20, 2017, the Company effectuated a 1.2-for-1 stock dividend of its common stock resulting in an aggregate of 1,725,000 Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 225,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Initial Stockholders would own 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming the Initial Stockholders did not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering and excluding the Private Placement Units and the Representative Shares (as defined in Note 8)). As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, 225,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The Initial Stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder’s Shares until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or (ii) with respect to 50% of the Founder Shares, the date on which the closing price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after a Business Combination, or earlier, in each case, if subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property. Related Party Loans In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Each Working Capital Loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The Working Capital Loans would either be paid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the Working Capital Loans may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the loans will be forgiven. There were no outstanding Working Capital Loans at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 12 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) 6. INVESTOR AGREEMENT AND PROMISSORY NOTES On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement with the Sponsor and the Investor. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founders Shares to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the “Extensions”). On November 20, 2018 and February 21, 2019, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes (the “Initial Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000 each (or an aggregate of $1,380,000), to provide the Company the funds necessary to obtain an aggregate of six-month Extensions. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. In connection with the stockholders’ approval of the extended date of August 22, 2019, the Company issued another unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note”) in favor of the Investor in order to pay for part of the third extension payment in the original principal amount of $6,814. On December 31, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note, as amended on March 31, 2020, (the “Third Note” and, together with the Initial Notes and the Second Note, the “Extension Notes”) in favor of the Investor in the aggregate principal amount of $269,667 in order to pay for part of the extension payments. Through December 31, 2019, the Investor loaned the Company an aggregate amount of $118,667 under the Third Note to pay for part of the extension payment in connection with the Extension to November 22, 2019. In November 2019, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the extended date of March 23, 2020, the Investor loaned the Company an additional $30,142 under the Third Note to pay for part of the extension through December 22, 2019.

In March, April and June 2020, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the extended date of July 23, 2020, the Investor loaned the Company, under the Third Note, an aggregate amount of $17,429 to pay for part of the extension through June 23, 2020. In July 2020, the Investor loaned the Company an additional $5,805 to pay for part of the extension through July 23, 2020. In April 2020, under the Third Note, the Investor loaned the Company an aggregate amount of $24,612 for working capital purposes. In July 2020, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the Extended Date of December 23, 2020, the Investor loaned the Company, under the Third Note, an additional $5,527 to pay for part of the extension through August 23, 2020. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Extension Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination. As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding balance under the Extension Notes amounted to an aggregate of $1,668,091. The Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company effective November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Company’s shareholders, as described in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by the Company to the Sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Extension Notes, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. On December 31, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, as amended on March 31, 2020 and on June 30, 2020, in the original principal amount of $685,476 to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. Of the amount loaned to the Company, $117,334 was used in order to pay for part of the extension payments in connection with the Extension to November 22, 2019. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven, except as set forth above. In November 2019, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the extended date of March 23, 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an additional $30,143 to pay for part of the extension through December 2019. In January and February 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an aggregate additional amount of $90,427 to pay for part of the extension through March 23, 2020. 13 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP.

In July 2020, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the Extended Date of December 23, 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an additional $5,527 to pay for part of the extension through August 23, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding balance under promissory note with AZ Partners amounted to $685,476. 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Forgiveness of Debt During the six months ended June 30, 2020, one of the Company’s service providers forgave certain amounts due to them in connection with previously provided services. As a result, the Company recorded a forgiveness of debt in the amount of $352,071. Registration Rights Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November 20, 2017, the holders of the Company’s common stock prior to the Initial Public Offering (the “Founder Shares”), Private Placement Units (and their underlying securities), the shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital at the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Representative Shares”) and any Units that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans (and their underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder’s Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Placement Units or Units issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company (in each case, including the underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital and its designees may participate in a “piggy-back” registration during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Business Combination Marketing Agreement The Company has engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist the Company in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. 14 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) 8. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. Common Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were 2,716,028 and 2,844,414 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively (excluding -0- and 2,305,335 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption, respectively). Rights — Each holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive 1/10 share underlying each right (without paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, holders of the rights might not receive the shares of common stock underlying the rights. Warrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of a Business Combination and November 22, 2018; provided in that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective 90 days following the consummation of Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: ● in whole and not in part; ● at a price of $0.01 per warrant; ● at any time during the exercise period; ● upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption; and ● if, and only if, the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. ● If, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. 15 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2020 (Unaudited) If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. Representative Shares At the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued EarlyBirdCapital and its designees 120,000 Representative Shares. On November 29, 2017, the Company issued an additional 18,000 Representative Shares for no consideration. The Company accounted for the Representative Shares as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The Company determined the fair value of Representative Shares to be $1,380,000 based upon the offering price of the Units of $10.00 per Unit. The underwriter has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the underwriter and its designees have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. Unit Purchase Option On November 22, 2017, the Company sold to EarlyBirdCapital, for $100, an option to purchase up to 600,000 Units exercisable at $10.00 per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $6,000,000) commencing on the later of November 20, 2018 or the consummation of a Business Combination. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from November 20, 2017. The Units issuable upon exercise of this option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of $100 cash payment, as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The Company estimated the fair value of this unit purchase option to be $2,042,889 (or $3.40 per Unit) using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the unit purchase option granted to the underwriters was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 35%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 2.05% and (3) expected life of five years. The option and such units purchased pursuant to the option, as well as the common stock underlying such units, the rights included in such units, the common stock that is issuable for the rights included in such units, the warrants included in such units, and the shares underlying such warrants, have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of FINRA’s NASDAQ Conduct Rules. Additionally, the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year period (including the foregoing 180-day period) following the date of Initial Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the Initial Public Offering and their bona fide officers or partners. The option grants to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 16 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the condensed financial statements were issued. Other than as described in the notes to these financial statements, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed financial statements. 17 ITEM 2.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial Business Combination are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt. Recent Developments Extensions to Complete Business Combination On March 23, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which we are required to consummate a Business Combination from March 23, 2020 to July 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with this extension was 2,433,721. We paid cash in the aggregate amount of $25,997,965, or approximately $10.68 per share, to the redeeming stockholders. We agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on our behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through July 23, 2020. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). In connection with this extension, through June 30, 2020, we deposited an aggregate of $34,858 into the Trust Account to fund the extension through June 23, 2020, which amounts were loaned to us by A/Z Property and Investor. In July 2020, AZ Property Partners and Investors loaned the Company an additional $11,610 to pay for the extension through July 23, 2020. On July 23, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which we are required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Fourth Extension”) from July 23, 2020 to December 23, 2020 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Fourth Extension was 27,786. We paid cash in amount of approximately $299,000, or approximately $10.77 per share, to redeeming stockholders. We agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Fourth Extension. In July 2020, in connection with this extension, we deposited an aggregate of $11,054 into the Trust Account to fund the first thirty-day extension through August 23, 2020. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). Nasdaq On August 9, 2019, we received a notice from the Staff stating that we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders (the “Rule”). We had until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the listing or trading of our securities on Nasdaq. On September 23, 2019 and October 28, 2019, we submitted a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq and requested an extension through February 5, 2020. On October 28, 2019, Nasdaq requested additional information regarding our compliance plan, to which we responded on November 8, 2019. On February 11, 2020, we received a notice from the Staff stating that, based upon our non-compliance with the Rule, the Staff had determined to delist our common stock from Nasdaq unless we timely request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel“). We were also notified that as a result of Nasdaq’s determination to delist our common stock, our warrants and rights no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5560(a), which requires the underlying securities of such exercisable securities to remain listed on Nasdaq, and our Units no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(b)(1)(A), which requires all component parts of units to meet the requirements for initial and continued listing, and our units, warrants and rights are now subject to delisting. We requested a hearing, which request automatically stayed any further action by the Staff pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. 18 On March 25, 2020, we received formal notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Panel the Staff had granted our request for continued listing on Nasdaq. The decision follows our hearing before the Panel, which took place on March 19, 2020. Our continued listing is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including, ultimately, completion of a business combination with an operating company by no later than August 10, 2020, and the combined entity’s compliance with all applicable criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq at the time of the merger. We failed to meet certain of the conditions contained in the extension grant and have submitted a modified extension request to the Staff. On August 10, 2020, we submitted a letter to Nasdaq indicating that we were in compliance with the Rule as of July 31, 2020 and, as a result, satisfied the minimum 300 public holder requirement and all other applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. Accordingly, we requested that the Staff render a formal determination to continue the listing of our securities. On August 11, 2020, the Company received a formal notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it regained compliance with the minimum 300 public holder requirement under Nasdaq rules and that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company's securities on Nasdaq and close the matter. Results of Operations Our entire activity since September 18, 2017 (inception) up to November 20, 2017 was in preparation for our Initial Public Offering. Since our Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended June 30, 2020, we had a net loss of $149,501, which consists of operating expenses of $181,259, offset by interest income on securities held in the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”) of $25,017 and an income tax benefit of $6,741. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, we had net income of $123,719, which consists of the forgiveness of previously recorded professional fees of $352,071 and interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $138,094, offset by operating expenses of $300,559 and a provision for income taxes of $65,887. For the three months ended June 30, 2019, we had a net income of $176,021, which consists of interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $392,439, offset by operating expenses of $175,742 and provision for income taxes of $40,676. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, we had a net income of $363,986, which consists of interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $775,301, offset by operating expenses of $338,923 and provision for income taxes of $72,392. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2020, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $6,240,245 (including approximately $168,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. To date, we have withdrawn approximately $676,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay our income and franchise taxes, of which approximately $121,000 was withdrawn during the six months ended June 30, 2020. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, cash used in operating activities amounted to $306,891. Net income of $123,719 was the result of the forgiveness of previously recorded professional fees in the amount of $352,071 and interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $138,094 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $59,555 of cash for operating activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, cash used in operating activities amounted to $478,343. Net income of $363,986 was the result of interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $775,301, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $67,028 of cash for operating activities. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to effect our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of June 30, 2020, A/Z Property has loaned us an aggregate of $685,476 in order to pay our Non-Business Combination Related Expenses and extension payments. Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses may repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Notes, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. 19 As of June 30, 2020, the Investor has loaned us an aggregate of $1,668,091 in order to fund a portion of the extension payments. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor, officers and directors or their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, except as described above, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2020. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. We have engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist us in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist us in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. We will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our condensed balance sheets. At June 30, 2020 there are no shares of common stock subject to possible redemption. Net Loss Per Common Share We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Common stock subject to possible redemption which is not currently redeemable and is not redeemable at fair value, has been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per common share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not our income or losses. 20 Recent Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK This item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2020. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of June 30, 2020. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 21 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2020. As of the date of this Report, other than as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report filed with the SEC. The securities in which we invest the funds held in the Trust Account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share. The proceeds held in the Trust Account are invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our public stockholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the Trust Account, plus any interest income not released to us, net of taxes payable. Negative interest rates could impact the per-share redemption amount that may be received by public stockholders. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS On July 23, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved to amend its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination to December 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 27,786. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of approximately $299,000, or approximately $10.77 per share, to redeeming stockholders. For additional information, see Note 1 to the condensed financial statements. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. All activity through March 31, 2020 relates to the Company’s formation, its initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and the search for a target business with which to complete a Business Combination. The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 20, 2017. On November 22, 2017, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000, which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one right (“Public Right”) and one-half of one warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 250,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement to Big Rock Partners Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $2,500,000, which is described in Note 4. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, $60,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. On November 29, 2017, in connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 900,000 Units, and the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Placement Units at $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $9,225,000. A total of $9,000,000 of the net proceeds were deposited in the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $69,000,000. At the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (""EarlyBirdCapital"") and its designees 120,000 shares of common stock (the “Representative Shares”). On November 29, 2017, the Company issued an additional 18,000 Representative Shares for no consideration (see Note 8). Transaction costs amounted to $2,172,419, consisting of $1,725,000 of underwriting fees and $447,419 of Initial Public Offering costs. The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company’s initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Shares”) upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account ($10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, a stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, officers and directors (the “Initial Stockholders”) have agreed (a) to vote their Founder’s Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares held by them in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to convert any Founder’s Shares, Placement Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination or sell any such shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 5 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) The Company initially had until November 22, 2018 to complete a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipated that it could not be able to consummate a Business Combination by November 22, 2018, the Company could extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on November 20, 2017, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $690,000 ($0.10 per share) for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of $1,380,000, or $0.20 per share, if the Company extends for the full six months, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On November 20, 2018, the period of time for the Company to consummate a Business Combination was extended for an additional three-month period ending on February 22, 2019, and, accordingly, $690,000 was deposited into the Trust Account. On February 21, 2019, the Company further extended the time required to consummate a Business Combination to May 22, 2019 and deposited an additional $690,000 into the Trust Account. The deposits were funded by non-interest bearing unsecured promissory notes from BRAC Lending Group LLC, an affiliate of the underwriter (the “Investor”) (see Note 6). The notes are repayable upon the consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 6). On May 21, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company was required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,119,772. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through August 22, 2019. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $286,814 into the Trust Account, of which $280,000 was contributed to the Trust Account by a third party and is not required to be repaid by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has recorded this amount as a credit to additional paid in capital in the accompanying statements of stockholders’ equity. In order to pay for part of the third extension payment, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $6,814 (see Note 6). On August 21, 2019, the Company stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Extension”) from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Extension was 846,888. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $8,891,378, or approximately $10.50 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extension. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $236,000 into the Trust Account to fund this extension payment, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners, LLC (“AZ Property Partners”), an entity majority owned and controlled by Richard Ackerman, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Investor (see Note 6). On November 21, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Second Extension”) from November 22, 2019 to March 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Second Extension was 919,091. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $9,736,077, or approximately $10.59 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Second Extension. In connection with this extension, the Company deposited an aggregate of $60,285 into the Trust Account to fund the first thirty-day extension through December 22, 2019, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners and Investor (see Note 6). In January and February 2020, AZ Property Partners and Investor loaned the Company an additional aggregate amount of $90,427 each to pay for the extension through March 23, 2020, which was deposited into the Trust Account. On March 23, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Third Extension”) from March 23, 2020 to July 23, 2020 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the Third Extension was 2,433,721. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $25,997,965, or approximately $10.68 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Third Extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3 rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). In connection with this extension, as of March 31, 2020, the Company deposited an aggregate of $11,637 into the Trust Account to fund the first thirty-day extension through April 23, 2020, which amount was loaned to the Company by AZ Property Partners and Investor. In April 2020, the AZ Property Partners and Investor loaned the Company an additional aggregate amount of $5,805 each to pay for the extension through May 23, 2020, which was deposited into the Trust Account. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the $10.00 per Unit in the Initial Public Offering. 6 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) The Initial Stockholders have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to Founder Shares, Placement Shares and any Public Shares they may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination, (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder’s Shares and Placement Shares if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination by the Extended Date and (iii) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, the Initial Stockholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions with respect to any Public Shares acquired if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination or liquidates by Extended Date. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, A/Z Property Partners, has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company. Additionally, the agreement entered into by AZ Property Partners specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that AZ Property Partners will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. NASDAQ Notifications On January 7, 2019, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the “Staff”) stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company submitted a plan of compliance with Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted the Company an extension until May 22, 2019 to regain compliance with the rule by holding an annual meeting of stockholders. The Company held its annual meeting of stockholders on May 21, 2019 and, accordingly, the Staff determined that the Company is currently in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing and the matter was closed. On August 9, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders (the “Rule”). The Company had until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and had no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company's securities on Nasdaq. On September 23, 2019 and October 28, 2019, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq and requested an extension through February 5, 2020. On October 28, 2019, Nasdaq requested additional information regarding the Company's compliance plan, to which the Company responded on November 8, 2019. On February 11, 2020, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that, based upon the Company’s non-compliance with the Rule, the Staff had determined to delist the Company’s common stock from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel“). The Company was also notified that as a result of Nasdaq’s determination to delist the Company’s common stock, the Company’s warrants and rights no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5560(a), which requires the underlying securities of such exercisable securities to remain listed on Nasdaq, and the Company’s Units no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(b)(1)(A), which requires all component parts of units to meet the requirements for initial and continued listing, and the Company’s units, warrants and rights are now subject to delisting. The Company requested a hearing, which request automatically stayed any further action by the Staff pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. On March 25, 2020, the Company received formal notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Staff had granted the Company’s request for continued listing on Nasdaq. The decision follows the Company’s hearing before the Panel, which took place on March 19, 2020. The Company’s continued listing is subject to the Company’s satisfaction of a number of conditions, including, ultimately, completion of a Business Combination with an operating company by no later than August 10, 2020, and the combined entity’s compliance with all applicable criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq at the time of the merger. The Company failed to meet certain of the conditions contained in the extension grant and has submitted a modified extension request to the Staff. The Company has not received a response from the Staff as of yet and cannot give assurance that it will not be delisted prior to August 10, 2020. Liquidity As of March 31, 2020, the Company had $80,774 in its operating bank account, $6,192,007 in cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or convert stock in connection therewith and a working capital deficit of $209,062, which excludes franchise and income taxes payable of 26,545, of which such amounts will be paid from interest earned on the Trust Account and prepaid income taxes, which have been paid from amounts in the Trust Account. As of March 31, 2020, approximately $143,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company’s tax obligations. To date, the Company has withdrawn approximately $676,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes, of which approximately $121,000 was withdrawn during the three months ended March 31, 2020. 7 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and the Investor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018 and to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than Business Combination expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed. If a Business Combination is not consummated, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor will be forgiven (see Note 6). In addition, the Investor agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes (as defined in Note 6). If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination (see Note 6). The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Other than as described above, the Company’s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. The Company does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating its business. Neither the Sponsor, nor any of the stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties are under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, the Company, except as discussed above. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if the Company can obtain sufficient financing or raise additional capital, it only has until July 23, 2020 to consummate a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so prior to July 23, 2020. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2020, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020 or for any future interim periods. Emerging growth company The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 8 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Use of estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Through March 31, 2020, the Company has withdrawn $676,188 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes, of which $120,830 was withdrawn during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Common stock subject to possible redemption The Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets. Income taxes The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019, there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The effective tax rate of 14% differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to the non-deductibility of transactional expenses incurred in connection with the search for potential targets for a Business Combination. The Company may be subject to potential examination by federal, state and city taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal, state and city tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ""CARES"" Act into law. The CARES Act includes several significant business tax provisions that, among other things, would eliminate the taxable income limit for certain net operating losses (""NOL) and allow businesses to carry back NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the five prior years, suspend the excess business loss rules, accelerate refunds of previously generated corporate alternative minimum tax credits, generally loosen the business interest limitation under IRC section 163(j) from 30 percent to 50 percent among other technical corrections included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax provisions. The Company does not believe that the CARES Act will have a significant impact on Company's financial position or statement of operations. 9 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Net loss per common share Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at March 31, 2020 and 2019, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 3,586,250 shares of common stock, (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement that convert into 717,250 shares of common stock and (3) 600,000 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock and rights that convert into 60,000 shares of common stock in the unit purchase option sold to the underwriter, in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants, the conversion of the rights into shares of common stock and the exercise of the unit purchase option are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic income per common share for the periods presented. Reconciliation of net loss per common share The Company’s net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not the income or losses of the Company. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share is calculated as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Net income $ 273,220 $ 187,965 Less: Income attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption — (272,387 ) Adjusted net income (loss) $ 273,220 $ (84,422 ) Weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 2,844,414 2,725,039 Basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share $ 0.10 $ (0.03 ) Concentration of credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature. Recently issued accounting standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed financial statements. 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 6,900,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option of 900,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, one Public Right and one Public Warrant. Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 8). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 8). 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased 250,000 Private Placement Units, at $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,500,000. On November 29, 2017, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 22,500 Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which were purchased by the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Placement Share”), one right (“Placement Right”) and one-half of one warrant (each, a “Placement Warrant”), each whole Placement Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50. The proceeds from the Private Placement Units were added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Placement Rights and the Placement Warrants will expire worthless. 10 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) The Private Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except that the Placement Warrants (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, so long as they are held by the initial purchaser or any of its permitted transferees. In addition, the Private Placement Units and their component securities may not be transferable, assignable or salable until after the consummation of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. If the Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Founder Shares In September 2017, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,437,500 shares of common stock to the Sponsor (the “Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On November 20, 2017, the Company effectuated a 1.2-for-1 stock dividend of its common stock resulting in an aggregate of 1,725,000 Founder Shares outstanding. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 225,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Initial Stockholders would own 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering (assuming the Initial Stockholders did not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering and excluding the Private Placement Units and the Representative Shares (as defined in Note 8)). As a result of the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, 225,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The Initial Stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder’s Shares until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or (ii) with respect to 50% of the Founder Shares, the date on which the closing price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after a Business Combination, or earlier, in each case, if subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property. Related Party Loans In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). Each Working Capital Loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The Working Capital Loans would either be paid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the Working Capital Loans may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the loans will be forgiven. There were no outstanding Working Capital Loans at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 6. INVESTOR AGREEMENT AND PROMISSORY NOTES On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement with the Sponsor and the Investor. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founders Shares to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the “Extensions”). On November 20, 2018 and February 21, 2019, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes (the “Initial Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000 each (or an aggregate of $1,380,000), to provide the Company the funds necessary to obtain an aggregate of six-month Extensions. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. In connection with the stockholders’ approval of the extended date of August 22, 2019, the Company issued another unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note”) in favor of the Investor in order to pay for part of the third extension payment in the original principal amount of $6,814. On December 31, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note, as amended on March 31, 2020, (the “Third Note” and, together with the Initial Notes and the Second Note, the “Extension Notes”) in favor of the Investor in the aggregate principal amount of $269,667 in order to pay for part of the extension payments. Through December 31, 2019, the Investor loaned the Company an aggregate amount of $118,667 under the Third Note to pay for part of the extension payment in connection with the Extension to November 22, 2019. In November 2019, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the extended date of March 23, 2020, the Investor loaned the Company an additional $30,142 under the Third Note to pay for part of the extension through December 22, 2019. In January and February 2020, the Investor loaned the Company an additional $90,427 under the Third Note to pay for part of the extension through March 23, 2020. 11 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) In March 2020, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the Extended Date of July 23, 2020, the Investor loaned the Company an additional $5,819 under the Third Note to pay for part of the extension through April 23, 2020. In April 2020, the Investor loaned the Company an additional $5,805 to pay for part of the extension through May 23, 2020. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Extension Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination. As of March 31, 2020, the outstanding balance under the Extension Notes amounted to an aggregate of $1,631,869. The Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company effective November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Company’s shareholders, as described in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by the Company to the Sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Extension Notes, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. On December 31, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor, as amended on March 31, 2020, in the original principal amount of $579,676 to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. Of the amount loaned to the Company, $117,334 was used in order to pay for part of the extension payments in connection with the Extension to November 22, 2019. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven, except as set forth above. In November 2019, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the extended date of March 23, 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an additional $30,143 to pay for part of the extension through December 2019. In January and February 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an aggregate additional amount of $90,427 to pay for part of the extension through March 23, 2020. In March 2020, in connection with the stockholders’ approval of the Extended Date of July 23, 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an additional $5,818 to pay for part of the extension through April 23, 2020. In April 2020, AZ Property Partners loaned the Company an additional $5,805 to pay for part of the extension through May 23, 2020. Through March 31, 2020, AZ Partners loaned the Company an aggregate amount of $305,065, of which $36,400 was loaned during the three months ended March 31, 2020, to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. As of March 31, 2020, the outstanding balance under promissory note with AZ Partners amounted to $548,787. 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Forgiveness of Debt During the three months ended March 31, 2020, one of the Company’s service providers forgave certain amounts due to them in connection with previously provided services. As a result, the Company recorded a forgiveness of debt in the amount of $352,071. Registration Rights Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November 20, 2017, the holders of the Company’s common stock prior to the Initial Public Offering (the “Founder Shares”), Private Placement Units (and their underlying securities), the shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital at the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Representative Shares”) and any Units that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans (and their underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder’s Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Placement Units or Units issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company (in each case, including the underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital and its designees may participate in a “piggy-back” registration during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 12 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Business Combination Marketing Agreement The Company has engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist the Company in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. 8. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. Common Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were 2,716,028 and 2,844,414 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively (excluding -0- and 2,305,335 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption, respectively). Rights — Each holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive 1/10 share underlying each right (without paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, holders of the rights might not receive the shares of common stock underlying the rights. Warrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of a Business Combination and November 22, 2018; provided in that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective 90 days following the consummation of Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: ● in whole and not in part; ● at a price of $0.01 per warrant; ● at any time during the exercise period; ● upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption; and ● if, and only if, the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. ● If, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants. 13 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2020 (Unaudited) If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. Representative Shares At the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company issued EarlyBirdCapital and its designees 120,000 Representative Shares. On November 29, 2017, the Company issued an additional 18,000 Representative Shares for no consideration. The Company accounted for the Representative Shares as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The Company determined the fair value of Representative Shares to be $1,380,000 based upon the offering price of the Units of $10.00 per Unit. The underwriter has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the underwriter and its designees have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. Unit Purchase Option On November 22, 2017, the Company sold to EarlyBirdCapital, for $100, an option to purchase up to 600,000 Units exercisable at $10.00 per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $6,000,000) commencing on the later of November 20, 2018 or the consummation of a Business Combination. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires five years from November 20, 2017. The Units issuable upon exercise of this option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of $100 cash payment, as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The Company estimated the fair value of this unit purchase option to be $2,042,889 (or $3.40 per Unit) using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the unit purchase option granted to the underwriters was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 35%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 2.05% and (3) expected life of five years. The option and such units purchased pursuant to the option, as well as the common stock underlying such units, the rights included in such units, the common stock that is issuable for the rights included in such units, the warrants included in such units, and the shares underlying such warrants, have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of FINRA’s NASDAQ Conduct Rules. Additionally, the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year period (including the foregoing 180-day period) following the date of Initial Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the Initial Public Offering and their bona fide officers or partners. The option grants to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The following table presents information about the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: 14 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the condensed financial statements were issued. Other than as described in the notes to these financial statements, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed financial statements. 15 I TEM 2.

Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial Business Combination are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt. Recent Developments On March 23, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which we are required to consummate a Business Combination from March 23, 2020 to July 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with this extension was 2,433,721. We paid cash in the aggregate amount of $25,997,965, or approximately $10.68 per share, to the redeeming stockholders. We agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on our behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through July 23, 2020. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the volume weighted average price of the Company's common stock during the 10-day trading period ending on the 3 rd day prior to the end of any applicable monthly period is equal to or greater than $11.00 and the trading volume during the 10-day trading period exceeds 100,000 shares, the obligation to make any particular deposit would terminate with respect to the immediately following monthly period (but not with respect to any other future monthly period). In connection with this extension, we deposited an aggregate of $11,637 into the Trust Account to fund the first thirty-day extension through April 23, 2020, which amounts were loaned to us by A/Z Property and Investor. In April 2020, AZ Property Partners and Investors loaned the Company an additional $11,610 to pay for part of the extension through May 23, 2020. On August 9, 2019, we received a notice from the Staff stating that we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders (the “Rule”). We had until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the listing or trading of our securities on Nasdaq. On September 23, 2019 and October 28, 2019, we submitted a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq and requested an extension through February 5, 2020. On October 28, 2019, Nasdaq requested additional information regarding our compliance plan, to which we responded on November 8, 2019. On February 11, 2020, we received a notice from the Staff stating that, based upon our non-compliance with the Rule, the Staff had determined to delist our common stock from Nasdaq unless we timely request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel“). We were also notified that as a result of Nasdaq’s determination to delist our common stock, our warrants and rights no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5560(a), which requires the underlying securities of such exercisable securities to remain listed on Nasdaq, and our Units no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5225(b)(1)(A), which requires all component parts of units to meet the requirements for initial and continued listing, and our units, warrants and rights are now subject to delisting. We requested a hearing, which request automatically stayed any further action by the Staff pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. On March 25, 2020, we received formal notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Panel the Staff had granted our request for continued listing on Nasdaq. The decision follows our hearing before the Panel, which took place on March 19, 2020. Our continued listing is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including, ultimately, completion of a business combination with an operating company by no later than August 10, 2020, and the combined entity’s compliance with all applicable criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq at the time of the merger. We failed to meet certain of the conditions contained in the extension grant and have submitted a modified extension request to the Staff. We have not received a response from the Staff as of yet and cannot give assurance that we won't be delisted prior to August 10, 2020. 16 Results of Operations Our entire activity since September 18, 2017 (inception) up to November 20, 2017 was in preparation for our Initial Public Offering. Since our Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we had a net income of $273,220, which consists of the forgiveness of previously recorded professional fees of $352,071, interest income on securities held in the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”) of $113,077, offset by operating expenses of $119,300 and a provision for income taxes of $72,628. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we had a net income of $187,965, which consists of interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $382,862, offset by operating costs of $163,181 and provision for income taxes of $31,716. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2020, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $6,192,007 (including approximately $143,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. To date, we have withdrawn approximately $676,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay our income and franchise taxes, of which approximately $121,000 was withdrawn during the three months ended March 31, 2020. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities amounted to $76,434. Net income of $273,220 was the result of the forgiveness of previously recorded professional fees in the amount of $352,071, interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $113,077, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $115,494 of cash for operating activities. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities amounted to $297,696. Net income of $187,965 was the result of interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $382,862, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $102,799 of cash for operating activities. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to effect our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of March 31, 2020, A/Z Property has loaned us an aggregate of $548,787 in order to pay our Non-Business Combination Related Expenses and extension payments. Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses may repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Notes, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. As of March 31, 2020, Investor has loaned us an aggregate of $1,631,869 in order to fund a portion of the extension payments. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor, officers and directors or their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, except as described above, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 17 Off-balance sheet financing arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2020. Contractual obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, utilities and administrative support provided to us. We began incurring these fees on November 20, 2017. Effective August 20, 2018, Sponsor agreed to stop charging us the monthly administrative fee. We have engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist us in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist us in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist us with our press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. We will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Common Stock subject to possible redemption We account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our condensed balance sheets. Net loss per common share We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Common stock subject to possible redemption which is not currently redeemable and is not redeemable at fair value, has been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per common share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not our income or losses. Recent accounting pronouncements Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements. I TEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we invested the funds held in the Trust Account in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest solely in United States Treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of the investments, we do not believe that there will be an associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 18 I TEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2020. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of March 31, 2020. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 19 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION I TEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. I TEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2020. As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report filed with the SEC. I TEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS On March 23, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved to amend its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination to July 23, 2020. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,433,721.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 (Unaudited) NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OP E RATIONS Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. All activity through September 30, 2019 relates to the Company’s formation, the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 6,900,000 units (the “Units”) that occurred on November 22, 2017, the simultaneous sale of 272,500 units (the “Private Placement Units”) in a private placement to Big Rock Partners Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), and the Company’s search for a target business with which to complete a Business Combination. The Company initially had until November 22, 2018 to complete a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipated that it could not consummate a Business Combination by November 22, 2018, the Company could extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) (the “Combination Period”). Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on November 20, 2017, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees were required to deposit into the Trust Account $690,000 ($0.10 per share) for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of $1,380,000, or $0.20 per share, if the Company extended for the full six months, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On November 20, 2018, the period of time for the Company to consummate a Business Combination was extended for an additional three-month period ending on February 22, 2019, and, accordingly, $690,000 was deposited into the Trust Account. The deposit was funded by a non-interest bearing unsecured promissory note from BRAC Lending Group LLC, an affiliate of the underwriter (the “Investor”) (see Note 4). The note is repayable upon the consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 4). On February 21, 2019, the Company further extended the time required to consummate a Business Combination to May 22, 2019 and deposited an additional $690,000 into the Trust Account. If the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the Note will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company's Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company. On May 21, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company was required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,119,772. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extended Date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company deposited an aggregate of $286,814 into the Trust Account, of which $280,000 was contributed to the Trust Account by a third party and is not required to be repaid by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has recorded this amount as a credit to additional paid in capital in the accompanying condensed statements of stockholders’ equity. In order to pay for part of the third extension payment, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $6,814. The Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a Business Combination by the Company. If the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the Note will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company's Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company. Pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company had until August 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. On August 21, 2019, the Company stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “chapter”) to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Extension”) from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 846,888. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $8,891,378, or approximately $10.50 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extension. Through September 30, 2019, the Company deposited an aggregate of $157,334 into the Trust Account to fund the first two thirty day extension payments. In October 2019, the Company deposited an additional $78,667 into the Trust Account to fund an additional thirty day extension payment. The Company now has until November 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. In order to pay for the extension payments, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes in favor of the Sponsor and Investor in the aggregate principal amounts of $327,198 and $78,000, respectively (see Note 4). The promissory notes do not bear interest and mature upon closing of a Business Combination by the Company. If the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the promissory notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company's Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company. The Company has until November 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. The Company has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for November 21, 2019, pursuant to which it will seek stockholder approval to, among other matters, amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination from November 22, 2019 to March 23, 2020. If the Company's stockholders approve the amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, public stockholders may elect to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account. However, the Company may not redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause the Company's net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. There is no assurance that the Company's stockholders will vote to approve the extension of time with which the Company has to complete a Business Combination. If the Company does not obtain stockholder approval, the Company would wind up its affairs and liquidate. 5 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 (Unaudited) NASDAQ Notifications On January 7, 2019, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the “Staff”) stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company submitted a plan of compliance with Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted the Company an extension until May 22, 2019 to regain compliance with the rule by holding an annual meeting of stockholders. The Company held its annual meeting of stockholders on May 21, 2019 and, accordingly, the Staff determined that the Company is currently in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing and the matter was closed. On August 9, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders. The Company had until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company's securities on Nasdaq. On September 23, 2019 and October 28, 2019, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance of compliance with Nasdaq and requested an extension through February 5, 2020. On October 28, 2019, Nasdaq requested additional information regarding the Company's compliance plan, to which the Company responded on November 8, 2019. As of the date of this filing, the response from Nasdaq remains pending. If Nasdaq accepts the Company's plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notice to evidence compliance with the Rule. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company's plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. NOTE 2. LIQUIDITY As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $194,280 in its operating bank account, $41,477,046 in cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or convert stock in connection therewith and a working capital deficit of $300,476, which excludes franchise and income taxes payable of $133,239, of which such amounts will be paid from interest earned on the Trust Account. As of September 30, 2019, approximately $964,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company’s tax obligations. To date, the Company has withdrawn approximately $508,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Company’s taxes, of which approximately $466,000 was withdrawn during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and the Investor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018 and to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than Business Combination expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed. If a Business Combination is not consummated, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor will be forgiven (see Note 4). In addition, the Investor agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes (as defined in Note 4). If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination (see Note 4). The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Other than as described above, the Company’s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. The Company does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating its business. Neither the Sponsor, nor any of the stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties are under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, the Company, except as discussed above. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if the Company can obtain sufficient financing or raise additional capital, it only has until November 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so prior to November 22, 2019. 6 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 (Unaudited) NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2019, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019 or for any future interim periods. Use of estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company withdrew $465,993 of interest income to pay its franchise and income tax obligations. Net loss per common share Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at September 30, 2019 and 2018, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 3,586,250 shares of common stock, (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement that convert into 717,250 shares of common stock and (3) 600,000 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock and rights that convert into 60,000 shares of common stock in the unit purchase option sold to the underwriter, in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants, the conversion of the rights into shares of common stock and the exercise of the unit purchase option are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic income per common share for the periods presented. 7 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 (Unaudited) Reconciliation of net loss per common share The Company’s net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not the income or losses of the Company. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share is calculated as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income $ 59,195 $ 28,084 $ 423,181 $ 36,962 Less: Income attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption (159,486 ) (188,243 ) (658,996 ) (542,726 ) Adjusted net loss $ (100,291 ) $ (160,159 ) $ (235,815 ) $ (505,764 ) Weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 2,801,350 2,622,584 2,773,842 2,606,566 Basic and diluted net loss per common share $ (0.04 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.09 ) $ (0.19 ) NOTE 4. INVESTOR AGREEMENT AND PROMISSORY NOTES On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement with the Sponsor and the Investor. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founders Shares (as defined in Note 5) to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the Extensions”). On November 20, 2018 and February 21, 2019, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes (the “Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000 each (or an aggregate of $1,380,000), to provide the Company the funds necessary to obtain an aggregate of six-month Extensions. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. In connection with the stockholders approval of the Extended Date of August 22, 2019, the Company issued the Note in favor of the Investor in order to pay for part of the third extension payment in the original principal amount of $6,814. In connection with the stockholders approval of the Extension to November 22, 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note” and, together with the Note, the “Extension Notes”) in favor of the Investor in order to pay for part of the first two additional thirty day extension payments in the aggregate principal amount of $78,000. In October 2019, the Investor loaned the Company an additional $39,333 to pay for part of the extension payment in connection with the Extension to November 22, 2019 (see Note 7). If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes and Extension Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination. As of September 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under the Notes and Extension Notes amounted to an aggregate of $1,464,814. The Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company effective November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Company’s shareholders, as described in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by the Company to the Sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Notes, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. In September 2019, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor in the original principal amount of $327,198 to pay for Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. Of the amount loaned to the Company, $79,333 was used in order to pay for part of the extension payments in connection with the Extension to November 22, 2019. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven, except as set forth above. In October 2019, the Sponsor loaned the Company an additional $39,333 to pay for part of the extension payment in connection with the Extension to November 22, 2019 (see Note 7). As of September 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under promissory note amounted to $327,198. 8 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 (Unaudited) NOTE 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Registration Rights Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November 20, 2017, the holders of the Company’s common stock prior to the Initial Public Offering (the “Founder Shares”), Private Placement Units (and their underlying securities), the shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBirdCapital”) at the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Representative Shares”) and any Units that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans (and their underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder’s Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Placement Units or Units issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company (in each case, including the underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital and its designees may participate in a “piggy-back” registration during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Business Combination Marketing Agreement The Company has engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist the Company in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. NOTE 6.

NOTE 7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the condensed financial statements were issued. Other than as described below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed financial statements. In October 2019, the Company deposited into the Trust Account an aggregate of $78,667 in connection with the extension to November 22, 2019. The Company now has until November 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. In order to pay for the extension payment, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes in favor of the Investor and the Sponsor, each in the original principal amount of $39,333. The notes do not bear interest and mature upon the closing of a Business Combination by the Company. If the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company’s Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company. The Company has until November 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. The Company has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for November 21, 2019, pursuant to which it will seek stockholder approval to, among other matters, amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination from November 22, 2019 to March 23, 2020. The Company has agreed that if the extension amendment proposal is approved and the extension is implemented, it will deposit into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share that is not converted in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the extension, for each monthly period,or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete an initial business combination from November 22, 2019 until March 23, 2020. There is no assurance that the Company's stockholders will vote to approve the extension of time with which the Company has to complete a Business Combination. If the Company does not obtain stockholder approval, the Company would wind up its affairs and liquidate. 9 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial Business Combination are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt. Recent Developments On November 17, 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and BRAC Lending Group LLC (the “Investor”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founders Shares to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to take all actions reasonably necessary to extend the period of time we have to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan us the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the “Extension(s)”). On November 20, 2018, we issued an unsecured promissory note (the “First Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000, to provide us the funds necessary to obtain the first three-month Extension. On November 20, 2018, we issued a press release announcing that we had obtained the first three-month Extension to complete a Business Combination from November 22, 2018 to February 22, 2019. On February 21, 2019, we issued a second unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note, and together with the First Note, the “Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000, to provide us the funds necessary to obtain the second three-month Extension. On February 22, 2019, we issued a press release announcing that we had obtained the second three-month Extension to complete a Business Combination from February 22, 2019 to May 22, 2019. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan us all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. Also, pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all our liabilities effective November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by our shareholders, as described in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan us the funds necessary to pay our expenses other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for us to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Note, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. 10 The Founder’s Shares transferred by the Sponsor to the Investor will remain in escrow in the name of the Investor, subject to the terms of the Stock Escrow Agreement, dated November 20, 2017, among us, the Sponsor and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Additionally, the Sponsor assigned the registration rights it was granted, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 20, 2017 between us and the Sponsor, with respect to the Founder’s Shares to the Investor in connection with the transfer. On May 21, 2019, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which we are required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,119,772. We paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders. We agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on our behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extended Date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we deposited an aggregate of $286,814 into the Trust Account, of which $280,000 was contributed to the Trust Account by a third party and is not required to be repaid by us. In order to pay for part of the extension payment, we issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $6,814. The Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a Business Combination. If we fail to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the Note will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all of our other fees and expenses. Pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company had until August 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. On August 21, 2019, the Company stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “chapter”) to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination (the “Extension”) from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 846,888. We paid cash in the aggregate amount of $8,891,378, or approximately $10.50 per share, to redeeming stockholders. We agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on our behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extension. Through September 30, 2019, we deposited an aggregate of $157,334 into the Trust Account to fund the first two 30-day extension payments. In October 2019, we deposited an additional $78,667 into the Trust Account to fund an additional 30-day extension payment. We now have until November 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. In order to pay for the extension payments, we issued unsecured promissory notes in favor of the Sponsor and Investor in the aggregate principal amounts of $327,198 and $78,000, respectively (see Note 4). The promissory notes do not bear interest and mature upon closing of a Business Combination by the Company. If the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the promissory notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company's Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company. The Company has until November 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. The Company has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for November 21, 2019, pursuant to which it will seek stockholder approval to, among other matters, amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination from November 22, 2019 to March 23, 2020. If the Company's stockholders approve the amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, public stockholders may elect to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account. However, the Company may not redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause the Company's net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. There is no assurance that the Company's stockholders will vote to approve the extension of time with which the Company has to complete a Business Combination. If the Company does not obtain stockholder approval, the Company would wind up its affairs and liquidate. On August 9, 2019, we received a notice from the Staff stating that we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders. We had until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the listing or trading of our securities on Nasdaq. On September 23, 2019 the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq and requested an extension through February 5, 2020. As of the date of this filing, the response from Nasdaq is pending. If Nasdaq accepts our plan, Nasdaq may grant us an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notice to evidence compliance with the Rule. If Nasdaq does not accept our plan, we will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. Results of Operations Our entire activity since September 18, 2017 (inception) up to November 20, 2017 was in preparation for our Initial Public Offering. Since our Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we had a net income of $59,195, which consists of interest income on securities held in the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”) of $258,236, offset by operating costs of $183,305 and provision for income taxes of $15,736. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we had a net income of $423,181, which consists of interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $1,033,537, offset by operating costs of $522,228 and provision for income taxes of $88,128. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, we had a net income of $28,084, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $283,390, offset by operating costs of $220,243, an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $74 and a provision for income taxes of $34,989. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we had net income of $36,962, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $769,441, offset by operating costs of $684,427 and a provision for income taxes of $48,052. 11 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2019, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $41,477,046 (including approximately $964,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. To date, we have withdrawn approximately $508,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay our income and franchise taxes, of which approximately $466,000 was withdrawn during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, cash used in operating activities amounted to $530,657. Net income of $423,181 was the result of interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $1,033,537, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $79,699 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, cash used in operating activities amounted to $402,303. Net income of $36,962 was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $769,441. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $330,176 of cash for operating activities. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to effect our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of September 30, 2019, the Sponsor has loaned us an aggregate of $327,198 in order to pay our Non-Business Combination Related Expenses and extension payments. Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Note, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor, officers and directors or their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, except as described above, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. Off-balance sheet financing arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2019. Contractual obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 12 Common stock subject to possible redemption We account for our common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. Net loss per common share We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the trust account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not our income or losses. Recent accounting pronouncements Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. ITEM 3. QUA N TITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we invested the funds held in the Trust Account in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest solely in United States Treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of the investments, we do not believe that there will be an associated material exposure to interest rate risk. ITEM 4. CO N TROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2019. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2019 (Unaudited) NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Although the Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, the Company is focusing on businesses in the senior housing and care industry in the United States. All activity through June 30, 2019 relates to the Company’s formation, the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 6,900,000 units (the “Units”) that occurred on November 22, 2017, the simultaneous sale of 272,500 units (the “Private Placement Units”) in a private placement to Big Rock Partners Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), and the Company’s search for a target business with which to complete a Business Combination. The Company initially had until November 22, 2018 to complete a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipated that it could not consummate a Business Combination by November 22, 2018, the Company could extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) (the “Combination Period”). Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on November 20, 2017, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees were required to deposit into the Trust Account $690,000 ($0.10 per share) for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of $1,380,000, or $0.20 per share, if the Company extended for the full six months, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On November 20, 2018, the period of time for the Company to consummate a Business Combination was extended for an additional three month period ending on February 22, 2019, and, accordingly, $690,000 was deposited into the Trust Account. The deposit was funded by a non-interest bearing unsecured promissory note from BRAC Lending Group LLC, an affiliate of the underwriter (the “Investor”)(see Note 4). The note is repayable upon the consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 4). On February 21, 2019, the Company further extended the time required to consummate a Business Combination to May 22, 2019 and deposited an additional $690,000 into the Trust Account. On May 21, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,119,772. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders. The Company agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extended Date. Through June 30, 2019, the Company deposited an aggregate of $191,209 into the Trust Account, which was contributed to the Trust Account by a third party and is not required to be repaid by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has recorded this amount as a credit to additional paid in capital in the accompanying condensed statements of stockholders’ equity. In July 2019, the Company deposited an additional $95,605 into the Trust Account for the third, and final, 30-day extension period. The Company now has until August 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination (see Note 7). In order to pay for part of the third extension payment, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $6,814. The Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a Business Combination by the Company. If the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the Note will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company's Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company. The Company has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for August 21, 2019, pursuant to which it will seek stockholder approval to, among other matters, amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. There is no assurance that the Company’s stockholders will vote to approve the extension of time with which the Company has to complete a Business Combination. If the Company does not obtain stockholder approval, the Company would wind up its affairs and liquidate (see Note 7). NASDAQ Notification On January 7, 2019, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the “Staff”) stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company submitted a plan of compliance with Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted the Company an extension until May 22, 2019 to regain compliance with the rule by holding an annual meeting of stockholders. The Company held its annual meeting of stockholders on May 21, 2019 and, accordingly, the Staff determined that the Company is currently in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing and the matter was closed. On August 9, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders. The Company has until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company's securities on Nasdaq. The Company intends to submit a plan to regain compliance within the required timeframe. If Nasdaq accepts the Company's plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notice to evidence compliance with the Rule. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company's plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. 5 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2019 (Unaudited) NOTE 2. LIQUIDITY As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $1,394 in its operating bank account, $50,061,450 in cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or convert stock in connection therewith and a working capital deficit of $371,171, which excludes franchise and income taxes payable of $108,703, of which such amounts will be paid from interest earned on the Trust Account. As of June 30, 2019, approximately $1,112,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company’s tax obligations. To date, the Company has withdrawn approximately $304,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Company’s taxes, of which approximately $262,000 was withdrawn during the six months ended June 30, 2019. On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and the Investor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018 and to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than Business Combination expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed. If a Business Combination is not consummated, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor will be forgiven (see Note 4). In addition, the Investor agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes (as defined in Note 4). If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination (see Note 4). The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Other than as described above, the Company’s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. The Company does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating its business. Neither the Sponsor, nor any of the stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties are under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, the Company, except as discussed above. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if the Company can obtain sufficient financing or raise additional capital, it only has until August 22, 2019 (or November 22, 2019, if the extension amendment is approved) to consummate a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so prior to August 22, 2019 (or November 22, 2019, if the extension amendment is approved). NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2019, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The interim results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019 or for any future interim periods. Use of estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 6 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2019 (Unaudited) Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company withdrew $261,793 of interest income to pay its franchise tax obligations. Net loss per common share Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 3,586,250 shares of common stock, (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement that convert into 717,250 shares of common stock and (3) 600,000 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock and rights that convert into 60,000 shares of common stock in the unit purchase option sold to the underwriter, in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants, the conversion of the rights into shares of common stock and the exercise of the unit purchase option are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic income per common share for the periods presented. Reconciliation of net loss per common share The Company’s net income (loss) is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not the income or losses of the Company. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share is calculated as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net income (loss) $ 176,021 $ (6,602 ) $ 363,986 $ 8,879 Less: Income attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption (259,727 ) (158,321 ) (518,924 ) (355,325 ) Adjusted net loss $ (83,706 ) $ (164,923 ) $ (154,938 ) $ (346,446 ) Weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 2,794,297 2,605,782 2,759,859 2,598,424 Basic and diluted net loss per common share $ (0.03 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.13 ) NOTE 4. INVESTOR AGREEMENT AND PROMISSORY NOTES On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement with the Sponsor and the Investor. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founders Shares (as defined in Note 5) to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the Extensions”). On November 20, 2018 and February 21, 2019, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes (the “Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000 each (or an aggregate of $1,380,000), to provide the Company the funds necessary to obtain an aggregate of six-month Extensions. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under the Notes amounted to an aggregate of $1,380,000. 7 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2019 (Unaudited) The Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Company’s shareholders, as described in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by the Company to the Sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Notes, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. At June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under this loan amounted to $206,865. NOTE 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Registration Rights Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November 20, 2017, the holders of the Company’s common stock prior to the Initial Public Offering (the “Founder Shares”), Private Placement Units (and their underlying securities), the shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBirdCapital”) at the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Representative Shares”) and any Units that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans (and their underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder’s Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Placement Units or Units issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company (in each case, including the underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital and its designees may participate in a “piggy-back” registration during the seven year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Business Combination Marketing Agreement The Company has engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist the Company in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. NOTE 6. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2019 (Unaudited) NOTE 7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the condensed financial statements were issued. Other than as described below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed financial statements. In July 2019, the Company deposited $95,605 into the Trust Account for the third, and final, 30-day extension period. The Company now has until August 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. In order to pay for part of the third extension payment, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $6,814. The Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a Business Combination by the Company. If the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the Note will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Company's Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company. The Company has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for August 21, 2019, pursuant to which it will seek stockholder approval to, among other matters, amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. There is no assurance that the Company’s stockholders will vote to approve the extension of time with which the Company has to complete a Business Combination. If the Company does not obtain stockholder approval, the Company would wind up its affairs and liquidate. On August 9, 2019, the Company received a notice from the Staff stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders. The Company has until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the listing or trading of the Company's securities on Nasdaq. The Company intends to submit a plan to regain compliance within the required timeframe. If Nasdaq accepts the Company's plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notice to evidence compliance with the Rule. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company's plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. 9 ITEM 2.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). While our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial Business Combination will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we intend to initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the senior housing and care industry in the United States. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt. Recent Developments On November 17, 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and BRAC Lending Group LLC (the “Investor”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founders Shares to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to take all actions reasonably necessary to extend the period of time we have to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan us the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the “Extension(s)”). On November 20, 2018, we issued an unsecured promissory note (the “First Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000, to provide us the funds necessary to obtain the first three-month Extension. On November 20, 2018, we issued a press release announcing that we had obtained the first three-month Extension to complete a Business Combination from November 22, 2018 to February 22, 2019. On February 21, 2019, we issued a second unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note, and together with the First Note, the “Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000, to provide us the funds necessary to obtain the second three-month Extension. On February 22, 2019, we issued a press release announcing that we had obtained the second three-month Extension to complete a Business Combination from February 22, 2019 to May 22, 2019. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan us all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. Also, pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all our liabilities as of November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by our shareholders, as described in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan us the funds necessary to pay our expenses other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for us to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Note, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. 10 The Founder’s Shares transferred by the Sponsor to the Investor will remain in escrow in the name of the Investor, subject to the terms of the Stock Escrow Agreement, dated November 20, 2017, among us, the Sponsor and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Additionally, the Sponsor assigned the registration rights it was granted, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 20, 2017 between us and the Sponsor, with respect to the Founder’s Shares to the Investor in connection with the transfer. On May 21, 2019, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which we are required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019 (the “Extended Date”). The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,119,772. We paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders. We agreed to deposit, or cause to be deposited on our behalf, into the Trust Account $0.02 for each public share outstanding for each 30-day extension period utilized through the Extended Date. Through June 30, 2019, we deposited an aggregate of $286,814 into the Trust Account, of which $191,209 was contributed to the Trust Account by a third party and is not required to be repaid by us. In July 2019, we deposited an additional $95,605 into the Trust Account for the third, and final, 30-day extension period. We now have until August 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. In order to pay for part of the third extension payment, we issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $6,814. The Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of a Business Combination. If we fail to consummate a Business Combination, the outstanding debt under the Note will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all of our other fees and expenses. We have scheduled a special meeting of stockholders for August 21, 2019, pursuant to which we will seek stockholder approval to, among other matters, amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which we are required to consummate a Business Combination from August 22, 2019 to November 22, 2019. There is no assurance that our stockholders will vote to approve the extension of time with which we have to complete a Business Combination. If we do not obtain stockholder approval, we would wind up its affairs and liquidate. On August 9, 2019, we received a notice from the Staff stating that we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) for continued listing due to its failure to maintain a minimum of 300 public holders. We have until September 23, 2019 to provide Nasdaq with a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance with the listing requirement. The notice is a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and has no current effect on the listing or trading of our securities on Nasdaq. We intend to submit a plan to regain compliance within the required timeframe. If Nasdaq accepts our plan, Nasdaq may grant us an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notice to evidence compliance with the Rule. If Nasdaq does not accept our plan, we will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. Results of Operations Our entire activity since September 18, 2017 (inception) up to November 20, 2017 was in preparation for our Initial Public Offering. Since our Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended June 30, 2019, we had a net income of $176,021, which consists of interest income on securities held in the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”) of $392,439, offset by operating costs of $175,742 and provision for income taxes of $40,676. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, we had a net income of $363,986, which consists of interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $775,301, offset by operating costs of $338,923 and provision for income taxes of $72,392. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, we had a net loss of $6,602, which consists of operating costs of $271,810 and a provision for income taxes of $8,948, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $272,482 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $1,674. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we had net income of $8,879, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $486,051 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $75, offset by operating costs of $464,184 and a provision for income taxes of $13,063. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $50,061,450 (including approximately $1,112,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. To date, we have withdrawn approximately $304,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay our income and franchise taxes, of which approximately $262,000 was withdrawn during the six months ended June 30, 2019. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, cash used in operating activities amounted to $478,343. Net income of $363,986 was the result of interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $775,301, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $67,028 of cash for operating activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, cash used in operating activities amounted to $334,900. Net income of $8,879 was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $486,051 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of $75. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $142,347 of cash for operating activities. 11 We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to effect our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of June 30, 2019, the Sponsor has loaned us an aggregate of $206,865 in order to pay our Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Note, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor, officers and directors or their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, except as described above, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. Off-balance sheet financing arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2019. Contractual obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Common stock subject to possible redemption We account for our common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. 12 Net loss per common share We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the trust account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not our income or losses. Recent accounting pronouncements Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we invested the funds held in the Trust Account in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest solely in United States Treasuries. Due to these short-term nature of the investments, we do not believe that there will be an associated material exposure to interest rate risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of June 30, 2019. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 13 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC on March 15, 2019. As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report filed with the SEC. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS On May 21, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved to amend its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period of time for which the Company is required to consummate a Business Combination to August 22, 2019. The number of shares of common stock presented for redemption in connection with the extension was 2,119,772. The Company paid cash in the aggregate amount of $22,099,233, or approximately $10.43 per share, to redeeming stockholders.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2019 (Unaudited) N OTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). Although the Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, the Company is focusing on businesses in the senior housing and care industry in the United States. All activity through March 31, 2019 relates to the Company’s formation, the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 6,900,000 units (the “Units”) that occurred on November 22, 2017, the simultaneous sale of 272,500 units (the “Private Placement Units”) in a private placement to Big Rock Partners Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), and the Company’s search for a target business with which to complete a Business Combination. The Company initially had until November 22, 2018 to complete a Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipated that it could not consummate a Business Combination by November 22, 2018, the Company could extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) (the “Combination Period”). Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on November 20, 2017, in order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees were required to deposit into the Trust Account $690,000 ($0.10 per share) for each three month extension, up to an aggregate of $1,380,000, or $0.20 per share, if the Company extended for the full six months, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On November 20, 2018, the period of time for the Company to consummate a Business Combination was extended for an additional three month period ending on February 22, 2019, and, accordingly, $690,000 was deposited into the Trust Account. The deposit was funded by a non-interest bearing unsecured loan from BRAC Lending Group LLC, an affiliate of the underwriter (the “Investor”). The loan is repayable upon the consummation of a Business Combination (see Note 4). On February 21, 2019, the Company further extended the time required to consummate a Business Combination to May 22, 2019 and deposited an additional $690,000 into the Trust Account. NASDAQ Notification On January 7, 2019, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) for continued listing due to its failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company submitted a plan of compliance with Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted the Company an extension until May 22, 2019 to regain compliance with the rule by holding an annual meeting of stockholders. The Company has scheduled its annual meeting of stockholders for May 21, 2019 (see Note 7). NOTE 2. LIQUIDITY As of March 31, 2019, the Company had $1,818 in its operating bank account, $71,657,035 in cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or convert stock in connection therewith and a working capital deficit of $345,652, which excludes franchise and income taxes payable of $98,027, of which such amounts will be paid from interest earned on the Trust Account. As of March 31, 2019, approximately $1,277,000 of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account represented interest income, which is available to pay the Company’s tax obligations. To date, the Company has withdrawn approximately $224,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay the Company’s taxes, of which approximately $182,000 was withdrawn during the three months ended March 31, 2019. 5 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2019 (Unaudited) On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and the Investor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018 and to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than Business Combination expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed. If a Business Combination is not consummated, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor will be forgiven (see Note 4). In addition, the Investor agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes (as defined in Note 4). If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination (see Note 4). The Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Other than as described above, the Company’s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. The Company does not believe it will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating its business. Neither the Sponsor, nor any of the stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties are under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, the Company, except as discussed above. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Even if the Company can obtain sufficient financing or raise additional capital, it only has until May 22, 2019 to consummate a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so prior to May 22, 2019 (see Note 7). NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2019, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019 or for any future interim periods. Use of estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company withdrew $181,793 of interest income to pay its franchise tax obligations. 6 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2019 (Unaudited) Net loss per common share Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 3,586,250 shares of common stock, (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement that convert into 717,250 shares of common stock and (3) 600,000 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock and rights that convert into 60,000 shares of common stock in the unit purchase option sold to the underwriter, in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants, the conversion of the rights into shares of common stock and the exercise of the unit purchase option are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic income per common share for the periods presented. Reconciliation of net loss per common share The Company’s net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not the income or losses of the Company. Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share is calculated as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Net income $ 187,965 $ 15,481 Less: Income attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption (272,387 ) (185,056 ) Adjusted net loss $ (84,4228 ) $ (169,575 ) Weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 2,725,039 2,590,985 Basic and diluted net loss per common share $ (0.03 ) $ (0.07 ) NOTE 4. INVESTOR AGREEMENT AND PROMISSORY NOTES On November 17, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement with the Sponsor and the Investor. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founder’s Shares to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the Extensions”). On November 20, 2018 and February 21, 2019, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes (the “Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000 each (or an aggregate of $1,380,000), to provide the Company the funds necessary to obtain an aggregate of six-month Extensions. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans under the Notes will be forgiven, except to the extent of any funds held outside of the Trust Account after paying all other fees and expenses of the Company incurred prior to the date of such failure to consummate a Business Combination. As of March 31, 2019, the outstanding balance under the Notes amounted to an aggregate of $1,380,000. The Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Company’s shareholders, as described in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan the Company the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by the Company to the Sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Notes, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. At March 31, 2019, the outstanding balance under this loan amounted to $106,642. 7 BIG ROCK PARTNERS ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MARCH 31, 2019 (Unaudited) NOTE 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Registration Rights Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November 20, 2017, the holders of the Company’s common stock prior to the Initial Public Offering (the “Founder Shares”), Private Placement Units (and their underlying securities), the shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBirdCapital”) at the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Representative Shares”) and any Units that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans (and their underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder’s Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Placement Units or Units issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company (in each case, including the underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital and its designees may participate in a “piggy-back” registration during the seven year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Business Combination Marketing Agreement The Company has engaged EarlyBirdCapital as an advisor in connection with a Business Combination to assist the Company in holding meetings with its stockholders to discuss a potential Business Combination and the target business’ attributes, introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing securities, assist the Company in obtaining stockholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with a Business Combination. The Company will pay EarlyBirdCapital a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable). If a Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, no fee will be due or payable. NOTE 6. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. Common Stock — The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share.

NOTE 7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the condensed financial statements were issued. Other than as described below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed financial statements. The Company has scheduled its annual meeting of stockholders for May 21, 2019, pursuant to which it will seek stockholder approval to, among other matters, extend the time by which the Company has to complete a Business Combination from May 22, 2019 to August 22, 2019. There is no assurance that the Company’s stockholders will vote to approve the extension of time with which the Company has to complete a Business Combination. If the Company does not obtain stockholder approval, the Company would wind up its affairs and liquidate. 8 I TEM 2.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on September 18, 2017 and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). While our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial Business Combination will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we intend to initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the senior housing and care industry in the United States. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering, our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt. Recent Developments On November 17, 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Sponsor and BRAC Lending Group LLC (the “Investor”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founder’s Shares to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor agreed to take all actions reasonably necessary to extend the period of time we have to consummate a Business Combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan us the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the “Extension(s)”). On November 20, 2018, we issued an unsecured promissory note (the “First Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000, to provide us the funds necessary to obtain the first three-month Extension. On November 20, 2018, we issued a press release announcing that we had obtained the first three-month Extension to complete a Business Combination from November 22, 2018 to February 22, 2019. On February 21, 2019, we issued a second unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note, and together with the First Note, the “Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000, to provide us the funds necessary to obtain the second three-month Extension. On February 22, 2019, we issued a press release announcing that we had obtained the second three-month Extension to complete a Business Combination from February 22, 2019 to May 22, 2019. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan us all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a Business Combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. Also, pursuant to the Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all our liabilities as of November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by our shareholders, as described in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Sponsor has also agreed to loan us the funds necessary to pay our expenses other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a Business Combination when and as needed in order for us to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Note, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. The Founder’s Shares transferred by the Sponsor to the Investor will remain in escrow in the name of the Investor, subject to the terms of the Stock Escrow Agreement, dated November 20, 2017, among us, the Sponsor and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Additionally, the Sponsor assigned the registration rights it was granted, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 20, 2017 between us and the Sponsor, with respect to the Founder’s Shares to the Investor in connection with the transfer. 9 We have scheduled our annual meeting of stockholders for May 21, 2019, pursuant to which we will seek stockholder approval to, among other matters, extend the time by which we have to complete a Business Combination from May 22, 2019 to August 22, 2019. There is no assurance that our stockholders will vote to approve the extension of time with which we have to complete a Business Combination. If we do not obtain stockholder approval, we would wind up our affairs and liquidate. Results of Operations Our entire activity since September 18, 2017 (inception) up to November 20, 2017 was in preparation for our Initial Public Offering. Since our Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we had a net income of $187,965, which consists of interest income on securities held in the trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”) of $382,862, offset by operating costs of $163,181 and provision for income taxes of $31,716. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we had a net income of $15,481, which consists of interest income on securities held in the Trust Account of $213,569, offset by operating costs of $192,374, an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $1,599, and a provision for income taxes of $4,115. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2019, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $71,657,035 (including approximately $1,277,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. To date, we have withdrawn approximately $224,000 of interest from the Trust Account in order to pay our income and franchise taxes, of which approximately $182,000 was withdrawn during the three months ended March 31, 2019. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities amounted to $297,696. Net income of $187,965 was the result of interest earned on securities held in the Trust Account of $382,862, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $102,799 of cash for operating activities. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities amounted to $197,817. Net income of $15,481 was the result of interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $213,569, offset by an unrealized loss on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of $1,599 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $1,328 of cash for operating activities. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business or businesses and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to effect our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of March 31, 2019, the Sponsor has loaned us an aggregate of $106,642 in order to pay our Non-Business Combination Related Expenses. Upon consummation of a Business Combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by us to the Sponsor provided that we have funds available to us sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Note, and any funds necessary for our working capital requirements following closing of the Business Combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If we do not consummate a Business Combination, all outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven. We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor, officers and directors or their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, except as described above, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 10 Off-balance sheet financing arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2019. Contractual obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Common stock subject to possible redemption We account for our common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheets. Net loss per common share We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the trust account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject to possible redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not our income or losses. Recent accounting pronouncements Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. I TEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we invested the funds held in the Trust Account in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest solely in United States Treasuries. Due to these short-term nature of the investments, we do not believe that there will be an associated material exposure to interest rate risk. I TEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2019. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of March 31, 2019. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 11 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION I TEM 1.

Item 3. Item 4. PART II Item 1. Item 1A. Item 2. Item 6. Item 2: Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. Wyatt Acquisition On May 16, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt Technology, LLC and its three operating subsidiaries, Wyatt Technology Europe GmbH, Wyatt Technology France and Wyatt Technology UK Ltd. (collectively, “Wyatt”), for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories, and services. The acquisition will expand Waters’ portfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications. The Company financed this transaction with a combination of cash on its balance sheet and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Company’s financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include the financial results of the Wyatt acquisition from the acquisition date. Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Revenues: Product sales Service sales Total net sales Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales Selling and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Purchased intangibles amortization Acquired in-process research and development Operating income Operating income as a % of sales Other income, net Interest expense, net Income before income taxes Provision for income taxes Net income Net income per diluted common share 28 The Company’s net sales increased less than one percent in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to the third quarter of 2022, with foreign currency translation having an insignificant impact on sales growth. For the first nine months of 2023, the Company’s net sales increased 1% with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 2% as compared to the first nine months of 2022. In both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the Company’s net sales were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in sales in China due to lower customer demand for our products. Excluding China, the Company’s net sales increased 7% and 5% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The Wyatt acquisition increased sales growth by 4% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. For the first nine months of 2023, the Company had the same amount of calendar days when compared to the first nine months of 2022. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects that foreign currency translation will be negative to sales for the remainder of 2023. Instrument system sales decreased 5% and 4% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, as sales growth in the U.S., Latin America and Europe was offset by weaker customer demand in Asia (primarily in China). Instrument system sales in China declined 32% and 23% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, due to lower customer demand for our products. Excluding China, the Company’s instrument system sales increased 4% and 3% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The decline in China’s instrument sales can be attributed to the decline in customer demand. The Wyatt acquisition increased instrument system sales growth by 7% and 3%, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Foreign currency translation increased instrument system sales growth by 1% in the third quarter of 2023 and decreased instrument system sales growth by 1% in the first nine months of 2023. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 6% and 5% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, with foreign currency translation having a minimal impact on sales growth in the third quarter and decreasing sales growth by 2% for the first nine months of 2023. Service revenues grew 8% and 6% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Wyatt’s service revenues added 3% and 1% to service revenue growth for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Chemistry sales growth was flat and increased 3% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Chemistry sales were significantly impacted by the lower customer demand in China for our products. Excluding the impact of China, the Company’s chemistry sales grew 9% and 6%, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Operating income decreased 7% and 6% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, primarily due to higher salary expenses related to merit compensation and an increase in severance-related costs associated with a workforce reduction, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. In July 2023, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction that has impacted approximately 5% of the Company’s employees. The Company incurred approximately $23 million and $27 million of severance-related costs in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The Company paid $12 million and $14 million of severance-related costs in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, with the majority of the remaining costs to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first half of 2024. The Company estimates that the savings from this reduction in workforce will be approximately $48 million on an annual basis. In addition, the Company’s operating income was impacted by the Wyatt acquisition due diligence and integration costs of $1 million and $13 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, and the Wyatt acquisition related bonus expense of $8 million and $11 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The negative effect of foreign currency translation lowered operating income by approximately $2 million and $18 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The Company generated $373 million and $413 million of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities included $1.3 billion for the Wyatt acquisition in the first nine months of 2023 and capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $119 million and $114 million in the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company funded the Wyatt acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The Company’s outstanding debt on September 30, 2023 was $2.5 billion, a change of $1.0 billion from the end of the first quarter of 2023. The Company estimates that its interest expense for the full year 2023 will be approximately $80 million. As a result of the Wyatt acquisition, the Company temporarily suspended its share buyback program in the first quarter 2023. 29 Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Net Sales: Asia: China Japan Asia Other Total Asia Americas: United States Americas Other Total Americas Europe Total net sales Geographically, the Company’s sales growth in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was broad-based across most major regions, with the exception of China, which declined 27% and 17%, respectively. The decline in China was primarily driven by lower demand for our instrument systems and chemistry products. Excluding China, the Company’s net sales increased 7% and 5% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales growth in the third quarter and decreased sales growth by 2% in the first nine months of 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, sales increased 7% in the U.S. and 15% in Europe, while decreasing 15% in Asia driven by weakness in China and the negative effect of currency translation on sales in Japan. In the third quarter of 2023, foreign currency translation increased sales growth in Europe by 7% and decreased sales growth in Asia by 4%. This decline in Asia was primarily driven by the 8% decline in sales in Japan due to foreign currency translation. Wyatt’s sales contributed 9% of sales growth in the U.S. and 5% of sales growth in Europe in the third quarter of 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, sales increased 5% in the U.S. and 9% in Europe, while decreasing 8% in Asia driven by weakness in China, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales growth in Europe by 1% and decreasing sales growth in Asia by 4%, which includes a 9% decrease in sales in Japan resulting from foreign currency translation. 30 Sales by Trade Class Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Pharmaceutical Industrial Academic and government Total net sales During the third quarter of 2023, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 4%, as growth in the U.S. and Europe was offset by weakness in China, with foreign currency translation increasing pharmaceutical sales growth by 1% and Wyatt contributing 6% to the Company’s pharmaceutical sales growth. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, decreased 6% in the third quarter of 2023, with foreign currency translation having minimal impact on sales growth and Wyatt contributing 1% to industrial sales growth. Combined sales to academic and government customers increased 3% in the third quarter of 2023, with foreign currency translation having minimal impact on sales growth and Wyatt contributing 5% to the Company’s academic and government sales growth. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. During the first nine months of 2023, sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 2%, primarily driven by weakness in customer demand in China, with foreign currency translation decreasing pharmaceutical sales growth by 2%. Combined sales to industrial customers increased 1%, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1%. Combined sales to academic and government customers increased 20%, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 2%. 31 Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Waters instrument systems Chemistry consumables Total Waters product sales Waters service Total Waters net sales Nine Months Ended Waters instrument systems Chemistry consumables Total Waters product sales Waters service Total Waters net sales Waters products and service sales increased 1% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, with the effect of foreign currency translation having minimal impact on sales growth in the third quarter, while decreasing Waters sales growth by 1% in the first nine months of 2023. The Wyatt acquisition increased Waters products and service sales by approximately 5% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Waters instrument system sales decreased by 5% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 due to weaker customer demand in China. Waters instrument system sales in China declined 35% and 25% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on Waters instrument system sales growth in the third quarter while decreasing sales growth by 1% for the first nine months of 2023. Wyatt’s instrument system sales contributed 8% and 4% to Waters instrument system sales growth for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Waters chemistry consumables sales were significantly impacted by the lower customer demand in China for our products. Excluding the impact of China, the Company’s chemistry sales grew 9% and 6% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. This sales growth was primarily due to the continued strong demand in most major geographies, driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation, which decreased chemistry sales growth by 1% and 2% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Waters service sales increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 due to higher service demand billing, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation, which decreased service sales growth by 2% in the first nine months of 2023. Wyatt service revenues added 3% and 2% to Waters service revenue growth for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. 32 TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 (dollars in thousands): TA instrument systems TA service Total TA net sales Nine Months Ended TA instrument systems TA service Total TA net sales TA sales declined 3% for the third quarter of 2023 due to lower customer demand for TA products and services while TA sales grew 4% for the first nine months of 2023. For the third quarter, TA’s sales geographically were weak in the U.S., China and Asia Other, declining 8%, 5% and 13%, respectively, but were strong in Europe and Japan, which grew 7% and 19%, respectively. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 3% in Asia Other and 9% in Europe, while decreasing sales by 1% in China and 11% in Japan. For the first nine months of 2023, TA sales growth was broad-based across most major geographies, except for China and Asia Other, which declined 11% and 15%, respectively. The sales growth for the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by strong customer demand for our thermal analysis instruments and service, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 1% for the third quarter and decreased sales by 1% for the first nine months of 2023. Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased by 5% and 3% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The decrease in cost of sales in these periods is primarily due to the change in sales mix and the lower material and freight costs for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to be neutral to gross profit during 2023. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 14% and 15% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increase in these periods is primarily driven by severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce, which increased expenses by 14% and 5%; the Wyatt acquisition due diligence and integration costs, which increased expenses by 1% and 3%; and the Wyatt acquisition-related bonus expense, which increased expenses by 5% and 2%, in each case, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. The effect of foreign currency translation increased selling and administrative expenses by 2% for the third quarter and decreased expenses by 1% for the first nine months of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 26.2% and 26.0% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, and 23.2% and 22.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased 3% in the third quarter and increased 2% in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in third quarter research and development expenses was driven by lower incentive compensation costs, which were offset by annual merit increases and costs associated with the development of new product and technology initiatives. The impact of foreign currency exchange increased expenses by 1% for the third quarter and decreased expenses by 2% for the first nine months of 2023. 33 Purchased Intangibles Amortization The increase in purchased intangible amortization of $11 million and $16 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, can be attributed to the Wyatt acquisition intangible assets. Acquired In-Process Research & Development In 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the CDMS technology assets of Megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price, of which $5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. Other Income, net During the first nine months of 2022, the Company sold an equity investment for $10 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $7 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also incurred $6 million in losses on an equity investment within other income, net on the statement of operations. Interest Expense, net The increase in interest expense for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 can be primarily attributed to the additional borrowings by the Company to fund the Wyatt acquisition. The Company estimates that its interest expense for the full year 2023 will be approximately $80 million. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 25% and 17%, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. The Company has a Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income by $11 million and $15 million and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.18 and $0.25 for the third quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 and 2022 was 12.2% and 14.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate can be primarily attributed to the impact of discrete tax benefits in the current year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 and 2022 was 14.6% and 14.5%, respectively. The differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 34 Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Net income Depreciation and amortization Stock-based compensation Deferred income taxes Acquired in-process research and development and other non-cash items Change in accounts receivable Change in inventories Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities Change in deferred revenue and customer advances Other changes Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash used in investing activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents Decrease in cash and cash equivalents Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $373 million and $413 million during the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in 2023 operating cash flow was primarily a result of lower net income, higher inventory levels, higher income tax payments and the payment of acquired Wyatt liabilities, offset by higher cash collections in 2023 compared to 2022. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding was 81 days at September 30, 2023 and 77 days at October 1, 2022. The increase in inventory can primarily be attributed to higher material costs as well as an increase in safety stock levels to help mitigate any future supply chain issues. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. An increase in income tax payments of $79 million as compared to the prior year and the payment of $26 million in Wyatt acquired liabilities. Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion and $46 million in the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $119 million and $114 million in the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in 2023 and 2022 include $12 million and $24 million, respectively, of capital expenditures related to the major expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the United States. The Company has incurred costs of $245 million on this facility inception-to-date through the end of the first nine months of 2023 and anticipates completing this new state-of-the-art facility in 2023. 35 During the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, the Company purchased $2 million and $11 million of investments, respectively, while $2 million and $78 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company paid $5 million for the CDMS technology and intellectual property right asset from Megadalton, and the Company is required to make an additional $4 million of guaranteed payments at various dates in the future through 2029. The total purchase price of approximately $10 million was accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations in 2022. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company received $10 million in proceeds from equity investments and made $1 million of investments in equity investments. On May 16, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories, and services. The acquisition will expand Waters’ portfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications. Cash Flow from Financing Activities The Company had entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 governing the Company’s five-year, $1.8 billion revolving facility that matures in September 2026. On March 3, 2023, in anticipation of closing of the Wyatt acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the credit agreement governing its revolving credit facility (the “2023 Amendment”). The 2023 Amendment increases the borrowing capacity by $200 million to an aggregate total borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had a total of $2.5 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $1.2 billion borrowed under its credit agreement. The Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $0.9 billion and $30 million during the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily to fund the Wyatt acquisition. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had entered into interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with durations up to three years with an aggregate notional value of $625 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and yen-denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company lowered net interest expense by approximately $8 million and $6 million during the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $10 million in 2023. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors amended and extended this repurchase program’s term by one year such that it shall now expire on January 21, 2024 and increased the total authorization level to $4.8 billion, an increase of $750 million. During the first nine months of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company repurchased $58 million and $467 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under the share repurchase program. In addition, the Company repurchased $12 million and $11 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the first nine months of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, it has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to its acquisition of Wyatt. The Company received $18 million and $36 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $337 million as of September 30, 2023. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $307 million held by foreign subsidiaries at September 30, 2023, of which $196 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 36 Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 30, 2023 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2023, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, litigation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2023, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $307 million out of $337 million and $472 million out of $481 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $196 million out of $337 million and $336 million out of $481 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of September 30, 2023 would decrease by approximately $19 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. 39 Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of September 30, 2023 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion of certain factors under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company purchased 205 and 2,269 shares at a cost of $57 thousand and $634 thousand with average prices paid of $280.25 and $279.44 during fiscal July and September, respectively, of equity securities registered by the Company under the Exchange Act. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors amended and extended this repurchase program’s term by one year such that it shall now expire on January 21, 2024 and increased the total authorization level to $4.8 billion, an increase of $750 million. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 15.2 million shares at a cost of $3.8 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $1.0 billion authorized for future repurchases. The size and timing of these purchases, if any, will depend on our stock price and market and business conditions, as well as other factors. 40 Item 6: Exhibits Description of Document This exhibit shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any filing, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates it by reference. 41 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized. /s/ Amol Chaubal Date: November 7, 2023 42 ",0001000697,WAT

Exhibits Signature Item 2: Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. Wyatt Acquisition On May 16, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt Technology, LLC and its three operating subsidiaries, Wyatt Technology Europe GmbH, Wyatt Technology France and Wyatt Technology UK Ltd. (collectively, “Wyatt”), for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories, and services. The acquisition will expand Waters’ portfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications. The Company financed this transaction with a combination of cash on its balance sheet and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and six months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Revenues: Product sales Service sales Total net sales Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales Selling and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Purchased intangibles amortization Acquired in-process research and development (Note 1) Operating income Operating income as a % of sales Other income, net Interest expense, net Income before income taxes Provision for income taxes Net income Net income per diluted common share 27 The Company’s net sales increased 4% in the second quarter of 2023, as compared to the second quarter of 2022, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1%. For the first half of 2023, the Company’s net sales increased 1% with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 3% as compared to the first half of 2022. The Wyatt acquisition increased sales growth by 2% and 1% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. The analysis in the remainder of this section compares the Company’s net sales for the second quarter and first half of 2023 with the Company’s net sales for the second quarter and first half of 2022 and includes the effect of the Wyatt acquisition. In addition, the Company’s first half of 2023 included one less calendar day than the first half of 2022. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects that foreign currency translation would be neutral to sales for the remainder of 2023. Over the two-year period comparing the first half of 2023 to the first half of 2021, the Company’s net sales grew 5% annually. Instrument system sales increased 1% for the second quarter of 2023, as the strength in the U.S. and Europe was offset by weaker customer demand in China from our pharmaceutical customers. Excluding China, the Company’s instrument system sales increased 12% for the second quarter of 2023, which was broad-based across all existing and newly introduced LC, LC-MS and thermal analysis instrument systems. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales growth by 1% and 2% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 6% and 5% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 2% and 3% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. Operating income was flat and decreased 5% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, primarily driven by higher salary expenses related to merit compensation and additional headcount increases, and Wyatt acquisition due diligence and integration costs of $4 million and $12 million for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. The negative effect of foreign currency translation was minimal for the second quarter and lowered operating income by approximately $16 million for the first half of 2023. The Company generated $215 million and $255 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities included $1.3 billion for the Wyatt acquisition in the first half of 2023 and capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $81 million and $75 million in the first half of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company funded the Wyatt acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The Company’s outstanding debt on July 1, 2023 was $2.6 billion, a change of $1.2 billion from the end of the first quarter of 2023. The Company estimates that its interest expense for the full year 2023 will be approximately $80 million. As a result of the Wyatt acquisition, the Company temporarily suspended its share buyback program in the first quarter 2023. On March 3, 2023, in anticipation of closing of the Wyatt acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the credit agreement governing its revolving credit facility (the “2023 Amendment”). The 2023 Amendment increases the borrowing capacity by $200 million to an aggregate total borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion. In May 2023, the Company entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement with an aggregate amount of up to $400 million. In May 2023, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $100 million. The Series P $50 million notes have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.91%. The Series Q $50 million notes have a seven-year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.91%. In July 2023, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, that has impacted approximately 5% of the Company’s employees. The Company expects to incur approximately $30 million of severance related costs relating to this reduction in the third quarter of 2023. The Company estimates that the savings from this reduction in workforce will be approximately $45 million on an annual basis. 28 Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three and six months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Net Sales: Asia: China Japan Asia Other Total Asia Americas: United States Americas Other Total Americas Europe Total net sales Geographically, the Company’s sales growth in the second quarter and first half of 2023 was broad-based across all regions, with the exception of China which declined 17% and 11%, respectively. The decline in China was primarily driven by lower demand for our instrument systems by China’s pharmaceutical customers. Excluding China, the Company’s net sales would have increased 9% and 4% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. Foreign currency translation decreased total sales growth by 1% and 3% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. The significant impact of foreign currency translation in the first half of 2023 can be attributed to the significant U.S. dollar strengthening that started late in the first quarter of 2022 and has now annualized. During the second quarter of 2023, sales increased 12% in the U.S. and 13% in Europe, while decreasing 8% in Asia driven by weakness in China. Foreign currency translation increased sales growth in Europe by 1% and decreased sales growth in Asia by 3% in the second quarter of 2023. During the first half of 2023, sales increased 4% in the U.S. and 6% in Europe and decreased 5% in Asia driven by weakness in China, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth in Europe and Asia by 2% and 5%, respectively. Sales by Trade Class Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three and six months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Pharmaceutical Industrial Academic and government Total net sales 29 During the second quarter of 2023, sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 2%, as double-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe was offset by weakness in China, with foreign currency translation decreasing pharmaceutical sales growth by 1%. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 10% in the second quarter of 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1%. Combined sales to academic and government customers increased 23% in the second quarter of 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1%. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. During the first half of 2023, sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 5%, primarily driven by slower release of capital budgets by our customers, weakness in customer demand in China, and foreign currency translation which decreased pharmaceutical sales growth by 3%. Combined sales to industrial customers increased 5%, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 2%. Combined sales to academic and government customers increased 30%, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 4%. Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three and six months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Waters instrument systems Chemistry consumables Total Waters product sales Waters service Total Waters net sales Waters instrument systems Chemistry consumables Total Waters product sales Waters service Total Waters net sales Waters products and service sales increased 3% and 1% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing Waters sales growth by 1% and 2% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. Waters instrument system sales were flat and decreased 5% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, due to weaker customer demand in China from pharmaceutical customers. Foreign currency translation decreased Waters instrument system sales growth by 2% for the first half of 2023. The increase in Waters chemistry consumables sales was primarily due to the continued strong demand in most major geographies, driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased sales growth by 2% in both the second quarter and first half of 2023. Waters service sales increased in the second quarter and first half of 2023 due to higher service demand billing, particularly in China and Europe, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased service sales growth by 2% and 3% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. The Wyatt acquisition increased Waters products and service sales by approximately 2% and 1% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. 30 TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three and six months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands): TA instrument systems TA service Total TA net sales TA instrument systems TA service Total TA net sales TA instrument system and service sales growth in the second quarter and first half of 2023 was broad-based across most major geographies, increasing 10% and 9% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by 1% for both the second quarter and first half of 2023. The sales growth was primarily driven by strong customer demand for our thermal analysis instruments and services, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased by 2% and 1% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. The decrease in cost of sales in these periods is primarily due to the change in sales mix and the lower material and freight costs for both the second quarter and first half of 2023. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to be neutral to gross profit during 2023. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 15% and 16% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. The increases in these periods include the Wyatt acquisition due diligence and integration costs, which increased expenses by 2% and 4% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. The remaining increase is attributed to investment in headcount to support higher-growth adjacencies, annual merit compensation increases, normalization of travel expenses to pre-COVID levels and timing of investments associated with product launch. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 1% and 2% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 25.2% and 25.9% for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, and 22.7% for both the second quarter and first half of 2022. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 4% and 5% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. The increases in research and development expenses in these periods were impacted by additional headcount, higher salary expenses attributable to merit compensation increases and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased expenses by 2% and 3% in the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively. 31 Acquired In-Process Research & Development In 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the CDMS technology assets of Megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price, of which $5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. Other Income, net During the first half of 2022, the Company sold an equity investment for $7 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $4 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also incurred $4 million in losses on an equity investment within other income, net on the statement of operations. Interest Expense, net The increase in interest expense for both the second quarter and first half of can be primarily attributed to the additional borrowings to fund the Wyatt acquisition. The Company estimates that its interest expense for the full year 2023 will be approximately $80 million. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 25% and 17%, respectively, as of July 1, 2023. The Company has a Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income by $7 million and $10 million and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.11 and $0.16 for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 was 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate can be primarily attributed to the impact of discrete tax benefits in the prior year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first half of 2023 and 2022 was 15.6% and 14.3%, respectively. The differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Net income Depreciation and amortization Stock-based compensation Deferred income taxes Acquired in-process research and development and other non-cash items Change in accounts receivable Change in inventories Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities Change in deferred revenue and customer advances Other changes Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash used in investing activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents Decrease in cash and cash equivalents Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $215 million and $255 million during the first half of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in 2023 operating cash flow was primarily a result of lower net income, higher inventory levels, higher income tax payments and the payment of acquired Wyatt liabilities, offset by higher cash collections in 2023 compared to 2022. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding was 85 days at July 1, 2023 and 81 days at July 2, 2022. The increase in inventory can primarily be attributed to higher material costs as well as an increase in safety stock levels to help mitigate any future supply chain issues. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. An increase in income tax payments of $81 million as compared to the prior year and the payment of $26 million in Wyatt acquired liabilities. Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion and $7 million during the first half of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $81 million and $75 million in the first half of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in 2023 and 2022 include $9 million and $17 million, respectively, of capital expenditures related to the major expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the United States. The Company has incurred costs of $241 million on this facility through the end of the first half of 2023 and anticipates spending approximately $11 million to complete this new state-of-the-art facility for the remainder of 2023. 33 During the first half of 2023 and 2022, the Company purchased $1 million and $11 million of investments, respectively, while $1 million and $78 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. During the first half of 2022, the Company paid $5 million for the CDMS technology and intellectual property right asset from Megadalton, and the Company is required to make an additional $4 million of guaranteed payments at various dates in the future through 2029. The total purchase price of approximately $10 million was accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations in 2022. On May 16, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Wyatt for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion in cash. Wyatt is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories, and services. The acquisition will expand Waters’ portfolio and increase exposure to large molecule applications. Cash Flow from Financing Activities In June 2023, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $100 million. The Series P $50 million notes have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.91%. The Series Q $50 million notes have a seven-year term and a fixed interest rate of 4.91%. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. The Company had entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 governing the Company’s five-year, $1.8 billion revolving facility that matures in September 2026. On March 3, 2023 the Company entered into an agreement to amend such credit agreement. The 2023 Amendment increases the borrowing capacity by $200 million to an aggregate borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion. As of July 1, 2023, the Company had a total of $2.6 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $1,325 million borrowed under its credit agreement. The Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $1.1 billion and $30 million during the first half of 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily to fund the Wyatt acquisition. As of July 1, 2023, the Company has entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $625 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and yen-denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company lowered net interest expense by approximately $5 million and $4 million in the during the first half of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $10 million in 2023. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors amended and extended this repurchase program’s term by one year such that it shall now expire on January 21, 2024 and increased the total authorization level to $4.8 billion, an increase of $750 million. During the first half of July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022, the Company repurchased $58 million and $312 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under the share repurchase program. In addition, the Company repurchased $11 million and $10 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the first half of July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022, respectively. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, it has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to its acquisition of Wyatt. The Company received $9 million and $31 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the first half of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $331 million as of July 1, 2023. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $272 million held by foreign subsidiaries at July 1, 2023, of which $184 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 34 Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of July 1, 2023 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2023, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, litigation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the six months ended July 1, 2023. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the six months ended July 1, 2023.

Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of July 1, 2023, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $272 million out of $331 million and $472 million out of $481 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $184 million out of $331 million and $336 million out of $481 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of July 1, 2023, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of July 1, 2023 would decrease by approximately $19 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the six months ended July 1, 2023. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 1, 2023 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the 37 reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended July 1, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the six months ended July 1, 2023 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of July 1, 2023 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion of certain factors under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer During the three months ended July 1, 2023, the Company purchased 204, 491 and 149 shares at a cost of $62 thousand, $137 thousand and $38 thousand with average prices paid of $302.66, $278.06 and $256.45 during fiscal April, May and June, respectively, of equity securities registered by the Company under the Exchange Act. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors amended and extended this repurchase program’s term by one year such that it shall now expire on January 21, 2024 and increased the total authorization to $4.8 billion, an increase of $750 million. As of July 1, 2023, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 15.2 million shares at a cost of $3.8 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $1.0 billion authorized for future repurchases.

Item 2. Item 3. Item 4. PART II Item 1. Item 1A. Item 2. Item 6. Item 2: Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. COVID-19 Pandemic Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that has led to volatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of the emergence of variants of the virus, or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company’s manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom it outsources certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where the inventory is managed or the operations of its logistics and other service providers. 20 Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Revenues: Product sales Service sales Total net sales Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales Selling and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Purchased intangibles amortization Acquired in-process research and development Operating income Operating income as a % of sales Other income, net Interest expense, net Income before income taxes Provision for income taxes Net income Net income per diluted common share Percentage not meaningful The Company’s net sales decreased 1% in the first quarter of 2023 driven by weaker customer demand for our instrument systems as compared to the first quarter of 2022. Foreign currency translation decreased total sales growth by 4% in the first quarter of 2023 as the significant U.S. dollar strengthening that began in March of 2022 annualized, negatively impacting our sales and operating profits. In addition, the Company’s first quarter of 2023 had one less calendar day than the first quarter of 2022. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects that foreign currency translation would be neutral to sales for the remainder of 2023. Over the two-year period comparing the first quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2021, the Company’s net sales grew 6% annually. Instrument system sales decreased 7% primarily on weaker customer demand in the U.S., Europe and China in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the instrument system sales increase of 24% in the first quarter of 2022, which was broad-based across all existing and newly introduced LC, LC-MS and Thermal Analysis instrument systems. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales growth by 4% in the first quarter of 2023. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 4% in the first quarter of 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 4%. Operating income was $174 million in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of 11% as compared to $195 million in the first quarter of 2022. This decrease was primarily a result of higher salary expenses related to merit compensation and additional headcount increases, Wyatt acquisition due diligence costs and the negative effect of foreign currency translation which lowered operating income by approximately $16 million and $4 million during the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company generated $197 million and $198 million of net cash flows provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $34 million and $28 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 21 On February 14, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all issued and outstanding equity interests of Wyatt Technology for $1.4 billion in cash at closing, subject to customary adjustments. Wyatt Technology is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories and services. The Company will finance this acquisition through cash on its balance sheet and existing borrowing capacity that is available on its revolving credit facility. The agreement contains certain customary termination rights, including the right of the sellers to terminate this transaction if it has not been completed by June 14, 2023, subject to automatic extension to August 14, 2023 if certain regulatory approvals are not obtained by such date. If this were to occur, the Company would be required to pay the sellers a one-time fee in the amount of $15 million if the agreement is validly terminated and not consummated in accordance with the closing conditions set forth in the agreement. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors amended and extended this repurchase program’s term by one year such that it shall now expire on January 21, 2024 and increased the total authorization level by $750 million to $4.8 billion. During the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the Company repurchased $58 million and $160 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under the share repurchase programs. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, it has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to its recently announced agreement to acquire Wyatt Technology. On March 3, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the credit agreement governing its revolving credit facility (the “2023 Amendment”). The 2023 Amendment increases the borrowing capacity by $200 million to an aggregate total borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion. Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Net Sales: Asia: China Japan Asia Other Total Asia Americas: United States Americas Other Total Americas Europe Total net sales 22 Geographically, the Company’s sales decline in the first quarter of 2023 can be attributed to the sales growth in Asia Other and Americas Other being offset by lower customer demand for our instrument systems in the U.S., Europe and China. Sales growth in the first quarter of 2023 was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation across most major regions, decreasing total sales growth by 4% in the first quarter of 2023 as the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening that began in March 2022 annualized. The geographies that were the most negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2023 were Europe and Japan, as the weakening of the euro and Japanese yen lowered sales growth in Europe and Japan by 4% and 13%, respectively, in the quarter. Sales by Trade Class Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Pharmaceutical Industrial Academic and government Total net sales Sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 7% in the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a slower release of capital budgets by our customers and foreign currency translation decreasing pharmaceutical sales growth by 3%. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, were flat in the first quarter of 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 3%. Combined sales to academic and government customers increased 38% in the first quarter of 2023, with foreign currency translation decreasing academic and government sales growth by 7%. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Waters instrument systems Chemistry consumables Total Waters product sales Waters service Total Waters net sales Waters products and service sales decreased 2% in the first quarter of 2023, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing Waters sales growth by 4%. Waters instrument system sales decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2023 due to weaker customer demand in the U.S., Europe and China. The increase in Waters chemistry consumables sales was primarily due to the continued strong demand in most major geographies, driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased sales growth by 4%. Waters service sales increased in the first quarter of 2023 due to higher service demand billing, particularly in China and Europe, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased service sales growth by 5%. 23 TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 (dollars in thousands): TA instrument systems TA service Total TA net sales TA instrument system and service sales increased 6% and 8% in the first quarter of 2023, respectively, with foreign currency translation decreasing instrument system and service sales growth by 4% and 2%, respectively. The sales growth was primarily driven by strong customer demand for our thermal analysis instruments and services, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Cost of Sales Cost of sales were flat in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to the change in sales mix and the favorable impact from foreign currency translation which decreased costs by 1%. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to be neutral to gross profit during 2023. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 16% in the first quarter of 2023. This increase includes the Wyatt acquisition due diligence costs, which increased expenses by 6%. The remaining increase is attributed to investment in headcount to support higher-growth adjacencies, annual merit compensation increases, normalization of travel expenses to pre-COVID levels and timing of investments associated with product launch. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 3% in the first quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 26.6% and 22.8% for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 5% in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2023 was impacted by additional headcount, higher salary expenses attributable to merit compensation increases and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased expenses by 4% in the first quarter of 2023. Acquired In-Process Research & Development In 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the CDMS technology assets of Megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price, of which $5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. Other Income, net During the first quarter of 2022, the Company sold an equity investment for $7 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $4 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also incurred $4 million in losses on an equity investment within other income, net on the statement of operations. 24 Interest Expense, net Net interest expense in the first quarter of 2023 increased $1 million, which was primarily attributable to higher debt levels and higher interest rates on our variable rate debt balances. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 25% and 17%, respectively, as of April 1, 2023. The Company has a Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income by $3 million and $5 million and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.05 and $0.08 for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 was 14.7% and 14.4%, respectively. The income tax provision includes a $2 million and a $4 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 25 Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Net income Depreciation and amortization Stock-based compensation Deferred income taxes Acquired in-process research and development and other non-cash items Change in accounts receivable Change in inventories Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities Change in deferred revenue and customer advances Other changes Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities Net cash used in financing activities Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $197 million and $198 million during the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in 2023 operating cash flow was primarily a result of lower net income and higher inventory levels, offset by higher cash collections in 2023 compared to 2022. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding was 91 days at April 1, 2023 and 81 days at April 2, 2022. The increase in inventory can primarily be attributed to higher material costs as well as an increase in safety stock levels to help mitigate any future supply chain issues. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $34 million in the first quarter of 2023 and net cash provided by investing activities totaled $19 million in the first quarter of 2022. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $34 million and $28 million in the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in 2023 and 2022 include $4 million and $6 million, respectively, of capital expenditures related to the major expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the United States. The Company has incurred costs of $236 million on this facility through the end of the first quarter of 2023 and anticipates spending approximately $16 million to complete this new state-of-the-art facility for the remainder of 2023. During the first three months of 2023 and 2022, the Company purchased $1 million and $9 million of investments, respectively, while $1 million and $54 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. 26 During the first quarter of 2022, the Company paid $5 million for the CDMS technology and intellectual property right asset from Megadalton, and the Company is required to make an additional $4 million of guaranteed payments at various dates in the future through 2029. The total purchase price of approximately $10 million was accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations in 2022. On February 14, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all issued and outstanding equity interests of Wyatt Technology for $1.4 billion in cash at closing, subject to customary adjustments. Wyatt Technology is a pioneer in innovative light scattering and field-flow fractionation instruments, software, accessories and services. The Company will finance this acquisition through cash on its balance sheet and existing borrowing capacity that is available on its revolving credit facility. The agreement contains certain customary termination rights, including the right of the sellers to terminate this transaction if it has not been completed by June 14, 2023, subject to automatic extension to August 14, 2023 if certain regulatory approvals are not obtained by such date. If this were to occur, the Company would be required to pay the sellers a one-time fee in the amount of $15 million if the agreement is validly terminated and not consummated in accordance with the closing conditions set forth in the agreement. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Cash Flow from Financing Activities The Company entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 governing the Company’s five-year, $1.8 billion revolving facility that matures in September 2026. On March 3, 2023 the Company entered into an agreement to amend such credit agreement. The 2023 Amendment increases the borrowing capacity by $200 million to an aggregate borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had a total of $1.5 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $175 million borrowed under its credit agreement. The Company’s net debt borrowings decreased by $95 million and $70 million during the three months ended 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of April 1, 2023, the Company has entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value $585 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its euro-denominated and yen-denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company lowered net interest expense by approximately $3 million and $2 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company anticipates that these swap agreements will lower net interest expense by approximately $10 million in 2023. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors amended and extended this repurchase program’s term by one year such that it shall now expire on January 21, 2024 and increased the total authorization level to $4.8 billion, an increase of $750 million. During the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the Company repurchased $58 million and $160 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under the share repurchase program. In addition, the Company repurchased $11 million and $10 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the three months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, respectively. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, it has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to its recently announced agreement to acquire Wyatt Technology. The Company received $2 million and $13 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the first three months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $487 million as of April 1, 2023. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $313 million held by foreign subsidiaries at April 1, 2023, of which $188 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 27 Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of April 1, 2023 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2023, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, litigation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the three months ended April 1, 2023. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the three months ended April 1, 2023.

Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of April 1, 2023, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $313 million out of $487 million and $472 million out of $481 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $188 million out of $487 million and $336 million out of $481 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at April 1, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of April 1, 2023 would decrease by approximately $19 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.

Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 1, 2023 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended April 1, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Note, however, the discussion of certain factors under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. 31 Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer The following table provides information about purchases by the Company during the three months ended April 1, 2023 of equity securities registered by the Company under the Exchange Act (in thousands, except per share data): Period January 1, 2023 to January 28, 2023 January 29, 2023 to February 25, 2023 February 26, 2023 to April 1, 2023 Total The Company repurchased approximately 36 thousand shares of common stock at a cost of $11 million related to the vesting of restricted stock during the first three months of 2023. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors amended and extended this repurchase program’s term by one year such that it shall now expire on January 21, 2024 and increased the total authorization to $4.8 billion, an increase of $750 million. The size and timing of these purchases, if any, will depend on our stock price and market and business conditions, as well as other factors. 32 Item 6: Exhibits Description of Document This exhibit shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any filing, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates it by reference. 33 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

ntegral part of the consolidated financial statements. 9 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting P olicies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s third fiscal quarters for 2022 and 2021 ended on October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 24, 2022. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no interim goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption to the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could result in a material impact to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $ 409 million out of $ 445 million and $ 440 million out of $ 569 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 270 million out of $ 445 million and $ 298 million out of $ 569 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. 11 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Additions Deductions Balance at End of Period Allowance for Credit Losses October 1, 2022 $ 13,228 $ 4,980 $ ( 4,973 ) $ 13,235 October 2, 2021 $ 14,381 $ 3,388 $ ( 4,107 ) $ 13,662 Other Investments During the nine months ended October 1, 2022, the Company sold equity investments for $ 10 million in cash and recorded gains on the sales of approximately $ 7 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also incurred $ 6 million in losses on equity investments recorded within other income, net on the statement of operations. During the nine months ended October 2, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 10 million within other income, net on the statement of operations. This unrealized gain was recorded as an upward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at October 1, 2022 (in thousands): Total at October 1, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits 876 — 876 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 24,099 24,099 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 278 — 278 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 62,223 — 62,223 — Total $ 87,476 $ 24,099 $ 63,377 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,469 $ — $ — $ 1,469 Foreign currency exchange contracts 63 — 63 — Total $ 1,532 $ — $ 63 $ 1,469 12 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Total at December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 13,917 $ — $ 13,917 $ — Corporate debt securities 39,121 — 39,121 — Time deposits 19,030 — 19,030 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 38,729 38,729 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 504 — 504 — Total $ 111,301 $ 38,729 $ 72,572 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,347 $ — $ — $ 1,347 Foreign currency exchange contracts 195 — 195 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 5,363 — 5,363 — Total $ 6,905 $ — $ 5,558 $ 1,347 Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the December 2020 acquisition of Integrated Software Solutions (“ISS”) and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the achievement of certain revenue and customer account milestones over the two years after the acquisition date and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value of future contingent consideration payments related to the December 2020 acquisition of ISS was estimated to be $ 1 million at both October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 13 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s variable interest rate debt approximates fair value due to the variable nature of the interest rate. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 1.3 billion at both October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.3 billion at October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated and Yen-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of October 1, 2022, the Company had three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 585 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated and Yen-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. 14 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): October 1, 2022 December 31, 2021 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 42,690 $ 278 $ 55,309 $ 504 Other current liabilities $ 17,000 $ 63 $ 9,000 $ 195 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other assets $ 585,000 $ 62,223 $ — $ — Other liabilities — — 230,000 5,363 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 57,869 $ ( 15,944 ) The following is a summary of the activity included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized (losses) gains on closed contracts Cost of sales $ ( 3,811 ) $ ( 774 ) $ ( 6,603 ) $ 681 Unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts Cost of sales 461 ( 933 ) ( 93 ) ( 2,256 ) Cumulative net pre-tax losses Cost of sales $ ( 3,350 ) $ ( 1,707 ) $ ( 6,696 ) $ ( 1,575 ) Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 2,362 $ 2,305 $ 6,214 $ 9,505 Unrealized gains on open contracts Other comprehensive income $ 31,108 $ 7,762 $ 73,812 $ 24,777 Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. In Dec e mber 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. During both the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 467 million and $ 484 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 11 million and $ 9 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. As of October 1, 2022, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 14.6 million shares at a cost of $ 3.6 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 418 million authorized for future repurchase s. Product Warr a nty Cost s The Compan y accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company en g ages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. 15 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals for Warranties Settlements Made Balance at End of Period Accrued warranty liability: October 1, 2022 $ 10,718 $ 6,606 $ ( 6,663 ) $ 10,661 October 2, 2021 $ 10,950 $ 6,537 $ ( 6,991 ) $ 10,496 Other Items During the nine months ended October 1, 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the charge detection mass spectrometry technology (“CDMS technology”) assets of Megadalton Solutions, Inc. (“Megadalton”) were acquired for approximately $ 10 million in total purchase price, of which $ 5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $ 4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. This CDMS technology makes it possible to analyze extremely large proteins and protein complexes used in cell and gene therapies that would otherwise be difficult to analyze with conventional mass spectrometry. Once this technology is further developed, it will extend the capabilities of our mass spectrometry portfolio for a broader set of applications and as such the cost of this technology asset has been accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed in costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 (in thousands): October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 273,598 $ 239,759 Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period ( 213,527 ) ( 197,279 ) Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 243,853 264,184 Balance at the end of the period $ 303,924 $ 306,664 The Company classified $ 55 million and $ 46 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

The effect of foreign currency translation decreased goodwill by $ 18 million. 17 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (dollars in thousands): October 1, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Weighted- Average Amortization Period Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Weighted- Average Amortization Period Capitalized software $ 525,196 $ 391,250 5 years $ 575,658 $ 420,862 5 years Purchased intangibles 193,056 160,972 11 years 201,302 163,752 11 years Trademarks 9,680 — — 9,680 — — Licenses 12,739 5,848 6 years 12,635 6,199 7 years Patents and other intangibles 100,255 69,427 8 years 102,353 68,414 8 years Total $ 840,926 $ 627,497 7 years $ 901,628 $ 659,227 7 years The Company capitalized intangible assets in the amounts of $ 14 million and $ 18 million in the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively, and $ 38 million and $ 45 million in the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets decreased by $ 98 million and $ 76 million, respectively, in the nine months ended October 1, 2022 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 15 million for both the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 45 million for both the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 62 million per year for each of the next five years. 6 Debt The Company entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) governing the Company’s five-year , $ 1.8 billion revolving facility (the “2021 Credit Facility”) that expires in September 2026. As of October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the 2021 Credit Facility had a total of $ 240 million and $ 210 million outstanding, respectively. The interest rates applicable to the 2021 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2021 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2021 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2021 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of both October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had a total of $ 1.3 billion of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50 :1 18 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50 :1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. The Company had the following outstanding debt at October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands): October 1, 2022 December 31, 2021 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 $ 50,000 $ — Total notes payable and debt, current 50,000 — Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 — 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series L - 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series M - 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series N - 1.68 %, due March 2026 100,000 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series O - 2.25 %, due March 2031 400,000 400,000 Credit agreement 240,000 210,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 5,374 ) ( 6,130 ) Total long-term debt 1,494,626 1,513,870 Total debt $ 1,544,626 $ 1,513,870 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of both October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2021 Credit Agreement of $ 1.6 billion after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 3.24 % and 2.74 % at October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of October 1, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 111 million and $ 121 million at October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of October 1, 2022 or December 31, 2021. As of October 1, 2022, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 585 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated and Yen-denominated net asset investments. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of October 1, 2022. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 % on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 by $ 15 million and $ 13 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.25 and $ 0.20 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 was 14.9 % and 11.8 %, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the impact of favorable quarter-specific adjustments in the prior year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 19 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 was 14.5 % and 14.0 %, respectively. The differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for both the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 were $ 29 million. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2016. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of October 1, 2022, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of $ 18 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Other Commitments and Contingencies The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties in the course of ordinary business. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of October 1, 2022 are immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and thereafter. The Company enters into licensing arrangements with third parties that require future milestone or royalty payments contingent upon future events. Upon the achievement of certain milestones in existing agreements, the Company could make additional future payments of up to $ 2 million. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various stockholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of October 1, 2022, the 2020 Plan had 6.5 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 20 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of October 1, 2022, the Company had stock options, restricted stock, and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding under the 2020 Plan. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Cost of sales $ 478 $ 468 $ 2,420 $ 1,828 Selling and administrative expenses 8,174 4,116 23,607 15,810 Research and development expenses 1,555 1,769 4,902 4,311 Total stock-based compensation $ 10,207 $ 6,353 $ 30,929 $ 21,949 Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 are as follows: Nine Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Options issued in thousands 138 160 Risk-free interest rate 2.0 % 0.8 % Expected life in years 6 6 Expected volatility 30.7 % 32.4 % Expected dividends — — Nine Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Exercise price $ 321.12 $ 281.23 Fair value $ 107.95 $ 91.46 21 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the nine months ended October 1, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2021 691 $ 88.71 to $ 371.64 $ 202.24 Granted 138 $ 270.49 to $ 364.59 $ 321.12 Exercised ( 167 ) $ 88.71 to $ 279.90 $ 168.37 Canceled ( 40 ) $ 188.63 to $ 364.59 $ 253.23 Outstanding at October 1, 2022 622 $ 88.71 to $ 371.64 $ 234.43 Restricted Stock During the nine months ended October 1, 2022, the Company granted three thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 364.59 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the nine months ended October 1, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2021 245 $ 234.97 Granted 98 $ 322.99 Vested ( 76 ) $ 219.30 Forfeited ( 23 ) $ 256.22 Unvested at October 1, 2022 244 $ 273.20 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants made in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. 22 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 are as follows: Nine Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 40 41 Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 0.2 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.9 Expected volatility 25.4 % 38.7 % Average volatility of peer companies 34.5 % 34.7 % Correlation coefficient 43.0 % 45.8 % Expected dividends — — The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the nine months ended October 1, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2021 87 $ 285.73 Granted 40 $ 313.21 Vested ( 24 ) $ 308.71 Forfeited 8 $ 381.32 Unvested at October 1, 2022 111 $ 297.55 10 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended October 1, 2022 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 155,998 59,801 $ 2.61 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 280 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 155,998 60,081 $ 2.60 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Three Months Ended October 2, 2021 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 161,185 61,359 $ 2.63 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 529 ( 0.03 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 161,185 61,888 $ 2.60 Nine Months Ended October 1, 2022 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 480,693 60,200 $ 7.98 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 321 ( 0.04 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 480,693 60,521 $ 7.94 Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 476,604 61,771 $ 7.72 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 473 ( 0.06 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 476,604 62,244 $ 7.66 For the three and nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the Company had fewer than one million stock options that were antidilutive due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the applicable period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 11 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are detailed as follows (in thousands): Currency Translation Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Retirement Plans Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance at December 31, 2021 $ ( 99,985 ) $ ( 11,860 ) $ ( 20 ) $ ( 111,865 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax ( 54,255 ) 1,710 20 ( 52,525 ) Balance at October 1, 2022 $ ( 154,240 ) $ ( 10,150 ) $ — $ ( 164,390 ) 24 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 12 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans.

The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January of 2021, an update was issued to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions under the reference rate reform guidance for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in the reference rate reform guidance, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company does not believe that it has material reference rate exposure which would require utilizing the guidance under this accounting pronouncement and if adopted does not believe that this standard would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In October 2021, accounting guidance was issued that requires acquirers in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The new guidance requires that at the acquisition date, the acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with 606 as if it had originated the contracts. This guidance differs from current GAAP which requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers and other similar contracts that are accounted for in accordance with 606, at fair value on the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. The amendments within this update should be applied prospectively to business combinations on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption of the amendment is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The applicability of this standard is dependent on there being a busin ess combination activity and therefore the Company will evaluate the impact of thi s guidance when and if there is applicable activity. 27 Table of Contents Item 2: Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. COVID-19 Pandemic Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that has led to volatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of the emergence of variants of the virus, or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company’s manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom it outsources certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where the inventory is managed or the operations of its logistics and other service providers. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company successfully managed a significant delay in the receipt of certain materials and components from a supplier that was directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in China, and while the Company did not experience these significant delays in the third quarter of 2022, the Company cannot provide any assurances that any further disruptions in its logistics and supply chains will not have a significant impact on its future financial results and cashflows. The Company has taken decisive and appropriate actions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to take proactive measures to guard the health of its global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions. The Company has implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of its locations that are operational around the world and continues to closely monitor and update its multi-phase process for the safe return of employees to their physical workplaces as social distancing, governmental requirements, including capacity limitations, and other protocols allow. The vast majority of the markets the Company serves, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, materials sciences, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and the Company is working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation. 28 Table of Contents Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 % change October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 464,923 $ 419,133 11 % $ 1,385,393 $ 1,242,110 12 % Service sales 243,632 240,100 1 % 728,053 707,315 3 % Total net sales 708,555 659,233 7 % 2,113,446 1,949,425 8 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 307,101 271,128 13 % 899,992 805,529 12 % Selling and administrative expenses 164,417 152,545 8 % 483,769 453,954 7 % Research and development expenses 43,435 41,986 3 % 127,913 125,027 2 % Purchased intangibles amortization 1,592 1,759 (9 %) 4,863 5,408 (10 %) Acquired in-process research and development — — — 9,797 — * * Operating income 192,010 191,815 — 587,112 559,507 5 % Operating income as a % of sales 27.1 % 29.1 % 27.8 % 28.7 % Other income, net 895 (607 ) (247 %) 2,600 18,073 (86 %) Interest expense, net (9,524 ) (8,533 ) 12 % (27,362 ) (23,707 ) 15 % Income before income taxes 183,381 182,675 — 562,350 553,873 2 % Provision for income taxes 27,383 21,490 27 % 81,657 77,269 6 % Net income $ 155,998 $ 161,185 (3 %) $ 480,693 $ 476,604 1 % Net income per diluted common share $ 2.60 $ 2.60 — $ 7.94 $ 7.66 4 % ** Percentage not meaningful The Company’s net sales increased 7% and 8% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2021. The sales growth in these periods was driven by strong customer demand across most major geographies, end markets, and product categories. Foreign currency translation decreased total sales growth by 8% in the third quarter and 6% in the first nine months of 2022 as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against all currencies in the world, which negatively impacted our sales and operating profits. In addition, the Company’s first nine months of 2022 included one less calendar day than the first nine months of 2021. Instrument system sales increased 14% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, due to the broad-based increase in customer demand across all existing and newly introduced LC, LC-MS and Thermal Analysis instrument system sales. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales growth by 7% and 5% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 2% and 4% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 8% and 5% in the third quarter and the first nine months of the year, respectively. Operating income was flat and grew 5% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. The Company’s operating income in the third quarter of 2022 was flat with the prior year as sales volume and pricing increases were offset by higher electronic component and freight inflationary costs and the negative effect of foreign currency translation. The operating income increase for the first nine months was primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes and price increases being partially offset by an increase in electronic component and freight inflationary costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. 29 Table of Contents The Company generated $413 million and $529 million of net cash flows from operations in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. This decrease in operating cash flow can primarily be attributed to the increase in inventory levels due to the higher sales volumes, higher material inflation cost and the build-up of safety stock in an attempt to mitigate future supply chain issues. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $114 million and $117 million in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. During the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $467 million and $484 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits.

Foreign currency translation decreased total sales growth by 8% in the third quarter and 6% in the first nine months of 2022 as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against all currencies in the world. The geographies that were the most negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar were Europe and Japan. The Company’s sales in these geographies typically represent over 30% of our sales in a period, and the weakening of the Euro and Japanese Yen lowered sales growth in Europe and Japan by 15% and 22% for the third quarter, respectively, and 11% and 16% for the first nine months, respectively. During the third quarter of 2022, sales increased 10% in Asia and 11% in the Americas, but decreased 1% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth in Asia by 8% and in Europe by 15%. During the first nine months of 2022, sales increased 8% in Asia, 17% in the Americas, and decreased 1% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 6% in Asia, and 11% in Europe. China sales increased 21% and 16% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, driven by strong customer demand for our products and services. Foreign currency translation decreased China sales growth by 2% in the third quarter of 2022. The latest COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in China has made it difficult to conduct normal business operations in 2022 and may have a negative impact on the Company’s future sales growth if future lockdowns were to occur for a prolonged period. Sales increased 11% and 17% in the U.S. and 11% and 13% in India, respectively in the quarter 30 Table of Contents and for the first nine months of 2022, while sales decreased by 16% and 12% in Japan due to foreign currency translation, which decreased sales growth by 22% and 16% in Japan, respectively in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2022.

Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 14%, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 8% in the quarter. During the third quarter of 2022, combined sales to academic and government customers increased 21%, with foreign currency translation decreasing academic and government sales growth by 8%. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. During the first nine months of 2022, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 7%, driven by growth in most major regions on strong customer demand. Foreign currency translation decreased pharmaceutical sales growth by 5%.

Waters instrument systems grew 14% and 15% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, with foreign currency translation lowering sales growth by 7% and 5% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. The increase in the Waters instrument system sales can be attributed to the strong customer demand for our existing products as well as our newer Arc TM HPLC, ACQUITY TM Premier and XEVO TM TQ Absolute product introductions. The increase in Waters chemistry consumables sales was primarily due to the strong demand in most major geographies, driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers and partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation which decreased sales by 6%. Waters service sales increased due to higher service demand billing, particularly in China and the United States. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by one less calendar day in the first nine months of the year. In the third quarter of 2022, Waters sales increased 9% in the Americas and 10% in Asia, with sales in China increasing 22%, while sales in Europe and Japan decreased by 1% and 16%, respectively. Foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales growth by 1% in the Americas, 8% in Asia, 2% in China, 15% in Europe and 22% in Japan.

The increase in TA instrument system sales in the third quarter of 2022 was driven by strength in China and the Americas, while the increase in TA service sales was primarily due to the sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased TA’s sales growth by 8% and 5% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 13% and 12% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. The increase in cost of sales in these periods is primarily due to the increase in sales volume as well as an increase in electronic component and freight inflationary costs. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to significantly decrease gross profit for the remainder of 2022 and into the first half of 2023. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 8% and 7% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in these periods can be attributed to the salary merit and additional compensation due to an increase in the number of employees. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 7% and 4% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 23.2% and 22.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, and 23.1% and 23.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 3% and 2% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased expenses by 4% and 3% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. Acquired In-Process Research & Development During the first nine months of 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the CDMS technology assets of Megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price of which $5 million was 33 Table of Contents paid at closing and the remaining $4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. This CDMS technology makes it possible to analyze extremely large proteins and protein complexes used in cell and gene therapies that would otherwise be difficult to analyze with conventional mass spectrometry. Once this technology is further developed, we anticipate that it will extend the capabilities of our mass spectrometry portfolio for a broader set of applications and as such the cost of this technology asset has been accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations. Other Income (Expense), net During the first nine months of 2022, the Company sold equity investments for $10 million in cash and recorded gains on the sales of approximately $7 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also incurred $6 million in losses on equity investments within other income, net on the statement of operations. During the first nine months of 2021, the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve patent infringement litigation with Bruker Corporation and Bruker Daltronik GmbH regarding their timsTOF product line. In connection with the settlement, the Company is entitled to receive $10 million in guaranteed payments, including minimum royalty payments. During the first nine months of 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over. the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over. Interest Expense, net The net interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 increased $1 million and increased $4 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the first nine months of 2022 can be primarily attributed to the lower interest income benefit from the lower notional amount of interest rate cross currency swap agreements. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of October 1, 2022. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 by $15 million and $13 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.25 and $0.20 for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 was 14.9% and 11.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the impact of favorable quarter-specific adjustments in the prior year and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 was 14.5% and 14.0%, respectively. The differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Net income $ 480,693 $ 476,604 Depreciation and amortization 99,105 97,926 Stock-based compensation 30,929 21,949 Deferred income taxes (20,836 ) 9,219 Acquired in-process research and development and other non-cash items 10,003 — Change in accounts receivable (39,098 ) 23,472 Change in inventories (113,211 ) (93,878 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (4,952 ) (4,768 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 47,060 71,889 Other changes (76,741 ) (73,077 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 412,952 529,336 Net cash used in investing activities (45,783 ) (248,428 ) Net cash used in financing activities (398,187 ) (183,907 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (26,579 ) (8,994 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (57,597 ) $ 88,007 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $413 million and $529 million during the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. This decrease in operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher inventory levels due to higher sales volumes and higher incentive compensation payments in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the first nine months of 2021. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 77 days at October 1, 2022 as compared to 74 days at October 2, 2021. This increase is days sales outstanding is primarily due to delays in the timing of shipments to our customers from a supply chain issue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in China that occurred late in the second quarter of 2022. • The increase in inventory can be primarily attributed to higher material costs as well as an increase in safety stock levels to help mitigate any future supply chain issues. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $46 million and $248 million in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $114 million and $117 million in the first nine months October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in 2022 also included $24 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the United States. The Company has incurred costs of $221 million on this facility through the end of the first nine months of 2022, and anticipates spending approximately $30 million to complete this new state-of-the-art facility in 2022. 35 Table of Contents During the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, the Company purchased $11 million and $241 million of investments, respectively, while $78 million and $117 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company paid $5 million for the CDMS technology and intellectual property right asset from Megadalton, and the Company is required to make an additional $4 million of guaranteed payments at various dates in the future through 2029. The total purchase price of approximately $10 million was accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations in the first nine months of 2022. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company received $10 million in proceeds and made $1 million of investments in certain equity investments. Cash Flow from Financing Activities The Company entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 governing the Company’s five-year, $1.8 billion revolving facility that matures in September 2026. As of October 1, 2022, the Company had a total of $1.5 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $240 million borrowed under the 2021 Credit Agreement. During the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $30 million and increased by $260 million, respectively. As of October 1, 2022, the Company has entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value $585 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated and Yen-denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $9 million in 2022. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023.

The Company received $36 million and $55 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the first nine months 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $445 million as of October 1, 2022. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $409 million held by foreign subsidiaries at October 1, 2022, of which $270 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 1, 2022 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 36 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2022, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the nine months ended October 1, 2022. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the nine months ended October 1, 2022.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of October 1, 2022, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $409 million out of $445 million and $440 million out of $569 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $270 million out of $445 million and $298 million out of $569 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of October 1, 2022, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of October 1, 2022 would decrease by approximately $30 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the nine months ended October 1, 2022. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 1, 2022 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended October 1, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 39 Table of Contents Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended October 1, 2022 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of October 1, 2022 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion of certain factors under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s second fiscal quarters for 2022 and 2021 ended on July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 24, 2022. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no interim goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption to the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could result in a material impact to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $ 399 million out of $ 420 million and $ 440 million out of $ 569 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 270 million out of $ 420 million and $ 298 million out of $ 569 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. 11 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning Balance at End of of Period Additions Deductions Period Allowance for Credit Losses July 2, 2022 $ 13,228 $ 3,690 $ ( 3,571 ) $ 13,347 July 3, 2021 $ 14,381 $ 3,042 $ ( 2,625 ) $ 14,798 Other Investments During the six months ended July 2, 2022, the Company sold an equity investment for $ 7 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $ 4 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss on an equity method investment still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 4 million within other income, net on the statement of operations as the company entered into a sale process and we adjusted the carrying value of our investment based on our portion of the total proceeds we expect to receive. During the six months ended July 3, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 10 million within other income on the income statement. This unrealized gain was recorded as an upward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at July 2, 2022 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Markets Other Significant Total at for Identical Observable Unobservable July 2, Assets Inputs Inputs 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits 897 — 897 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 26,560 26,560 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 76 — 76 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 31,173 — 31,173 — Total $ 58,706 $ 26,560 $ 32,146 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,428 $ — $ — $ 1,428 Foreign currency exchange contracts 322 — 322 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 58 — 58 — Total $ 1,808 $ — $ 380 $ 1,428 12 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Markets Other Significant Total at for Identical Observable Unobservable December 31, Assets Inputs Inputs 2021 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 13,917 $ — $ 13,917 — Corporate debt securities 39,121 — 39,121 — Time deposits 19,030 — 19,030 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 38,729 38,729 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 504 — 504 — Total $ 111,301 $ 38,729 $ 72,572 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,347 $ — $ — $ 1,347 Foreign currency exchange contracts 195 — 195 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 5,363 — 5,363 — Total $ 6,905 $ — $ 5,558 $ 1,347 Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the December 2020 acquisition of Integrated Software Solutions (“ISS”) and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the achievement of certain revenue and customer account milestones over the two years after the acquisition date and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value of future contingent consideration payments related to the December 2020 acquisition of ISS was estimated to be $ 1 million at both July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 13 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s variable interest rate debt approximates fair value due to the variable nature of the interest rate. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 1.3 billion at both July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.3 billion at July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of July 2, 2022, the Company had three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. 14 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): July 2, 2022 December 31, 2021 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 17,000 $ 76 $ 55,309 $ 504 Other current liabilities $ 42,640 $ 322 $ 9,000 $ 195 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other assets $ 520,000 $ 31,173 $ — $ — Other liabilities 40,000 58 230,000 5,363 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 26,761 $ ( 15,944 ) The following is a summary of the activity included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements (in thousands): Financial Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Statement July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Classification Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized (losses) gains on closed contracts Cost of sales $ ( 1,292 ) $ ( 213 ) $ ( 2,791 ) $ 1,455 Unrealized losses on open contracts Cost of sales ( 66 ) ( 569 ) ( 555 ) ( 1,323 ) Cumulative net pre-tax (losses) gains Cost of sales $ ( 1,358 ) $ ( 782 ) $ ( 3,346 ) $ 132 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 2,077 $ 3,373 $ 3,852 $ 7,200 Unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts Other comprehensive income $ 30,516 $ ( 4,229 ) $ 42,704 $ 17,015 Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, the Company repurchased 1.0 million and 1.2 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 312 million and $ 339 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 10 million and $ 8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, respectively. As of July 2, 2022, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 14.1 million shares at a cost of $ 3.4 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 0.6 billion authorized for future repurchases. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. 15 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 (in thousands): Balance at Balance at Beginning Accruals for Settlements End of of Period Warranties Made Period Accrued warranty liability: July 2, 2022 $ 10,718 $ 4,084 $ ( 4,646 ) $ 10,156 July 3, 2021 $ 10,950 $ 4,719 $ ( 4,859 ) $ 10,810 Other Items During the six months ended July 2, 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the charge detection mass spectrometry technology (“CDMS technology”) assets of Megadalton Solutions, Inc. (“Megadalton”) were acquired for approximately $ 10 million in total purchase price, of which $ 5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $ 4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. This CDMS technology makes it possible to analyze extremely large proteins and protein complexes used in cell and gene therapies that would otherwise be difficult to analyze with conventional mass spectrometry. Once this technology is further developed, it will extend the capabilities of our mass spectrometry portfolio for a broader set of applications and as such the cost of this technology asset has been accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed in costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 (in thousands): July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 273,598 $ 239,759 Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period ( 173,606 ) ( 159,393 ) Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 240,928 251,065 Balance at the end of the period $ 340,920 $ 331,431 The Company classified $ 60 million and $ 46 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The amount of deferred revenue and customer advances equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period presented.

The effect of foreign currency translation decreased goodwill by $ 10 million. 17 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (dollars in thousands): July 2, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted- Weighted- Gross Average Gross Average Carrying Accumulated Amortization Carrying Accumulated Amortization Amount Amortization Period Amount Amortization Period Capitalized software $ 555,602 $ 411,492 5 years $ 575,658 $ 420,862 5 years Purchased intangibles 196,887 162,839 11 years 201,302 163,752 11 years Trademarks 9,680 — — 9,680 — — Licenses 11,484 6,091 7 years 12,635 6,199 7 years Patents and other intangibles 101,679 69,809 8 years 102,353 68,414 8 years Total $ 875,332 $ 650,231 7 years $ 901,628 $ 659,227 7 years The Company capitalized intangible assets in the amounts of $ 12 million and $ 19 mill i on in the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, respectively, and $ 24 million and $ 27 million in the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, respectively. The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets decreased by $ 50 million and $ 38 million, respectively, in the six months ended July 2, 2022 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 15 million for both the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 30 million for both the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 62 million per year for each of the next five years. 6 Debt The Company entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) governing the Company’s five-year , $ 1.8 billion revolving facility (the “2021 Credit Facility”) that expires in September 2026. As of July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the 2021 Credit Facility had a total of $ 180 million and $ 210 million outstanding, respectively. The interest rates applicable to the 2021 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2021 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2021 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2021 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of both July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had a total of $ 1.3 billion of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50 :1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50 :1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. 18 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had the following outstanding debt at July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands): July 2, 2022 December 31, 2021 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 $ 50,000 $ — Total notes payable and debt, current 50,000 — Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 — 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series L - 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series M - 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series N - 1.68 %, due March 2026 100,000 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series O - 2.25 %, due March 2031 400,000 400,000 Credit agreement 180,000 210,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 5,626 ) ( 6,130 ) Total long-term debt 1,434,374 1,513,870 Total debt $ 1,484,374 $ 1,513,870 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of both July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2021 Credit Agreement of $ 1.6 billion, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 3.02 % and 2.74 % at July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of July 2, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 113 million and $ 121 million at July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of July 2, 2022 or December 31, 2021. As of July 2, 2022, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of July 2, 2022. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 % on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 by $ 10 million and $ 9 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.16 and $ 0.14 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 was 14.3 % and 15.3 %, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the impact of quarter-specific adjustments and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 19 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 was 14.3 % and 15.0 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended July 2, 2022 includes a $ 5 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points for the six months ended July 2, 2022. The effective tax rate for the six months ended July 3, 2021 includes a $ 4 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points for the six months ended July 3, 2021. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for both the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 were $ 29 million. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2016. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of July 2, 2022, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of $ 18 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Other Commitments and Contingencies The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties in the course of ordinary business. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of July 2, 2022 are immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and thereafter. The Company enters into licensing arrangements with third parties that require future milestone or royalty payments contingent upon future events. Upon the achievement of certain milestones in existing agreements, the Company could make additional future payments of up to $ 2 million. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various stockholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of July 2, 2022, the 2020 Plan had 6.4 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not 20 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of July 2, 2022, the Company had stock options, restricted stock, and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding under the 2020 Plan. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Cost of sales $ 915 $ 727 $ 1,942 $ 1,360 Selling and administrative expenses 7,264 5,274 15,433 11,694 Research and development expenses 1,610 1,290 3,347 2,542 Total stock-based compensation $ 9,789 $ 7,291 $ 20,722 $ 15,596 Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 are as follows: Six Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Options issued in thousands 127 159 Risk-free interest rate 1.9 % 0.8 % Expected life in years 6 6 Expected volatility 30.9 % 32.5 % Expected dividends — — 21 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Six Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Exercise price $ 321.91 $ 280.92 Fair value $ 107.76 $ 91.42 The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the six months ended July 2, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2021 691 $ 88.71 to $ 371.64 $ 202.24 Granted 127 $ 314.98 to $ 364.59 $ 321.91 Exercised ( 150 ) $ 88.71 to $ 279.90 $ 170.44 Canceled ( 18 ) $ 203.37 to $ 364.59 $ 250.27 Outstanding at July 2, 2022 650 $ 88.71 to $ 371.64 $ 231.63 Restricted Stock During the six months ended July 2, 2022, the Company granted three thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 364.59 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the six months ended July 2, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2021 245 $ 234.97 Granted 94 $ 323.65 Vested ( 71 ) $ 220.07 Forfeited ( 16 ) $ 256.66 Unvested at July 2, 2022 252 $ 270.87 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants made in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. 22 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 are as follows: Six Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 40 41 Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 0.2 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.9 Expected volatility 25.4 % 38.7 % Average volatility of peer companies 34.5 % 34.7 % Correlation coefficient 43.0 % 45.8 % Expected dividends — — The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the six months ended July 2, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2021 87 $ 285.73 Granted 40 $ 313.21 Vested ( 24 ) $ 308.71 Forfeited 10 $ 370.15 Unvested at July 2, 2022 113 $ 298.05 10 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended July 2, 2022 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 164,864 60,206 $ 2.74 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 304 ( 0.02 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 164,864 60,510 $ 2.72 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Three Months Ended July 3, 2021 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 167,292 61,685 $ 2.71 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 472 ( 0.02 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 167,292 62,157 $ 2.69 Six Months Ended July 2, 2022 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 324,695 60,399 $ 5.38 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 345 ( 0.03 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 324,695 60,744 $ 5.35 Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 315,419 61,979 $ 5.09 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 456 ( 0.04 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 315,419 62,435 $ 5.05 For the three and six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, the Company had fewer than one million stock options that were antidilutive due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the applicable period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. 25 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as follows for the three and six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Product net sales: Waters instrument systems $ 280,846 $ 261,363 $ 550,808 $ 477,435 Chemistry consumables 131,947 126,459 257,565 245,433 TA instrument systems 56,837 53,133 112,097 100,109 Total product sales 469,630 440,955 920,470 822,977 Service net sales: Waters service 222,359 219,502 439,935 426,334 TA service 22,330 21,190 44,486 40,881 Total service sales 244,689 240,692 484,421 467,215 Total net sales $ 714,319 $ 681,647 $ 1,404,891 $ 1,290,192 Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January of 2021, an update was issued to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions under the reference rate reform guidance for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in the reference rate reform guidance, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company does not believe that it has material reference rate exposure which would require utilizing the guidance under this accounting pronouncement and if adopted does not believe that this standard would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In October 2021, accounting guidance was issued that requires acquirers in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The new guidance requires that at the acquisition date, the acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with 606 as if it had originated the contracts. This guidance differs from current GAAP which requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers and other similar contracts that are accounted for in accordance with 606, at fair value on the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. The amendments within this update should be applied prospectively to business combinations on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption of the amendment is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The applicability of this standard is dependent on there being a business combination activity and therefore the Company will evaluate the impact of this guidance when and if there is applicable activity. 2 7 Table of Contents Item 2: Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high-performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. COVID-19 Pandemic Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that has led to volatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of the emergence of variants of the virus, or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company’s manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom it outsources certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where the inventory is managed or the operations of its logistics and other service providers. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company successfully managed a significant delay in the receipt of certain materials and components from a supplier that was directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in China. The Company cannot provide any assurances that any further disruptions in its logistics and supply chains will not have a significant impact on its future financial results and cashflows. The Company has taken decisive and appropriate actions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to take proactive measures to guard the health of its global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions. The Company has implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of its locations that are operational around the world and continues to closely monitor and update its multi-phase process for the safe return of employees to their physical workplaces as social distancing, governmental requirements, including capacity limitations, and other protocols allow. The vast majority of the markets the Company serves, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, materials sciences, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and the Company is working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation. 28 Table of Contents Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 % change July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 469,630 $ 440,955 7 % $ 920,470 $ 822,977 12 % Service sales 244,689 240,692 2 % 484,421 467,215 4 % Total net sales 714,319 681,647 5 % 1,404,891 1,290,192 9 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 307,206 280,254 10 % 592,891 534,401 11 % Selling and administrative expenses 161,877 158,213 2 % 319,352 301,409 6 % Research and development expenses 44,006 44,949 (2 %) 84,478 83,041 2 % Purchased intangibles amortization 1,598 1,809 (12 %) 3,271 3,649 (10 %) Acquired in-process research and development (Note 1) — — — 9,797 — — Operating income 199,632 196,422 2 % 395,102 367,692 7 % Operating income as a % of sales 27.9 % 28.8 % 28.1 % 28.5 % Other income, net 1,535 9,321 (84 %) 1,705 18,680 (91 %) Interest expense, net (8,893 ) (8,329 ) 7 % (17,838 ) (15,174 ) 18 % Income before income taxes 192,274 197,414 (3 %) 378,969 371,198 2 % Provision for income taxes 27,410 30,122 (9 %) 54,274 55,779 (3 %) Net income $ 164,864 $ 167,292 (1 %) $ 324,695 $ 315,419 3 % Net income per diluted common share $ 2.72 $ 2.69 1 % $ 5.35 $ 5.05 6 % ** Percentage not meaningful The Company’s net sales increased 5% and 9% in the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first half of 2021. The sales growth in these periods was driven by strong customer demand across most major geographies, end markets, and product categories. Foreign currency translation decreased total sales growth by 5% in the second quarter and 4% in the first half of 2022 as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against all currencies in the world, which negatively impacted our sales and operating profits. In addition, the Company’s first half of 2022 included one less calendar day than the first half of 2021. Instrument system sales increased 7% and 15% for the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively, due to the broad-based increase in customer demand across all existing and newly introduced LC, LC-MS and Thermal Analysis instrument system sales. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales growth by 5% and 4% in the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 3% and 4% for the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 5% for both the second quarter and the first half of the year. Operating income increased 2% and 7% for the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. These increases were primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes and price increases being partially offset by an increase in electronic component and freight inflationary costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. The Company generated $255 million and $361 million of net cash flows from operations in the first half of 2022 and 2021, respectively. This decrease in operating cash flow can primarily be attributed to the delay in the timing of shipments in the second quarter caused a delay in the receipt of certain materials and components from a supplier that was directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in China, as well as an increase in inventory levels due to the higher sales volumes, higher material inflation cost and the build-up of safety stock in an attempt to mitigate future supply chain issues. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $75 million and $77 million in the first half of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 29 Table of Contents In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. During the first half of 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $312 million and $339 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits.

Foreign currency translation decreased total sales growth by 5% in the second quarter and 4% in the first half of 2022 as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against all currencies in the world. The geographies that were the most negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar were Europe and Japan. The Company’s sales in these geographies typically represent over 30% of our sales in a period, and the weakening of the Euro and Japanese Yen lowered sales growth in Europe and Japan by 11% and 16% for the second quarter, respectively, and 9% and 13% for the first half, respectively. During the second quarter of 2022, sales increased 3% in Asia and 14% in the Americas, but decreased 4% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth in Asia by 6% and in Europe by 11%. During the first half of 2022, sales increased 7% in Asia, 20% in the Americas, and decreased 1% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 4% in Asia, and 9% in Europe. China sales increased 9% and 13% in the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively, driven by strong customer demand for our products and services. The latest COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in China has made it difficult to conduct normal business operations in 2022 and may have a negative impact on the Company’s future sales growth if future lockdowns were to occur for a prolonged period. Sales increased 14% and 21% in the U.S. and 12% and 15% in India, respectively in the quarter and for the first half of 2022, while sales decreased by 17% and 10% in Japan due to foreign currency translation, which decreased sales growth by 16% and 13% in Japan, respectively in the second quarter and for the first half of 2022. 30 Table of Contents Sales by Trade Class Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three and six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Pharmaceutical $ 437,171 $ 416,705 $ 852,943 $ 776,853 Industrial 208,517 202,579 417,914 385,852 Academic and government 68,631 62,363 134,034 127,487 Total net sales $ 714,319 $ 681,647 $ 1,404,891 $ 1,290,192 During the second quarter of 2022, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 5%, driven by growth in most major regions, including 14% in China, 4% in India, and 12% in the Americas on strong customer demand. Foreign currency translation decreased pharmaceutical sales growth by 5% in the second quarter of 2022. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 3%, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 5% in the quarter. During the second quarter of 2022, combined sales to academic and government customers increased 10%, with foreign currency translation decreasing academic and government sales growth by 6%.

Waters instrument systems grew 7% and 15% for the second quarter and first half of 2022, 31 Table of Contents respectively, with foreign currency translation lowering sales growth by 5% and 4% for the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. The increase in the Waters instrument system sales can be attributed to the strong customer demand for our existing products as well as our newer Arc TM HPLC and ACQUITY TM Premier product introductions. The increase in Waters chemistry consumables sales was primarily due to the strong demand in the U.S., Europe, China and India, driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers. Waters service sales increased due to higher service demand billing, particularly in India and the United States. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by one less calendar day in the first half of the year. In the second quarter of 2022, Waters sales increased 16% in the Americas and 2% in Asia, with sales in China increasing 8%, while sales in Europe and Japan decreased by 4% and 17%, respectively. Foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales growth by 10% in Europe and 15% in Japan. In the first half of 2022, Waters sales decreased 1% in Europe, and sales increased 22% in the Americas and 5% in Asia, with sales in China increasing 11%. Foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales growth by 8% in Europe and 4% in Asia. TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three and six months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended July 2, 2022 % of Total July 3, 2021 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 56,837 72 % $ 53,133 71 % 7 % TA service 22,330 28 % 21,190 29 % 5 % Total TA net sales $ 79,167 100 % $ 74,323 100 % 7 % Six Months Ended July 2, 2022 % of Total July 3, 2021 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 112,097 72 % $ 100,109 71 % 12 % TA service 44,486 28 % 40,881 29 % 9 % Total TA net sales $ 156,583 100 % $ 140,990 100 % 11 % TA instrument system and service sales growth in the second quarter and first half of 2022 was broad-based across most major geographies increasing 7% and 11%, respectively, and was primarily driven by strong customer demand for our thermal analysis instruments and services. The increase in TA service sales was primarily due to the sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased TA’s sales growth by 5% and 4% in the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 10% and 11% for the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. The increase in cost of sales in these periods is primarily due to the increase in sales volume as well as an increase in electronic component and freight inflationary costs. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to significantly decrease gross profit for the remainder of 2022. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 2% and 6% for the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in these periods can be attributed to the salary merit and additional compensation due to an increase in the number of employees. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 4% and 3% for the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. 32 Table of Contents As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 22.7% for both the second quarter and first half of 2022 and 23.2% and 23.4% for the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased 2% in the second quarter of 2022, while increasing by 2% in the first half of 2022. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased expenses by 3% in the second quarter of 2022 and 2% in the first half of 2022. Acquired In-Process Research & Development During the first half of 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the CDMS technology assets of Megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price of which $5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. This CDMS technology makes it possible to analyze extremely large proteins and protein complexes used in cell and gene therapies that would otherwise be difficult to analyze with conventional mass spectrometry. Once this technology is further developed, we anticipate that it will extend the capabilities of our mass spectrometry portfolio for a broader set of applications and as such the cost of this technology asset has been accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations. Other Income, net During the first half of 2022, the Company sold an equity investment for $7 million in cash and recorded a gain on sale of approximately $4 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also recorded an other than temporary impairment loss on an equity method investment still held at the reporting date of approximately $4 million within other income, net on the statement of operations as the company entered into a sale process and we adjusted the carrying value of our investment based on our portion of the total proceeds we expect to receive. During the first half of 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over. Interest Expense, net The net interest expense in the second quarter and first half of 2022 increased by approximately $1 million and $3 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in both periods can be primarily attributable to the lower interest income benefit from the lower notional amount of interest rate cross currency swap agreements. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of July 2, 2022. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the first half of 2022 and 2021 by $10 million and $9 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.16 and $0.14 for the first half of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 was 14.3% and 15.3%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the impact of quarter-specific adjustments, as discussed below, and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 33 Table of Contents The Company’s effective tax rate for the first half of 2022 and 2021 was 14.3% and 15.0%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first half of July 2, 2022 includes a $5 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points for the first half of July 2, 2022. The effective tax rate for the first half of July 3, 2021 includes a $4 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points for the first half of July 3, 2021. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Six Months Ended July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Net income $ 324,695 $ 315,419 Depreciation and amortization 66,891 64,743 Stock-based compensation 20,722 15,596 Deferred income taxes (12,523 ) 6,107 Acquired in-process research and development and other non-cash items 7,903 — Change in accounts receivable (57,377 ) 18,985 Change in inventories (65,070 ) (50,873 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (32,197 ) (35,328 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 70,027 91,631 Other changes (68,208 ) (64,836 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 254,863 361,444 Net cash used in investing activities (7,403 ) (281,106 ) Net cash used in financing activities (310,181 ) (48,191 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (19,616 ) (8,786 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (82,337 ) $ 23,361 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $255 million and $361 million during the first half of 2022 and 2021, respectively. This decrease in operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher inventory levels due to higher sales volumes and higher incentive compensation payments in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 81 days at July 2, 2022 as compared to 73 days at July 3, 2021. This increase is days sales outstanding is primarily due to delays in the timing of shipments to our customers from a supply chain issue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in China. • The increase in inventory can be primarily attributed to higher material costs as well as an increase in safety stock levels to help mitigate any future supply chain issues. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $7 million and $281 million in the first half of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $75 million and $77 million in the first half July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in 2022 also included $17 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the United States. The Company has incurred costs of $215 million on this facility through the end of the first half of 2022 and anticipates spending approximately $30 million to complete this new state-of-the-art facility in 2022. 35 Table of Contents During the first half of 2022 and 2021, the Company purchased $11 million and $215 million of investments, respectively, while $78 million and $18 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. During the first half of 2022, the Company paid $5 million for the CDMS technology and intellectual property right asset from Megadalton, and the Company is required to make an additional $4 million of guaranteed payments at various dates in the future through 2029. The total purchase price of approximately $10 million was accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations in the first half of 2022. Cash Flow from Financing Activities The Company entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 governing the Company’s five-year, $1.8 billion revolving facility that matures in September 2026. As of July 2, 2022, the Company had a total of $1.5 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $180 million borrowed under the 2021 Credit Agreement. During the first half of 2022 and 2021, the Company’s net debt borrowings decreased by $30 million and increased by $250 million, respectively. As of July 2, 2022, the Company has entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value $560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $7 million in 2022. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. During the first half of 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $312 million and $339 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $10 million and $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the first half of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company received $31 million and $45 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the first half 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $420 million as of July 2, 2022. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $399 million held by foreign subsidiaries at July 2, 2022, of which $270 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of July 2, 2022 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2022, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. 36 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the six months ended July 2, 2022. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the six months ended July 2, 2022.

These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including: portions of our global workforce being unable to work fully and/or effectively due to working remotely, illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased risks of cyber attacks resulting from our temporary remote working model, disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities or to our supply chain and distribution network, including the impact from the lockdown in China, volatility and uncertainty in global capital markets limiting our ability to access capital, customers being unable to make timely payment for purchases, volatility in demand for our products and current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties; new or proposed tariffs or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; rising interest rates; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. • The impact and costs of war, in particular as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the possibility of further escalation resulting in a new geopolitical and regulatory instability. 38 Table of Contents Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of July 2, 2022, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $399 million out of $420 million and $440 million out of $569 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $270 million out of $420 million and $298 million out of $569 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of July 2, 2022, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of July 2, 2022 would decrease by approximately $30 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the first half July 2, 2022. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 2, 2022 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended July 2, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 39 Table of Contents Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended July 2, 2022 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of July 2, 2022 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion of certain factors under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer The following table provides information about purchases by the Company during the three months ended July 2, 2022 of equity securities registered by the Company under the Exchange Act (in thousands, except per share data): Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Programs Maximum Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Programs (2) April 3, 2022 to April 30, 2022 166 $ 302.44 166 $ 673,941 May 1, 2022 to May 28, 2022 156 $ 320.74 155 $ 624,106 May 29, 2022 to July 2, 2022 158 $ 326.65 158 $ 572,627 Total 480 $ 316.36 479 $ 572,627 (1) The Company repurchased approximately one thousand shares of common stock at a cost of less than $1 million related to the vesting of restricted stock during the three months ended July 2, 2022.

This program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023.

Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s first fiscal quarters for 2022 and 2021 ended on April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively.​​​​​​​ The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. ​​​​​​​ The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.​​​​​​​ It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 24, 2022. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 8 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no interim goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption to the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could result in a material impact to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $ 431 million out of $ 503 million and $ 440 million out of $ 569 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 324 million out of $ 503 million and $ 298 million out of $ 569 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. 9 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021(in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Additions Deductions Balance at End of Period Allowance for Credit Losses April 2, 2022 $ 13,228 $ 987 $ ( 1,072 ) $ 13,143 April 3, 2021 $ 14,381 $ 775 $ ( 1,561 ) $ 13,595 Other Investments During the three months ended April 2, 2022, the Company sold an equity investment for $ 7 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $ 4 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also recorded an other than temporary impairment loss on an equity method investment still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 4 million within other income, net on the statement of operations as the company entered into a sale process and we adjusted the carrying value of our investment based on our portion of the total proceeds we expect to receive. During the three months ended April 3, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 10 million within other income on the income statement. This unrealized gain was recorded as an upward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 10 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at April 2, 2022 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Markets Other Significant Total at for Identical Observable Unobservable April 2, Assets Inputs Inputs 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 4,796 $ — $ 4,796 $ — Corporate debt securities 5,605 — 5,605 — Time deposits 14,624 — 14,624 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 32,953 32,953 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 9 — 9 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 8,163 — 8,163 — Total $ 66,150 $ 32,953 $ 33,197 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,388 $ — $ — $ 1,388 Foreign currency exchange contracts 190 — 190 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 635 — 635 — Total $ 2,213 $ — $ 825 $ 1,388 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Markets Other Significant Total at for Identical Observable Unobservable December 31, Assets Inputs Inputs 2021 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 13,917 $ — $ 13,917 — Corporate debt securities 39,121 — 39,121 — Time deposits 19,030 — 19,030 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 38,729 38,729 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 504 — 504 — Total $ 111,301 $ 38,729 $ 72,572 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,347 $ — $ — $ 1,347 Foreign currency exchange contracts 195 — 195 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 5,363 — 5,363 — Total $ 6,905 $ — $ 5,558 $ 1,347 11 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the December 2020 acquisition of Integrated Software Solutions (“ISS”) and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the achievement of certain revenue and customer account milestones over the two years after the acquisition date and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value of future contingent consideration payments related to the December 2020 acquisition of ISS was estimated to be $ 1 million at both April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s variable interest rate debt approximates fair value due to the variable nature of the interest rate. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.3 billion at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.3 billion at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. 12 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of April 2, 2022, the Company had three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 550 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): April 2, 2022 December 31, 2021 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 10,509 $ 9 $ 55,309 $ 504 Other current liabilities $ 46,882 $ 190 $ 9,000 $ 195 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other assets $ 470,000 $ 8,163 $ — $ — Other liabilities 80,000 635 230,000 5,363 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 3,755 $ 15,944 13 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized (losses) gains on closed contracts Cost of sales $ ( 1,499 ) $ 1,667 Unrealized losses on open contracts Cost of sales ( 489 ) ( 753 ) Cumulative net pre-tax (losses) gains Cost of sales $ ( 1,988 ) $ 914 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 1,775 $ 3,827 Unrealized gains on contracts, net Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 12,188 $ 21,244 Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company repurchased 0.5 million and 0.6 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 160 million and $ 173 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 10 million and $ 8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. As of April 2, 2022, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 13.6 million shares at a cost of $ 3.3 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 0.7 billion authorized for future repurchases. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals for Warranties Settlements Made Balance at End of Period Accrued warranty liability: April 2, 2022 $ 10,718 $ 1,916 $ ( 2,422 ) $ 10,212 April 3, 2021 $ 10,950 $ 2,337 $ ( 2,582 ) $ 10,705 Other Items During the three months ended April 2, 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the charge detection mass spectrometry technology (“CDMS technology”) assets of Megadalton Solutions, Inc. (“Megadalton”) were acquired for approximately $ 10 million in total purchase price, of which $ 5 million was paid at closing and the 14 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) remaining $ 4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. This CDMS technology makes it possible to analyze extremely large proteins and protein complexes used in cell and gene therapies that would otherwise be difficult to analyze with conventional mass spectrometry. Once this technology is further developed, it will extend the capabilities of our mass spectrometry portfolio for a broader set of applications and as such the cost of this technology asset has been accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed in costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 (in thousands): April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 273,598 $ 239,759 Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period ( 103,355 ) ( 94,078 ) Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 198,036 182,384 Balance at the end of the period $ 368,279 $ 328,065 The Company classified $ 53 million and $ 47 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The amount of deferred revenue and customer advances equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period presented. Such amounts are expected to be recognized in the future as follows (in thousands): April 2, 2022 Deferred revenue and customer advances expected to be recognized in: One year or less $ 315,086 13- 24 months 32,877 25 months and beyond 20,316 Total $ 368,279 15 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 3 Marketable Securities The Company’s marketable securities within cash equivalents and investments included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (in thousands): April 2, 2022 Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cost Gain Loss Value U.S. Treasury securities $ 4,802 $ — $ ( 6 ) $ 4,796 Corporate debt securities 5,610 — ( 5 ) 5,605 Time deposits 14,624 — — 14,624 Total $ 25,036 $ — $ ( 11 ) $ 25,025 Amounts included in: Cash equivalents $ 2,000 $ — $ — $ 2,000 Investments 23,036 — ( 11 ) 23,025 Total $ 25,036 $ — $ ( 11 ) $ 25,025 December 31, 2021 Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cost Gain Loss Value U.S. Treasury securities $ 13,929 $ — $ ( 12 ) $ 13,917 Corporate debt securities 39,135 — ( 14 ) 39,121 Time deposits 19,030 — — 19,030 Total $ 72,094 $ — $ ( 26 ) $ 72,068 Amounts included in: Cash equivalents $ 4,017 $ — $ — $ 4,017 Investments 68,077 — ( 26 ) 68,051 Total $ 72,094 $ — $ ( 26 ) $ 72,068 The estimated fair value of marketable debt securities by maturity date is as follows (in thousands): April 2, 2022 December 31, 2021 Due in one year or less $ 25,025 $ 71,066 Due after one year through three years — 1,002 Total $ 25,025 $ 72,068 4 Inventories Inventories are classified as follows (in thousands): April 2, 2022 December 31, 2021 Raw materials $ 168,324 $ 165,240 Work in progress 24,087 19,726 Finished goods 189,491 171,129 Total inventories $ 381,902 $ 356,095 5 Goodwill and Other Intangibles The carrying amount of goodwill was $ 436 million and $ 438 million at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased goodwill by $ 2 million. 16 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (dollars in thousands): April 2, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted- Weighted- Gross Average Gross Average Carrying Accumulated Amortization Carrying Accumulated Amortization Amount Amortization Period Amount Amortization Period Capitalized software $ 576,013 $ 424,114 5 years $ 575,658 $ 420,862 5 years Purchased intangibles 200,284 164,372 11 years 201,302 163,752 11 years Trademarks 9,680 — — 9,680 — — Licenses 12,339 6,285 7 years 12,635 6,199 7 years Patents and other intangibles 102,493 69,630 8 years 102,353 68,414 8 years Total $ 900,809 $ 664,401 7 years $ 901,628 $ 659,227 7 years The Company capitalized $ 12 million and $ 8 million of intangible assets in the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets decreased by $ 13 million and $ 10 million, respectively, in the three months ended April 2, 2022 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 15 million for both the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 64 million per year for each of the next five years. 6 Debt The Company entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) governing the Company’s five-year , $ 1.8 billion revolving facility (the “2021 Credit Facility”) that expires in September 2026. As of April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the 2021 Credit Facility had a total of $ 140 million and $ 210 million outstanding, respectively. The interest rates applicable to the 2021 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2021 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2021 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2021 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of both April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had a total of $ 1.3 billion of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50 :1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50 :1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default . 17 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had the following outstanding debt at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands): April 2, 2022 December 31, 2021 Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series L - 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series M - 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series N - 1.68 %, due March 2026 100,000 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series O - 2.25 %, due March 2031 400,000 400,000 Credit agreement 140,000 210,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 5,878 ) ( 6,130 ) Total long-term debt 1,444,122 1,513,870 Total debt $ 1,444,122 $ 1,513,870 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2021 Credit Agreement of $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 2.88 % and 2.74 % at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of April 2, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 120 million and $ 121 million at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of April 2, 2022 or December 31, 2021. As of April 2, 2022, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 550 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of April 2, 2022. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 % on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 by $ 5 million and $ 4 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.08 and $ 0.06 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 was 14.4 % and 14.8 %, respectively. The income tax provision includes a $ 4 million and a $ 2 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting 18 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes.​​​​​​​ The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for both the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 were $ 29 million. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2016. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of April 2, 2022, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of $ 18 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Other Commitments and Contingencies The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties in the course of ordinary business. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of April 2, 2022 are immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and thereafter. The Company enters into licensing arrangements with third parties that require future milestone or royalty payments contingent upon future events. Upon the achievement of certain milestones in existing agreements, the Company could make additional future payments of up to $ 2 million. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various stockholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of April 2, 2022, the 2020 Plan had 6.4 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of April 2, 2022, the Company had stock options, restricted stock, and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding under the 2020 Plan. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line​​​​​​​ 19 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Cost of sales $ 1,027 $ 633 Selling and administrative expenses 8,169 6,420 Research and development expenses 1,737 1,252 Total stock-based compensation $ 10,933 $ 8,305 Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 are as follows: ​​​​​​​ Three Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Options issued in thousands 127 139 Risk-free interest rate 1.9 % 0.8 % Expected life in years 6 6 Expected volatility 30.9 % 33.1 % Expected dividends — — Three Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Exercise price $ 321.91 $ 277.32 Fair value $ 107.76 $ 91.63 20 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the three months ended April 2, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2021 691 $ 88.71 to $ 371.64 $ 202.24 Granted 127 $ 314.98 to $ 364.59 $ 321.91 Exercised ( 69 ) $ 88.71 to $ 279.90 $ 160.49 Canceled ( 6 ) $ 203.37 to $ 279.90 $ 235.95 Outstanding at April 2, 2022 743 $ 88.71 to $ 371.64 $ 226.30 Restricted Stock During the three months ended April 2, 2022, the Company granted three thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 364.59 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the three months ended April 2, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2021 245 $ 234.97 Granted 94 $ 323.65 Vested ( 68 ) $ 217.21 Forfeited ( 3 ) $ 228.76 Unvested at April 2, 2022 268 $ 270.65 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants made in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. 21 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 are as follows: Three Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 40 41 Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 0.2 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.9 Expected volatility 25.4 % 38.7 % Average volatility of peer companies 34.5 % 34.7 % Correlation coefficient 43.0 % 45.8 % Expected dividends — — The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the three months ended April 2, 2022 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2021 87 $ 285.73 Granted 40 $ 325.12 Vested ( 24 ) $ 308.71 Forfeited 11 $ 396.67 Unvested at April 2, 2022 114 $ 305.42 10 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 159,831 60,580 $ 2.64 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 372 ( 0.02 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 159,831 60,952 $ 2.62 Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 148,127 62,260 $ 2.38 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 372 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 148,127 62,632 $ 2.37 For the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company had 12 thousand and 123 thousand stock options that were antidilutive, respectively, due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. 23 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as follows for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Product net sales: Waters instrument systems $ 269,962 $ 216,072 Chemistry consumables 125,618 118,974 TA instrument systems 55,260 46,976 Total product sales 450,840 382,022 Service net sales: Waters service 217,576 206,832 TA service 22,156 19,691 Total service sales 239,732 226,523 Total net sales $ 690,572 $ 608,545 Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January of 2021, an update was issued to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions under the reference rate reform guidance for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in the reference rate reform guidance, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company does not believe that it has material reference rate exposure which would require utilizing the guidance under this accounting pronouncement and if adopted does not believe that this standard would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In October 2021, accounting guidance was issued that requires acquirers in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The new guidance requires that at the acquisition date, the acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with 606 as if it had originated the contracts. This guidance differs from current GAAP which requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers and other similar contracts that are accounted for in accordance with 606, at fair value on the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. The amendments within this update should be applied prospectively to business combinations on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption of the amendment is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The applicability of this standard is dependent on there being a business combination activity and therefore the Company will evaluate the impact of this guidance when and if there is applicable activity. 25 Item 2: Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. COVID-19 Pandemic Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that has led to volatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of the emergence of variants of the virus, or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted the Company’s manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom it outsources certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where its inventory is managed, or the operations of its logistics and other service providers. The Company also did not see material disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of its products. However, the current logistic and supply chain issues being experienced throughout the world have made it more difficult for us to manage our operations and as such we cannot provide any assurances that any further disruptions in the logistics and supply chains will not have a material impact on our future financial results and cashflows. The Company has taken decisive and appropriate actions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and continues to take proactive measures to guard the health of its global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions. The Company has implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of its locations that are operational around the world and continues to closely monitor and update its multi-phase process for the safe return of employees to their physical workplaces as social distancing, governmental requirements, including capacity limitations, and other protocols allow. The vast majority of the markets the Company serves, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, materials sciences, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and the Company is working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation. 26 Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 % Change Revenues: Product sales $ 450,840 $ 382,022 18 % Service sales 239,732 226,523 6 % Total net sales 690,572 608,545 13 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 285,685 254,147 12 % Selling and administrative expenses 157,475 143,196 10 % Research and development expenses 40,472 38,092 6 % Purchased intangibles amortization 1,673 1,840 (9 %) Acquired in-process research and development 9,797 — — Operating income 195,470 171,270 14 % Operating income as a % of sales 28.3 % 28.1 % Other income, net 170 9,359 (98 %) Interest expense, net (8,945 ) (6,845 ) 31 % Income before income taxes 186,695 173,784 7 % Provision for income taxes 26,864 25,657 5 % Net income $ 159,831 $ 148,127 8 % Net income per diluted common share $ 2.62 $ 2.37 11 % The Company’s net sales increased 13% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 driven by strong customer demand across most major geographies, end markets, and product categories. Foreign currency translation decreased total sales by 3% as the U.S. dollar strengthened versus most of the foreign currencies in the world in the quarter. In addition, the Company’s first quarter of 2022 had one less calendar day than the first quarter of 2021. Instrument system sales increased 24% in the first quarter, due to the broad-based increase in customer demand across all existing and newly introduced LC, LC-MS and Thermal Analysis instrument system sales. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales by 2%. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 6% in the first quarter, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales by 3%. Geographically, the Company’s sales growth in the first quarter was broad-based across most major regions as sales increased 11% in Asia, 26% in the Americas, and 3% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales by 3% in Asia and 6% in Europe. In addition, sales increased 28% in the U.S. and 17% in India, while sales decreased by 3% in Japan with foreign currency translation decreasing India and Japan’s sales growth rates by 6% and 9%, respectively. China sales increased 18%, driven by strong customer demand for our products and service for most the of the first quarter of 2022; however, the new COVID lockdowns in China put in place late in the first quarter of 2022 may have a negative impact on our future sales growth if these lockdowns continue for a prolonged period. Foreign currency translation increased China sales growth by 1% in the quarter. During the first quarter of 2022, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 15%, driven by growth in most regions, including 18% in China, 21% in India, and 32% in the Americas on a 37% sales increase in the United States on strong customer demand. Foreign currency translation decreased pharmaceutical sales growth by 4%. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 14%, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 3%. During the first quarter of 2022, combined sales to academic and government customers were flat, with foreign currency translation negatively impacting sales growth by 4%. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. 27 Operating income was $195 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 14% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. This increase in operating income was primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes and price increases being partially offset by an increase in electronic component and freight inflationary costs. During the first quarter 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition in which the charge detection mass spectrometry technology (“CDMS technology”) assets of Megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price of which $5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $ 4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. This CDMS technology makes it possible to analyze extremely large proteins and protein complexes used in cell and gene therapies that would otherwise be difficult to analyze with conventional mass spectrometry. Once this technology is further developed it will extend the capabilities of our mass spectrometry portfolio for a broader set of applications and as such the cost of this technology asset has been accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations. The Company generated $198 million and $218 million of net cash flows from operations in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. This decrease in cash flow from operations can primarily be attributed to an increase in inventory levels due to the higher sales volumes and the build-up of safety stock in an attempt to mitigate future supply chain issues. In addition, the Company paid a higher amount of incentive compensation in the 2022 quarter as compared to the 2021 quarter. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $28 million and $40 million in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. During the first quarters of 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $160 million and $173 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits. 28 Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 % change Net Sales: Asia: China $ 121,032 $ 102,919 18 % Japan 48,623 50,296 (3 %) Asia Other 84,679 76,327 11 % Total Asia 254,334 229,542 11 % Americas: United States 208,713 162,433 28 % Americas Other 40,124 34,924 15 % Total Americas 248,837 197,357 26 % Europe 187,401 181,646 3 % Total net sales $ 690,572 $ 608,545 13 % In the first quarter of 2022, sales benefited from stronger demand for our products and services across all major geographies and customer classes. The sales strength was broad-based, driven by continued growth in recurring revenues and the very strong sales growth in existing and newly introduced LC and LC-MS and Thermal Analysis instrument system sales. Recurring revenues sales growth was negatively impacted by one less calendar day in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021.

Foreign currency translation decreased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 4%. Sales to industrial customers increased 14% in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to an increase in customer demand. Foreign currency translation decreased sales to industrial customers by 3% in the first quarter of 2022. Sales to academic and government customers were flat in the first quarter of 2022, with foreign currency translation decreasing sales by 4%. 29 Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 % of Total April 3, 2021 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 269,962 44 % $ 216,072 40 % 25 % Chemistry consumables 125,618 21 % 118,974 22 % 6 % Total Waters product sales 395,580 65 % 335,046 62 % 18 % Waters service 217,576 35 % 206,832 38 % 5 % Total Waters net sales $ 613,156 100 % $ 541,878 100 % 13 % The effect of foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales by 3% for the first quarter. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) increased in the first quarter of 2022 driven by the strong broad-based sales performance across all key regions, with double-digit sales growth, primarily due to higher sales as a result of stronger demand for our products and services by our customers. Waters chemistry consumables sales increased in the first quarter of 2022, attributable to the increased demand in India, Asia Other, and the United States, driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers. Waters service sales increased due to higher service demand billings, particularly in India and the United States. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by one less calendar day and the impact of foreign currency translation which decreased sales by 4% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, Waters sales growth was broad-based and increased by 30% in the Americas, 2% in Europe, and 9% in Asia, with sales in China and India growing 13% and 17%, respectively. Foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales by 6% in Europe, 2% in Asia, and 6% in India, while increasing sales by 1% in China. TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three months ended April 2, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 % of Total April 3, 2021 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 55,260 71 % $ 46,976 70 % 18 % TA service 22,156 29 % 19,691 30 % 13 % Total TA net sales $ 77,416 100 % $ 66,667 100 % 16 % TA product and service sales were broad-based across most major geographies increasing 16% in the first quarter, driven by strong customer demand for our Thermal Analysis instruments and services. The increase in TA instrument system sales in the first quarter of 2022 was primarily driven by strength in China, Korea and Europe. The increase in TA service sales was primarily due to customers continuing to resume their operations after the restrictions caused by COVID-19, as well as sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased TA’s sales by 2%. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the first quarter of 2022 increased 12% primarily due to the increase in sales volume as well as an increase in electronic component and freight inflationary costs. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to decrease gross profit slightly for the remainder of 2022. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 10% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, selling and administrative expenses were impacted by higher merit and incentive compensation costs, compared to the first quarter of 2021. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 2% in the first quarter of 2022. 30 As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 22.8% and 23.5% for the first quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in this percentage is attributable to the increase in sales. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 6% in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased research and development expenses by 1% in the quarter. In-Process Research & Development During the three months ended April 2, 2022, the Company completed a technology and intellectual property right asset acquisition in which the charge detection mass spectrometry technology (“CDMS technology”) assets of Megadalton were acquired for approximately $10 million in total purchase price of which $5 million was paid at closing and the remaining $4 million will be paid in the future at various dates through 2029. This CDMS technology makes it possible to analyze extremely large proteins and protein complexes used in cell and gene therapies that would otherwise be difficult to analyze with conventional mass spectrometry. Once this technology is further developed, it is expected to extend the capabilities of our mass spectrometry portfolio for a broader set of applications and as such the cost of this technology asset has been accounted for as In-Process Research and Development and expensed in costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations. Other Income, net During the first quarter of 2022, the Company sold an equity investment for $7 million in cash and recorded a gain on sale of approximately $4 million in other income, net on the statement of operations. The Company also recorded an other than temporary impairment loss on an equity method investment still held at the reporting date of approximately $4 million within other income, net on the statement of operations as the company entered into a sale process and we adjusted the carrying value of our investment based on our portion of the total proceeds we expect to receive. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over. Interest Expense, Net The increase in net interest expense in the first quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to the lower interest income benefit from the lower notional amount of interest rate cross currency swap agreements. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of April 2, 2022. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the quarter in 2022 and 2021 by $5 million and $4 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.08 and $0.06, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the 2022 and 2021 quarters was 14.4% and 14.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective rate is primarily due to the income tax provision including a $4 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the first quarter 2022 as compared to a $2 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2021. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 31 Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Net income $ 159,831 $ 148,127 Depreciation and amortization 32,664 31,356 Stock-based compensation 10,933 8,305 Deferred income taxes 4,175 2,787 Acquired in-process research and development and other non-cash items 9,381 — Change in accounts receivable (907 ) 7,945 Change in inventories (26,832 ) (30,544 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (69,548 ) (29,758 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 91,514 89,048 Other changes (13,251 ) (8,862 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 197,960 218,404 Net cash used in investing activities 18,992 (159,004 ) Net cash used in financing activities (227,411 ) 188,775 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (10,705 ) (1,087 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (21,164 ) $ 247,088 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $198 million and $218 million during the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. This decrease in operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher inventory levels due to higher sales volumes and higher incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding decreased to 81 days at April 2, 2022 as compared to 84 days at April 3, 2021. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $19 million in the first quarter of 2022 and net cash used in investing activities totaled $159 million in the first quarter of 2021, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $28 million and $40 million in the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in 2022 also included $6 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the United States. The Company has incurred costs of $206 million on this facility through the end of the first quarter of 2022, and anticipates spending approximately $30 million to complete this new state-of-the-art facility in 2022. 32 During the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company purchased $9 million and $123 million of investments, respectively, while $54 million and $3 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. During the first of quarter 2022, the Company paid $5 million for the CDMS technology and intellectual property right asset from Megadalton, and the Company is required to make an additional $4 million of guaranteed payments at various dates in the future through 2029. The total purchase price of approximately $10 million was accounted for as Acquired In-Process Research and Development and expensed as part of costs and operating expenses in the statement of operations in the first quarter of 2022. Cash Flow from Financing Activities The Company entered into a credit agreement in September 2021 governing the Company’s five-year, $1.8 billion revolving facility that matures in September 2026. As of April 2, 2022, the Company had a total of $1.4 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $140 million borrowed under the 2021 Credit Agreement. During the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company’s net debt borrowings decreased by $70 million and increased by $350 million, respectively. As of April 2, 2022, the Company has entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value $550 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $7 million in 2022. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. During the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company repurchased $160 million and $173 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $10 million and $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. The Company received $13 million and $16 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the three months ended April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $503 million as of April 2, 2022. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $431 million held by foreign subsidiaries at April 2, 2022, of which $324 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of April 2, 2022 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2022, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. 33 The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the three months ended April 2, 2022. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the three months ended April 2, 2022.

Statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of the words “feels”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “expects”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “intends”, “suggests”, “appears”, “estimates”, “projects”, “should” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including: portions of our global workforce being unable to work fully and/or effectively due to working remotely, illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased risks of cyber attacks resulting from our temporary remote working model, disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities or to our supply chain and distribution network, volatility and uncertainty in global capital markets limiting our ability to access capital, customers being unable to make timely payment for purchases and volatility in demand for our products. • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; new or proposed tariffs or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. • The impact and costs of war, in particular as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the possibility of further escalation resulting in a new geopolitical and regulatory instability. 35 Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of April 2, 2022, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $431 million out of $503 million and $440 million out of $569 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $324 million out of $503 million and $298 million out of $569 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at April 2, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of April 2, 2022, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of April 2, 2022 would decrease by approximately $30 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the three months ended April 2, 2022. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 2, 2022 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended April 2, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 36 Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended April 2, 2022 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of April 2, 2022 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion of certain factors under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

(2) In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. The size and timing of these purchases, if any, will depend on our stock price and market and business conditions, as well as other factors. 37 Item 6: Exhibits Exhibit Number Description of Document 31.1 Chief Executive Officer Certification Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 31.2 Chief Financial Officer Certification Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 32.1 Chief Executive Officer Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s third fiscal quarters for 2021 and 2020 ended on October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 24, 2021. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption of the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could materially impact its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. 11 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $ 371 million out of $ 655 million and $ 364 million out of $ 443 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 240 million out of $ 655 million and $ 254 million out of $ 443 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Impact of CECL Adoption Additions Deductions Balance at End of Period Allowance for Credit Losses October 2, 2021 $ 14,381 $ — $ 3,388 $ ( 4,107 ) $ 13,662 September 26, 2020 $ 9,560 $ 985 $ 7,826 $ ( 5,784 ) $ 12,587 Other Investments During the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company made investments in unaffiliated companies of $ 1 million and $ 4 million, respectively. 12 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) During the nine months ended October 2, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 10 million within other income (expense) on the income statement. This unrealized gain was recorded as an upward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. During the nine months ended September 26, 2020, the Company recorded an unrealized loss on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 1 million within other income (expense) on the income statement. This unrealized loss was recorded as a downward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 13 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at October 2, 2021 (in thousands): Total at October 2, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 12,043 $ — $ 12,043 $ — Corporate debt securities 83,045 — 83,045 — Time deposits 35,803 — 35,803 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 38,587 38,587 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 93 — 93 — Total $ 169,571 $ 38,587 $ 130,984 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,307 $ — $ — $ 1,307 Foreign currency exchange contracts 375 — 375 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 12,322 — 12,322 — Total $ 14,004 $ — $ 12,697 $ 1,307 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Total at December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits $ 6,451 $ — $ 6,451 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 38,988 38,988 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 836 — 836 — Total $ 46,275 $ 38,988 $ 7,287 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,185 $ — $ — $ 1,185 Foreign currency exchange contracts 185 — 185 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 44,996 — 44,996 — Total $ 46,366 $ — $ 45,181 $ 1,185 14 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments, foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the December 2020 acquisition of Integrated Software Solutions (“ISS”) and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the achievement of certain revenue and customer account milestones over the two years after the acquisition date and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value of future contingent consideration payments related to the December 2020 acquisition of ISS was estimated to be $ 1 million at both October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s variable interest rate debt approximates fair value due to the variable nature of the interest rate. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 1.3 billion and $ 910 million at October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 1.3 billion and $ 963 million at October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. 15 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of October 2, 2021, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 340 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity (deficit) until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. 16 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): October 2, 2021 December 31, 2020 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 19,000 $ 93 $ 66,690 $ 836 Other current liabilities $ 46,772 $ 375 $ 20,000 $ 185 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other liabilities $ 340,000 $ 12,322 $ 560,000 $ 44,996 Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 20,219 $ 44,996 The following is a summary of the activity included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized (losses) gains on closed contracts Cost of sales $ ( 774 ) $ 1,113 $ 681 $ ( 45 ) Unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts Cost of sales ( 933 ) 808 ( 2,256 ) 1,455 Cumulative net pre-tax (losses) gains Cost of sales $ ( 1,707 ) $ 1,921 $ ( 1,575 ) $ 1,410 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 2,305 $ 3,777 $ 9,505 $ 11,275 Unrealized gains on open contracts Other comprehensive income $ 7,762 $ 19,582 $ 24,777 $ 19,675 Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period.

These transactions were settled in January 2020. The Company did no t have any unsettled treasury stock purchases as of December 31, 2020 or October 2, 2021. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals for Warranties Settlements Made Balance at End of Period Accrued warranty liability: October 2, 2021 $ 10,950 $ 6,537 $ ( 6,991 ) $ 10,496 September 26, 2020 $ 11,964 $ 5,442 $ ( 7,145 ) $ 10,261 Restructuring In January 2020, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 3 % of the Company’s employees. During the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020, the Company incurred $ 6 million and $ 27 million of severance-related costs, lease termination costs and other related costs. Restructuring charges incurred during the three and nine months ended October 2, 2021 were immaterial. Other Items During the nine months ended October 2, 2021, the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve patent infringement litigation with Bruker Corporation and Bruker Daltronik GmbH regarding their timsTOF product line.

The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets decreased by $ 36 million and $ 27 million, respectively, in the nine months ended October 2, 2021 due to the effects of foreign 20 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 15 million for both the three months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 45 million and $ 42 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 62 million per year for each of the next five years. 6 Debt On September 17, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), which amended the Company’s existing credit agreement entered into in 2017 (the “2017 Credit Agreement”). The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for a $ 1.8 billion revolving facility (the “2021 Credit Facility”) and converted the $ 300 million term loan under the 2017 Credit Agreement into part of the new revolving facility. As of October 2, 2021, the 2021 Credit Facility had a total of $ 310 million outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, the revolving credit facility and the term loan governed by the 2017 Credit Agreement had a total of $ 100 million and $ 300 million, respectively, outstanding. The 2021 Credit Facility matures on September 17, 2026 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2021 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2021 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2021 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2021 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. In March 2021, the Company issued the following senior unsecured notes: Senior Unsecured Notes Term Interest Rate Face Value (in millions) Maturity Date Series N 5 years 1.68 % $ 100 March 2026 Series O 10 years 2.25 % $ 400 March 2031 The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Series N and O Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. The Company may prepay some or all of the Senior Notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount for Series N and O Senior Notes, in each case, upon no more than 60 nor less than 20 days’ written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement) of the Company, the Company may be required to prepay the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Other provisions for these senior unsecured notes are similar to the existing senior unsecured notes, as described below. 21 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) As of October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had a total of $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50 :1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50 :1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. The Company had the following outstanding debt at October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands): October 2, 2021 December 31, 2020 Senior unsecured notes—Series E— 3.97 %, due March 2021 — 50,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series F— 3.40 %, due June 2021 — 100,000 Total notes payable and debt, current — 150,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series G— 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series H—floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series I — 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series K— 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series L— 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series M— 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series N— 1.68 %, due March 2026 100,000 — Senior unsecured notes—Series O— 2.25 %, due March 2031 400,000 — Credit agreement 310,000 400,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 6,382 ) ( 3,485 ) Total long-term debt 1,613,618 1,206,515 Total debt $ 1,613,618 $ 1,356,515 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2021 or 2017 Credit Agreement of $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.4 billion, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 2.67 % and 2.92 % at October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of October 2, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 122 million and $ 109 million at October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of October 2, 2021 or December 31, 2020. 22 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) As of October 2, 2021, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 340 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of October 2, 2021. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 % on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 by $ 13 million and $ 12 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.20 for both periods. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 11.8 % and 15.7 %, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the impact of quarter-specific adjustments and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 14.0 % and 14.3 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 includes a $ 6 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points for the nine months ended October 2, 2021. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 includes a $ 6 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges and a $ 3 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, for the nine months ended September 26, 2020. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in thousands): October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 28,666 $ 27,790 Net reductions for settlement of tax audits ( 878 ) — Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period ( 292 ) ( 427 ) Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period 966 907 Balance at the end of the period $ 28,462 $ 28,270 With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2015. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of October 2, 2021, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of $ 18 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various stockholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of October 2, 2021, the 2020 Plan had 6.7 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of October 2, 2021, the Company had stock options, restricted stock, and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding under the 2020 Plan. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the ​​​​​​​ 24 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. ​​​​​​​ The consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Cost of sales $ 468 $ 645 $ 1,828 $ 1,850 Selling and administrative expenses 4,116 7,747 15,810 22,472 Research and development expenses 1,769 1,201 4,311 3,393 Total stock-based compensation $ 6,353 $ 9,593 $ 21,949 $ 27,715 Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 are as follows: Nine Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Options issued in thousands 160 267 Risk-free interest rate 0.8 % 1.2 % Expected life in years 6 6 Expected volatility 32.4 % 27.8 % Expected dividends — — Nine Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Exercise price $ 281.23 $ 215.12 Fair value $ 91.46 $ 62.93 25 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2020 1,067 $ 75.94 to $ 238.52 $ 179.59 Granted 160 $ 250.15 to $ 371.64 $ 281.23 Exercised ( 275 ) $ 99.22 to $ 238.52 $ 167.89 Canceled ( 251 ) $ 139.51 to $ 280.80 $ 197.05 Outstanding at October 2, 2021 701 $ 75.94 to $ 371.64 $ 200.84 Restricted Stock During the nine months ended October 2, 2021, the Company granted four thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 254.51 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2020 271 $ 202.00 Granted 88 $ 283.10 Vested ( 86 ) $ 183.94 Forfeited ( 22 ) $ 221.64 Unvested at October 2, 2021 251 $ 234.90 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants made in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied 26 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 are as follows: Nine Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 41 58 Risk-free interest rate 0.2 % 1.3 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.9 Expected volatility 38.7 % 25.1 % Average volatility of peer companies 34.7 % 26.1 % Correlation coefficient 45.8 % 36.6 % Expected dividends — — The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the nine months ended October 2, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2020 95 $ 230.36 Granted 41 $ 315.98 Vested ( 5 ) $ 242.94 Forfeited ( 44 ) $ 199.22 Unvested at October 2, 2021 87 $ 285.73 9 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended October 2, 2021 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 161,185 61,359 $ 2.63 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 529 ( 0.03 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 161,185 61,888 $ 2.60 27 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Three Months Ended September 26, 2020 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 126,769 62,002 $ 2.04 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 301 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 126,769 62,303 $ 2.03 Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 476,604 61,771 $ 7.72 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 473 ( 0.06 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 476,604 62,244 $ 7.66 Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 303,260 62,057 $ 4.89 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 314 ( 0.03 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 303,260 62,371 $ 4.86 For the three and nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had fewer than one million stock options that were antidilutive due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the applicable period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 10 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are detailed as follows (in thousands): Currency Translation Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Retirement Plans Unrealized Gain on Investments Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance at December 31, 2020 $ ( 98,082 ) $ ( 19,861 ) $ — $ ( 117,943 ) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax 1,256 1,071 2 2,329 Balance at October 2, 2021 $ ( 96,826 ) $ ( 18,790 ) $ 2 $ ( 115,614 ) 28 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 11 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . 29 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.

The amendment also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance related to aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2020, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting guidance for equity method investments, joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The update clarifies the interaction between different sections of the accounting guidance that could be applicable and helps clarify which guidance should be applied in certain situations which should increase relevance and comparability of financial statement information. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, accounting guidance was issued that facilitates the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that 32 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January of 2021, an update was issued to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions under the reference rate reform guidance for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in the reference rate reform guidance, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company is still evaluating the impact of reference rate reform and whether this guidance will be adopted. 33 Table of Contents Item 2: Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. COVID-19 Pandemic Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that has led to volatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of the emergence of variants of the virus, or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted the Company’s manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom it outsources certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where its inventory is managed, or the operations of its logistics and other service providers. The Company also did not see material disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of its products. However, the current logistic and supply chain issues being experienced throughout the world have made it more difficult for us to manage our operations and as such we cannot provide any assurances that any further disruptions in the logistics and supply chains will not have a material impact on our future financial results and cashflows. The Company has taken decisive and appropriate actions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and continues to take proactive measures to guard the health of its global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions. The Company has implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of its locations that are operational around the world and continues to closely monitor and update its multi-phase process for the safe return of employees to their physical workplaces as social distancing, governmental requirements, including capacity limitations, and other protocols allow. The vast majority of the markets the Company serves, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, materials sciences, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and the Company is working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation. 34 Table of Contents The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be fluid with uncertainties and risks across the global economy. During 2020, the Company took a proactive approach managing through this unpredictability and implemented a series of cost reduction actions, which included temporary salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending and other working capital reductions in order to preserve liquidity and enhance financial flexibility. These cost reductions were completed by the end of 2020; however, the Company’s plan will be adjusted accordingly depending on the pace of the recovery and any further governmental restrictions that may be implemented. The 2020 cost actions reduced the Company’s spending by approximately $100 million with 79% of these savings being realized by the end of the third quarter of 2020 and approximately 21% of the savings being realized in the fourth quarter of 2020. The majority of these cost saving actions were reinstated at the beginning of 2021 and as a result, the Company expects a significant increase in its expenses and a negative impact on its cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2021 from a normalization of these costs. Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 % change October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 419,133 $ 376,239 11 % $ 1,242,110 $ 965,342 29 % Service sales 240,100 217,545 10 % 707,315 613,365 15 % Total net sales 659,233 593,784 11 % 1,949,425 1,578,707 23 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 271,128 262,342 3 % 805,529 686,120 17 % Selling and administrative expenses 152,545 135,430 13 % 453,954 400,614 13 % Research and development expenses 41,986 34,971 20 % 125,027 101,115 24 % Purchased intangibles amortization 1,759 2,657 (34 %) 5,408 7,900 (32 %) Litigation provision — — — — 1,180 (100 %) Operating income 191,815 158,384 21 % 559,507 381,778 47 % Operating income as a % of sales 29.1 % 26.7 % 28.7 % 24.2 % Other expense (607 ) (1,039 ) (42 %) 18,073 (2,149 ) * * Interest expense, net (8,533 ) (6,908 ) 24 % (23,707 ) (25,966 ) (9 %) Income before income taxes 182,675 150,437 21 % 553,873 353,663 57 % Provision for income taxes 21,490 23,668 (9 %) 77,269 50,403 53 % Net income $ 161,185 $ 126,769 27 % $ 476,604 $ 303,260 57 % Net income per diluted common share $ 2.60 $ 2.03 28 % $ 7.66 $ 4.86 58 % ** Percentage not meaningful The Company’s net sales increased 11% and 23% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2020. The sales growth in the 2021 periods was driven by strong sales growth across most major geographies, end markets, and product categories. Overall, sales benefited 35 Table of Contents from stronger demand for our products and services across all major geographies as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations except in China, where the Company’s sales were flat due to third-party shipping logistic execution issues and in Japan. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on total sales in the third quarter and increased sales by 2% in the first nine months of 2021. In addition, the Company’s first nine months of 2021 included five more calendar days than the first nine months of 2020. Instrument system sales increased 10% and 31% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, due to customer demand continuing to increase to pre-pandemic levels as customer laboratories and manufacturing facilities continued to return to normal operations. This strength in the first nine months was broad-based, particularly in LC, LC-MS and TA instrument system sales. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on instrument system sales in the third quarter and increased sales by 2% in the first nine months of 2021. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 11% and 18% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, with foreign currency translation being neutral in the quarter and increasing sales by 3% in the first nine months of the year. In the first nine months of 2021, recurring revenues benefited from five additional calendar days as compared to the first nine months of 2020. Geographically, the Company’s sales growth in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 was broad-based. During the third quarter of 2021, sales increased 8% in Asia, 16% in the Americas, and 10% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales in Europe by 2%. During the first nine months of 2021, sales increased 25% in Asia, 20% in the Americas, and 26% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales by 1% in both Asia and the Americas, and 7% in Europe. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, China sales were flat and increased 37%, respectively, driven by stronger demand due to customers resuming laboratory and manufacturing operations as well as the pent-up demand caused by the 20% decline in China’s sales in the first nine months of 2020 when the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns was occurring. China’s sales growth in the third quarter was negatively impacted by the third-party shipping logistic issues in China that resulted in flat sales growth. Foreign currency translation increased China sales growth by 3% and 5% in the quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. Sales increased 13% in the U.S. and 32% in India, while sales decreased by 1% in Japan in the quarter. Foreign currency translation decreased sales growth by 10% in India and 4% in Japan in the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 16%, driven by growth in all regions, including 14% in China, 41% in India, 16% in the Americas and 10% in Europe as strong customer demand continued to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on pharmaceutical sales growth in the quarter. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 9%, with the effect of foreign currency translation having minimal impact on sales growth in the quarter. During the third quarter of 2021, combined sales to academic and government customers decreased 9%, with foreign currency translation increasing academic and government sales by 2%. Sales to our academic customers declined 15% while sales to our government customers increased by 1%. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. During the first nine months of 2021, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 27%, driven by growth in all regions as strong customer demand continued to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Foreign currency translation increased pharmaceutical sales growth by 3%. Combined sales to industrial customers increased 23%, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales growth by 4%. During the first nine months of 2021, combined sales to academic and government customers increased 8%, as customers ramped up their spending in the first nine months of the year following lower spending levels throughout 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation increased academic and government sales growth by 2%. Operating income increased 21% and 47% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. These increases were primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes caused by our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations throughout the world. Both the quarter and year-to-date operating income increases were partially offset by the restoration of expenses that had been decreased in the 2020 periods which consisted of a series of cost reduction actions that included salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending that increased operating income by approximately $81 million in 2020. In addition, operating income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 also included $6 million and $27 million, respectively, of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination costs. 36 Table of Contents The Company generated $529 million and $523 million of net cash flows from operations in the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes being offset by the $81 million benefit from the reduction in expenses from the COVID-19 pandemic cost actions implemented and working capital improvement during the first nine months of 2020. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $117 million and $125 million in the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in the first nine months of 2021 and 2020 also included $40 million and $50 million, respectively, of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $191 million on this facility through the end of the first nine months of 2021 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. On September 17, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), which amended the Company’s existing credit agreement entered into in 2017 (the “2017 Credit Agreement”). The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion revolving facility (the “2021 Credit Facility”) and converted the $300 million term loan under the 2017 Credit Agreement into part of the new revolving facility. As of October 2, 2021, the 2021 Credit Facility had a total of $310 million outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, the revolving credit facility and the term loan governed by the 2017 Credit Agreement had a total of $100 million and $300 million, respectively, outstanding. The 2021 Credit Facility matures on September 17, 2026 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. In March 2021, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Series N $100 million notes have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate of 1.68%. The Series O $400 million notes have a 10-year term and a fixed interest rate of 2.25%.

The sales strength was broad-based, driven by continued growth in recurring revenues and the strong sales growth in instruments, particularly in LC instrument system sales. Recurring revenues sales growth was favorably impacted by the five additional calendar days in the first nine months of 2021 as compared to the first nine months of 2020. 37 Table of Contents Sales by Trade Class Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 % change October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 % change Pharmaceutical $ 398,338 $ 343,001 16 % $ 1,175,191 $ 926,582 27 % Industrial 196,032 179,128 9 % 581,884 474,592 23 % Academic and government 64,863 71,655 (9 %) 192,350 177,533 8 % Total net sales $ 659,233 $ 593,784 11 % $ 1,949,425 $ 1,578,707 23 % In the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, the increase in sales to pharmaceutical customers was broad-based with double-digit sales growth across all major geographies, primarily due to stronger demand for our products and services as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations. Sales also benefited from the demand from certain pharmaceutical customers involved with COVID-19 diagnostic testing and the increase in the development of new drugs and therapies. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales to pharmaceutical customers in the third quarter and increased sales by 3% in the first nine months of 2021. Sales to industrial customers increased 9% and 23% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, primarily due to customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations during the year. Foreign currency translation increased sales to industrial customers by 4% in the first nine months of 2021. Sales to academic and government customers decreased 9% in the third quarter and increased 8% in the first nine months of 2021, with foreign currency translation increasing sales by 2% in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2021. Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended October 2, 2021 % of Total September 26, 2020 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 240,475 41 % $ 225,790 42 % 7 % Chemistry consumables 123,045 21 % 108,175 21 % 14 % Total Waters product sales 363,520 62 % 333,965 63 % 9 % Waters service 218,291 38 % 199,501 37 % 9 % Total Waters net sales $ 581,811 100 % $ 533,466 100 % 9 % 38 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 % of Total September 26, 2020 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 717,910 41 % $ 550,018 39 % 31 % Chemistry consumables 368,478 22 % 300,525 21 % 23 % Total Waters product sales 1,086,388 63 % 850,543 60 % 28 % Waters service 644,625 37 % 562,843 40 % 15 % Total Waters net sales $ 1,731,013 100 % $ 1,413,386 100 % 22 % Waters products and service sales increased 9% and 22% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing Waters sales by 2% in the first nine months of 2021. Chemistry consumables sales increased double-digits in both the quarter and first nine months of the year due to the strong demand in the U.S., Europe, China, and India driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers. Waters service sales increased due to higher service demand billings as COVID-19 business closures and restrictions began to ease. Waters recurring revenues also benefited by five additional calendar days in the first nine months of the year. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) increased in the quarter across most major geographical regions, primarily due to higher sales as a result of stronger demand for our products and services as our customers continued to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations throughout the world. In the third quarter of 2021, Waters sales growth increased 7% in Europe, 15% in the Americas and 6% in Asia, with sales in China decreasing 1% as a result of third-party shipping logistic execution issues. Foreign currency translation increased Waters sales by 1% in both Europe and the Americas, and 3% in China. TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended October 2, 2021 % of Total September 26, 2020 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 55,613 72 % $ 42,274 70 % 32 % TA service 21,809 28 % 18,044 30 % 21 % Total TA net sales $ 77,422 100 % $ 60,318 100 % 28 % Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 % of Total September 26, 2020 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 155,722 71 % $ 114,799 69 % 36 % TA service 62,690 29 % 50,522 31 % 24 % Total TA net sales $ 218,412 100 % $ 165,321 100 % 32 % TA instrument system and service sales growth in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 was broad-based across all major geographies increasing 28% and 32%, respectively, and was primarily driven by stronger demand as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations. 39 Table of Contents In the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, the increase in TA instrument system sales was primarily driven by strength in all major regions and the increase in TA service sales was mostly due to customers continuing to resume their operations after the restrictions caused by COVID-19 during 2020, as well as sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation increased TA’s sales by 1% and 3% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 increased 3% and 17%, respectively, primarily due to the increase in sales volumes during the year, as well as the restoration in 2021 of expenses that had been reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that consisted of salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to decrease gross profit slightly for the remainder of 2021. To date, the Company has not had significant issues with its supply chain; however, the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on businesses could negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to deliver goods to us, as well as possibly increase the cost of those goods used in our manufacturing operations. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 13% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2021. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in these periods can be attributed to the salary merit and incentive compensation increases compared to 2020, which was impacted by the reduction in expenses from salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending of $16 million and $54 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. The third quarter and first nine months of 2020 also included severance and lease termination and exit costs of $6 million and $27 million, respectively. Severance and lease termination and exit costs incurred during the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 were immaterial. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation increased selling and administrative expenses by 1% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 23.1% and 23.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, and 22.8% and 25.4% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 20% and 24% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. The increase in expense in these periods was impacted by the reduction in expenses from salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending of $5 million and $14 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased expenses by 1% in the third quarter of 2021 and was neutral in the first nine months of 2021. Other Income (Expense), net In the second quarter and for the first nine months of 2021, the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve patent infringement litigation with Bruker Corporation and Bruker Daltronik GmbH regarding their timsTOF product line. In connection with the settlement, the Company is entitled to receive $10 million in guaranteed payments, including minimum royalty payments, which were recognized within other income in our consolidated statement of operations. In the first quarter and first nine months of 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense in the third quarter of 2021 increased as compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash and investments. Net interest expense for the first nine months of 2021 decreased compared to the first nine months of 2020, primarily due to lower interest expense on lower average debt balances, offset by lower interest income on cash and investments. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of October 2, 2021. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the first nine months of 2021 and 2020 by $13 million and $12 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.20 for both periods. The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020 was 11.8% and 15.7%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to the impact of quarter-specific adjustments and differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2021 and 2020 was 14.0% and 14.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of October 2, 2021 includes a $6 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points for the first nine months of October 2, 2021. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of September 26, 2020 includes a $6 million income 41 Table of Contents tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges and a $3 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, for the first nine months of September 26, 2020. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Net income $ 476,604 $ 303,260 Depreciation and amortization 97,926 91,091 Stock-based compensation 21,949 27,715 Deferred income taxes 9,219 1,089 Change in accounts receivable 23,472 96,955 Change in inventories (93,878 ) (8,139 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (4,768 ) 46,721 Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 71,889 32,053 Other changes (73,077 ) (67,720 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 529,336 523,025 Net cash used in investing activities (248,428 ) (226,561 ) Net cash used in financing activities (183,907 ) (267,968 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (8,994 ) 10,723 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 88,007 $ 39,219 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $529 million and $523 million during the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher sales volumes in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the first nine months of 2020. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding decreased to 71 days at October 2, 2021 as compared to 76 days at September 26, 2020. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. The Company also paid $38 million of tax payments in the first nine months of 2021 and 2020 associated with 2017 tax reform. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $248 million and $227 million in the first nine months of October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $117 million and $125 million in the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities On September 17, 2021, the Company amended the existing credit agreement from November 2017, providing for a 5-year $1.8 billion revolving facility, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility. All commitments under the amended agreement mature on September 17, 2026. In March 2021, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Series N $100 million notes have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate of 1.68%.

In 2018 and 2019, the Company entered into a total of $560 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. During the first nine months of 2021, $220 million of the Company’s interest rate cross-currency swaps had matured and resulted in total payments of $5 million upon settlement. As of October 2, 2021, the Company had a total of $340 million of interest rate cross-currency swaps agreements outstanding. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the nine months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company repurchased $484 million and $167 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs.

The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $371 million held by foreign subsidiaries at October 2, 2021, of which $240 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 2, 2021 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, with the exception of the recently issued senior unsecured notes as described in Note 6, “Debt.” From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2021, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with 45 Table of Contents unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions.

These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including: portions of our global workforce being unable to work fully and/or effectively due to working remotely, illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased risks of cyber attacks resulting from our temporary remote working model, disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities or to our supply chain and distribution network, volatility and uncertainty in global capital markets limiting our ability to access capital, customers being unable to make timely payment for purchases and volatility in demand for our products. • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; new or proposed tariffs or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and 47 Table of Contents competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of October 2, 2021, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $371 million out of $655 million and $364 million out of $443 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $240 million out of $655 million and $254 million out of $443 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at October 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of October 2, 2021, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. 48 Table of Contents Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of October 2, 2021 would decrease by approximately $25 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the nine months ended October 2, 2021. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 2, 2021 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended October 2, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended October 2, 2021 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. 49 Table of Contents Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of October 2, 2021 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion of certain factors under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

(2) In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. The size and timing of these purchases, if any, will depend on price, market and business conditions and other factors. 50 Table of Contents Item 6: Exhibits Exhibit Number Description of Document 10.1 Amendment and Restatement Agreement, dated as of September 17, 2021, by and among the Company, Waters Technologies Corporation, TA Instruments—Waters L.L.C., Waters Asia Limited, Environmental Resource Associates, Inc., the lenders party thereto, the issuing banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s second fiscal quarters for 2021 and 2020 ended on July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 24, 2021. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption of the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could materially impact its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $ 353 million out of $ 664 million and $ 364 million out of $ 443 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 267 million out of $ 664 million and $ 254 million out of $ 443 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Impact of CECL Adoption Additions Deductions Balance at End of Period Allowance for Credit Losses July 3, 2021 $ 14,381 $ — $ 3,042 $ ( 2,625 ) $ 14,798 June 27, 2020 $ 9,560 $ 985 $ 6,664 $ ( 3,901 ) $ 13,308 11 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Other Investments During the six months ended June 27, 2020, the Company made investments in unaffiliated companies of $ 3 million. During the six months ended July 3, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 10 million within other income (expense) on the income statement. This unrealized gain was recorded as an upward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. During the three and six months ended June 27, 2020, the Company recorded an unrealized loss on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 1 million within other income (expense) on the income statement. This unrealized loss was recorded as a downward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 12 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at July 3, 2021 (in thousands): Total at July 3, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 12,051 $ — $ 12,051 $ — Corporate debt securities 130,231 — 130,231 — Time deposits 75,897 — 75,897 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 40,965 40,965 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 223 — 223 — Total $ 259,367 $ 40,965 $ 218,402 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,266 $ — $ — $ 1,266 Foreign currency exchange contracts 142 — 142 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 22,457 — 22,457 — Total $ 23,865 $ — $ 22,599 $ 1,266 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Total at December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits $ 6,451 $ — $ 6,451 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 38,988 38,988 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 836 — 836 — Total $ 46,275 $ 38,988 $ 7,287 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,185 $ — $ — $ 1,185 Foreign currency exchange contracts 185 — 185 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 44,996 — 44,996 — Total $ 46,366 $ — $ 45,181 $ 1,185 13 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the December 2020 acquisition of Integrated Software Solutions (“ISS”) and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value of future contingent consideration payments related to the December 2020 acquisition of ISS was estimated to be $ 1 million at both July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The fair value is based on the achievement of certain revenue and customer account milestones over the two years after the acquisition date. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 1.3 billion and $ 910 million at July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.0 billion at July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. 14 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of July 3, 2021, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 490 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity (deficit) until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): July 3, 2021 December 31, 2020 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 21,000 $ 223 $ 66,690 $ 836 Other current liabilities $ 40,030 $ 142 $ 20,000 $ 185 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other liabilities $ 490,000 $ ( 22,457 ) $ 560,000 $ ( 44,996 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 27,981 $ 44,996 The following is a summary of the activity included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized (losses) gains on closed contracts Cost of sales $ ( 213 ) $ 1,823 $ 1,455 $ ( 1,157 ) Unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts Cost of sales ( 569 ) ( 678 ) ( 1,323 ) 646 Cumulative net pre-tax (losses) gains Cost of sales $ ( 782 ) $ 1,145 $ 132 $ ( 511 ) Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 3,373 $ 3,784 $ 7,200 $ 7,498 Unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts Stockholders’ equity (deficit) $ ( 4,229 ) $ ( 5,615 ) $ 17,015 $ ( 93 ) 15 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, the Company repurchased 1.2 million and 0.8 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 339 million and $ 167 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 8 million and $ 9 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. As of July 3, 2021, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 12.3 million shares at a cost of $ 2.8 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 1.2 billion authorized for future repurchases. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. The Company had $ 5 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at July 3, 2021. These transactions were settled in July 2021, during the Company’s third quarter. The Company had $ 20 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at December 31, 2019. These transactions were settled in January 2020. The Company did no t have any unsettled treasury stock purchases as of December 31, 2020 or June 27, 2020. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals for Warranties Settlements Made Balance at End of Period Accrued warranty liability: July 3, 2021 $ 10,950 $ 4,719 $ ( 4,859 ) $ 10,810 June 27, 2020 $ 11,964 $ 3,577 $ ( 5,428 ) $ 10,113 Restructuring In January 2020, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 3 % of the Company’s employees.

Interest on the Series N and O Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. The Company may prepay some or all of the Senior Notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount for Series N and O Senior Notes, in each case, upon no more than 60 nor less than 20 days’ written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement) of the Company, the Company may be required to prepay the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Other provisions for these senior unsecured notes are similar to the existing senior unsecured notes, as described below. In November 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $ 1.5 billion revolving facility and a $ 300 million term loan. As of July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the revolving facility and term loan had a total of $ 300 million and $ 400 million, respectively, outstanding and mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had a total of $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50 :1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50 :1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. 19 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STAEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had the following outstanding debt at July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands): July 3, 2021 December 31, 2020 Senior unsecured notes—Series E— 3.97 %, due March 2021 — 50,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series F— 3.40 %, due June 2021 — 100,000 Total notes payable and debt, current — 150,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series G— 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series H—floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series I— 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series K— 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series L— 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series M— 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Senior unsecured notes—Series N— 1.68 %, due March 2026 100,000 — Senior unsecured notes—Series O— 2.25 %, due March 2031 400,000 — Credit agreement 300,000 400,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 6,633 ) ( 3,485 ) Total long-term debt 1,603,367 1,206,515 Total debt $ 1,603,367 $ 1,356,515 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.4 billion, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 2.71 % and 2.92 % at July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of July 3, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 122 million and $ 109 million at July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of July 3, 2021 or December 31, 2020. As of July 3, 2021, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 490 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of July 3, 2021. The Company ha d a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 % on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 by $ 9 million and $ 7 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.14 and $ 0.11 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 was 15.3 % and 15.4 %, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 20 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STAEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 was 15.0 % and 13.2 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended July 3, 2021 includes a $ 4 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points for the six months ended July 3, 2021. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 27, 2020 includes a $ 5 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges and a $ 2 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points and 1.2 percentage points, respectively, for the six months ended June 27, 2020. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in thousands): July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 28,666 $ 27,790 Net reductions for settlement of tax audits ( 593 ) — Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period ( 198 ) ( 252 ) Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period 653 536 Balance at the end of the period $ 28,528 $ 28,074 With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2015. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of July 3, 2021, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of less than $ 1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various stockholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of July 3, 2021, the 2020 Plan had 6.6 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of July 3, 2021, the Company had stock options, restricted stock, and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding under the 2020 Plan. 21 Table of Contents The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Cost of sales $ 727 $ 635 $ 1,360 $ 1,205 Selling and administrative expenses 5,274 7,352 11,694 14,725 Research and development expenses 1,290 939 2,542 2,192 Total stock-based compensation $ 7,291 $ 8,926 $ 15,596 $ 18,122 Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 are as follows: Six Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Options issued in thousands 159 227 Risk-free interest rate 0.8 % 1.4 % Expected life in years 6 6 Expected volatility 32.5 % 26.5 % Expected dividends — — Six Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Exercise price $ 280.92 $ 216.08 Fair value $ 91.42 $ 61.70 22 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STAEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the six months ended July 3, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2020 1,067 $ 75.94 to $ 238.52 $ 179.59 Granted 159 $ 250.15 to $ 346.56 $ 280.92 Exercised ( 230 ) $ 99.22 to $ 238.52 $ 168.39 Canceled ( 228 ) $ 139.51 to $ 224.37 $ 194.59 Outstanding at July 3, 2021 768 $ 75.94 to $ 346.56 $ 199.21 Restricted Stock During the six months ended July 3, 2021, the Company granted four thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 250.15 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the six months ended July 3, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2020 271 $ 202.00 Granted 88 $ 282.94 Vested ( 81 ) $ 182.26 Forfeited ( 14 ) $ 220.23 Unvested at July 3, 2021 264 $ 234.07 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants made in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 are as follows: 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STAEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Six Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 41 58 Risk-free interest rate 0.2 % 1.3 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.9 Expected volatility 38.7 % 25.1 % Average volatility of peer companies 34.7 % 26.1 % Correlation coefficient 45.8 % 36.6 % Expected dividends — — The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the six months ended July 3, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2020 95 $ 230.36 Granted 41 $ 315.98 Vested ( 5 ) $ 242.94 Forfeited ( 39 ) $ 229.78 Unvested at July 3, 2021 92 $ 268.08 9 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended July 3, 2021 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 167,292 61,685 $ 2.71 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 472 ( 0.02 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 167,292 62,157 $ 2.69 Three Months Ended June 27, 2020 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 122,929 61,944 $ 1.98 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 240 — Net income per diluted common share $ 122,929 62,184 $ 1.98 24 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 315,419 61,979 $ 5.09 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 456 ( 0.04 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 315,419 62,435 $ 5.05 Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 176,491 62,085 $ 2.84 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 319 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 176,491 62,404 $ 2.83 For the three and six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, the Company had fewer than one million stock options that were antidilutive due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the applicable period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 10 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are detailed as follows (in thousands): Currency Translation Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Retirement Plans Unrealized Loss on Investments Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance at December 31, 2020 $ ( 98,082 ) $ ( 19,861 ) $ — $ ( 117,943 ) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax 5,816 963 ( 15 ) 6,764 Balance at July 3, 2021 $ ( 92,266 ) $ ( 18,898 ) $ ( 15 ) $ ( 111,179 ) 25 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 11 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. 26 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as follows for the three and six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Product net sales: Waters instrument systems $ 261,363 $ 181,399 $ 477,435 $ 324,228 Chemistry consumables 126,459 95,105 245,433 192,350 TA instrument systems 53,133 38,416 100,109 72,525 Total product sales 440,955 314,920 822,977 589,103 Service net sales: Waters service 219,502 189,205 426,334 363,342 TA service 21,190 15,859 40,881 32,478 Total service sales 240,692 205,064 467,215 395,820 Total net sales $ 681,647 $ 519,984 $ 1,290,192 $ 984,923 Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

Prior guidance required the recognition of a credit loss when it was considered probable that a loss event had occurred. The current guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and non-credit components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted this new standard using a modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost which only impacted the Company’s allowance on trade accounts receivable. The Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet credit exposures which would be impacted by the new guidance. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under the new standard while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a net decrease of $ 1 million to stockholders’ deficit as of January 1, 2020 for the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard due to converting to the current expected credit loss model for the allowance recorded against trade accounts receivables. This accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer 28 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant.

In December 2019, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions within the current guidance, including the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendment also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance related to aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2020, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting guidance for equity method investments, joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The update clarifies the interaction between different sections of the accounting guidance that could be applicable and helps clarify which guidance should be applied in certain situations which should increase relevance and comparability of financial statement information. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, accounting guidance was issued that facilitates the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January of 2021, an update was issued to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions under the reference rate reform guidance for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in the reference rate reform guidance, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company is still evaluating the impact of reference rate reform and whether this guidance will be adopted. 29 Table of Contents Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. COVID-19 Pandemic Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that has led to volatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect of the emergence of variants of the virus, or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. During the six months ended July 3, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially impact the Company’s manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom it outsources certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where its inventory is managed, or the operations of its logistics and other service providers. The Company also did not see material disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of its products. The Company has taken decisive and appropriate actions throughout the pandemic, and continues to take proactive measures to guard the health of its global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions. The Company has implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of its locations that are operational around the world and continues to closely monitor and update its multi-phase process for the safe return of employees to their physical workplaces as social distancing, governmental requirements, including capacity limitations, and other protocols allow. The vast majority of the markets the Company serves, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, materials sciences, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and the Company is working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be fluid with uncertainties and risks remaining across the global economy. During 2020, the Company took a proactive approach managing through this unpredictability and implemented a series of cost reduction actions, which included temporary salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending and other working capital reductions in order to preserve liquidity and enhance financial flexibility. These cost reductions were completed by the end of 2020; however, the Company’s plan will be adjusted accordingly depending on the pace of the recovery and any further governmental restrictions that may be implemented. The 2020 cost actions reduced the Company’s spending by approximately $100 million with 58% of these savings being realized by the end of the second quarter of 2020 and approximately 21% of the savings being realized in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020. The majority of these cost saving actions were reinstated at the beginning of 2021 and as a result, the Company expects a significant increase in its expenses and a negative impact on its cash flows during the second half of 2021 from a normalization of these costs. 30 Table of Contents Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 % change July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 440,955 $ 314,920 40 % $ 822,977 $ 589,103 40 % Service sales 240,692 205,064 17 % 467,215 395,820 18 % Total net sales 681,647 519,984 31 % 1,290,192 984,923 31 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 280,254 213,134 31 % 534,401 423,778 26 % Selling and administrative expenses 158,213 117,449 35 % 301,409 265,184 14 % Research and development expenses 44,949 31,155 44 % 83,041 66,144 26 % Purchased intangibles amortization 1,809 2,618 (31 %) 3,649 5,243 (30 %) Litigation provision — 514 (100 %) — — — Acquired in-process research and development — — — — 1,180 (100 %) Operating income 196,422 155,114 27 % 367,692 223,394 65 % Operating income as a % of sales 28.8 % 29.8 % 28.5 % 22.7 % Other income (expense) 9,321 (736 ) * * 18,680 (1,110 ) * * Interest expense, net (8,329 ) (9,015 ) (8 %) (15,174 ) (19,058 ) (20 %) Income before income taxes 197,414 145,363 36 % 371,198 203,226 83 % Provision for income taxes 30,122 22,434 34 % 55,779 26,735 109 % Net income $ 167,292 $ 122,929 36 % $ 315,419 $ 176,491 79 % Net income per diluted common share $ 2.69 $ 1.98 36 % $ 5.05 $ 2.83 78 % ** Percentage not meaningful Despite the various ongoing challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s net sales increased 31% in both the second quarter and first half of 2021 as compared to the second quarter and first half of 2020. The sales growth in the 2021 periods was driven by strong sales growth across all major geographies, end markets, and product categories. Overall, sales benefited from stronger demand for our products and services across all major geographies as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations, particularly in China where sales grew 42% and 68% in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. Foreign currency translation increased total sales by 4% in both the second quarter and first half of 2021. In addition, the Company’s first half of 2021 included five more calendar days than the first half of 2020. Instrument system sales increased 43% and 46% for the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, due to customer demand continuing to increase to pre-pandemic levels as customer laboratories and manufacturing facilities continued to return to normal operations. This strength was broad-based, particularly in LC, LC-MS and TA instrument system sales. Foreign currency translation increased instrument system sales by 3% and 4% in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 22% and 21% for the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively, with foreign currency translation increasing sales by 4% in both the quarter and first half of the year. In the first half of 2021, recurring revenues benefited from five additional calendar days as compared to the first half of 2020. Geographically, the Company’s sales growth in the second quarter and first half of 2021 was broad-based across all major regions. During the second quarter of 2021, sales increased 30% in Asia, 29% in the Americas, and 36% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales in those regions by 2%, 1%, and 11%, respectively. During the first half of 2021, sales increased 36% in Asia, 22% in the Americas, and 36% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales in those regions by 2%, 1%, and 11%, respectively. In the second quarter and first half of 2021, China sales increased 42% and 68%, respectively, driven by stronger demand due to customers resuming laboratory and manufacturing operations as well as the pent-up demand caused by the 32% decline in China’s sales in the first half of 2020 when the negative impact of the pandemic lockdowns was occurring. Foreign currency translation increased China sales growth by 5% and 6% in the quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. Sales increased 26% in the U.S., 9% in Japan and 47% in India in the quarter. Foreign currency translation decreased sales growth by 2% in Japan and 11% in India in the second quarter of 2021. 31 Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2021, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 34%, driven by growth in all regions, including 48% in China, 49% in India, and 33% in Europe as strong customer demand continued to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Foreign currency translation increased pharmaceutical sales growth by 3%. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 33%, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales growth by 5%. During the second quarter of 2021, combined sales to academic and government customers increased 10%, as customers continued to ramp up their spending in the first half of the year following lower spending levels throughout 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation increased academic and government sales growth by 3%. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. During the first half of 2021, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 33%, driven by growth in all regions as strong customer demand continued to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Foreign currency translation increased pharmaceutical sales growth by 4%. Combined sales to industrial customers increased 31%, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales growth by 5%. During the first half of 2021, combined sales to academic and government customers increased 20%, as customers ramped up their spending in the first half of the year following lower spending levels throughout 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation increased academic and government sales growth by 3%. Operating income increased 27% and 65% for the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. These increases were primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes caused by our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations throughout the world. Both the quarter and year-to-date operating income increases were partially offset by the restoration of expenses that had been decreased in the 2020 periods which consisted of a series of cost reduction actions that included salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending that increased operating income by approximately $54 million in 2020. In addition, operating income in the second quarter and first half of 2020 also included $3 million and $21 million, respectively, of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination costs. The Company generated $361 million and $350 million of net cash flows from operations in the first half of 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes being offset by the $54 million benefit from the reduction in expenses from the COVID-19 pandemic cost actions implemented and working capital improvement during the second quarter of 2020. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $77 million and $97 million in the first half of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cash flows from investing activities in the first half of 2021 also included $28 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $182 million on this facility through the end of the first half of 2021 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. In March 2021, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Series N $100 million notes have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate of 1.68%. The Series O $400 million notes have a 10-year term and a fixed interest rate of 2.25%. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the first half of 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased $339 million and $167 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three and six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 % change July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 % change Net Sales: Asia: China $ 127,225 $ 89,816 42 % $ 230,144 $ 137,047 68 % Japan 45,113 41,230 9 % 95,409 86,319 11 % Asia Other 97,609 77,163 26 % 173,936 143,923 21 % Total Asia 269,947 208,209 30 % 499,489 367,289 36 % Americas: United States 186,915 148,928 26 % 349,348 292,826 19 % Americas Other 37,979 25,854 47 % 72,903 54,132 35 % Total Americas 224,894 174,782 29 % 422,251 346,958 22 % Europe 186,806 136,993 36 % 368,452 270,676 36 % Total net sales $ 681,647 $ 519,984 31 % $ 1,290,192 $ 984,923 31 % In the second quarter and first half of 2021, sales benefited from stronger demand for our products and services across all major geographies and customer classes as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations, as well as the pent-up demand from 2020 caused by the pandemic, particularly in China, where sales grew 42% and 68%, respectively. The sales strength was broad-based, driven by continued growth in recurring revenues and the strong sales growth in instruments, particularly in LC and LC-MS instrument system sales which grew double-digits across all major geographies. Recurring revenues sales growth was favorably impacted by the five additional calendar days in the first half of 2021 as compared to the first half of 2020.

Chemistry consumables sales increased double-digits in both the quarter and first half of the year driven by the strong demand in China, where sales grew 45% year-to-date, in addition to increased demand in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and India driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers. Waters service sales increased due to higher service demand billings as COVID-19 business closures and restrictions began to ease, particularly in China and Europe. Waters recurring revenues also benefited by five additional calendar days in the first half of the year. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) increased in all major geographical regions primarily due to higher sales as a result of stronger demand for our products and services as our customers continued to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations throughout the world. In the second quarter of 2021, Waters sales growth was broad-based and increased 34% in Europe, 27% in the Americas and 30% in Asia, with sales in China growing 44%. Foreign currency translation increased Waters sales by 11% and 4% in Europe and China, respectively, and 1% in both the Americas and Asia. 34 Table of Contents TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three and six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended July 3, 2021 % of Total June 27, 2020 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 53,133 71 % $ 38,416 71 % 38 % TA service 21,190 29 % 15,859 29 % 34 % Total TA net sales $ 74,323 100 % $ 54,275 100 % 37 % Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 % of Total June 27, 2020 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 100,109 71 % $ 72,525 69 % 38 % TA service 40,881 29 % 32,478 31 % 26 % Total TA net sales $ 140,990 100 % $ 105,003 100 % 34 % TA instrument system and service sales growth in the second quarter and first half of 2021 was broad-based across all major geographies increasing 37% and 34%, respectively, and was primarily driven by stronger demand as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations. In the second quarter and first half of 2021, the increase in TA instrument system sales was primarily driven by strength in all major regions and the increase in TA service sales was mostly due to customers continuing to resume their operations after the restrictions caused by COVID-19 during 2020, as well as sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation increased TA’s sales by 5% and 4% in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the second quarter and first half of 2021 increased 31% and 26%, respectively, primarily due to the increase in sales volumes during the year, as well as the restoration in 2021 of expenses that had been reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that consisted of salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to increase gross profit slightly for the remainder of 2021. To date, the Company has not had significant issues with its supply chain; however, the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on businesses could negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to deliver goods to us, as well as possibly increase the cost of those goods used in our manufacturing operations. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 35% and 14% for the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in these periods can be attributed to the salary merit and incentive compensation increases compared to 2020 which was impacted by the $33 million reduction in expenses from salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation increased selling and administrative expenses by 3% for both the second quarter and first half of 2021. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 23.2% and 23.4% for the second quarter and first half of 2021, and 22.6% and 26.9% for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. 35 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 44% and 26% in the second quarter and first half of 2021, respectively. The increase in expense in these periods was impacted by the $9 million reduction in expenses from salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending in 2020. The impact of foreign currency exchange was neutral in the second quarter of 2021 and decreased expenses by approximately 1% in the first half of 2021. Other Income (Expense), net In the second quarter of 2021, the Company executed a settlement agreement to resolve patent infringement litigation with Bruker Corporation and Bruker Daltronik GmbH regarding their timsTOF product line. In connection with the settlement, the Company is entitled to receive $10 million in guaranteed payments, including minimum royalty payments, which were recognized within other income in our consolidated statement of operations. In the first quarter and first half of 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over. Interest Expense, Net The decrease in net interest expense in the second quarter and first half of 2021 was primarily attributable to interest earned on higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of July 3, 2021. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the first six months of 2021 and 2020 by $9 million and $7 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.14 and $0.11, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 was 15.3% and 15.4%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2021 and 2020 was 15.0% and 13.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first six months of July 3, 2021 includes a $4 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.1 percentage points for the first six months of July 3, 2021. The effective tax rate for the first six months of June 27, 2020 includes a $5 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges and a $2 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points and 1.2 percentage points, respectively, for the first six months of June 27, 2020. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 36 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Six Months Ended July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Net income $ 315,419 $ 176,491 Depreciation and amortization 64,743 60,203 Stock-based compensation 15,596 18,122 Deferred income taxes 6,107 (777 ) Change in accounts receivable 18,985 86,978 Change in inventories (50,873 ) (27,089 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (35,328 ) 34,714 Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 91,631 37,558 Other changes (64,836 ) (35,754 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 361,444 350,446 Net cash used in investing activities (281,106 ) (192,335 ) Net cash used in financing activities (48,191 ) (159,366 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (8,786 ) 4,576 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 23,361 $ 3,321 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $361 million and $350 million during the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding decreased to 73 days at July 3, 2021 as compared to 87 days at June 27, 2020. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. The Company also paid $38 million of tax payments in the first half of 2021 associated with 2017 tax reform. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $281 million and $192 million in the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $77 million and $97 million in the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash, investments and debt capacity. The Company incurred $31 million of costs associated with the construction of this facility during the six months ended July 3, 2021. The Company has incurred $182 million on this facility through the end of the second quarter of 2021. 37 Table of Contents During the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, the Company purchased $215 million and $17 million of investments, respectively, while $18 million and $2 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. In January of 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, S.A. and its two operating subsidiaries, Andrew Alliance USA, Inc. and Andrew Alliance France, SASU (collectively “Andrew Alliance”), for $80 million, net of cash acquired. The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $4 million and included as part of the total consideration. Cash Flow from Financing Activities In March 2021, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Series N $100 million notes have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate of 1.68%. The Series O $400 million notes have a 10-year term and a fixed interest rate of 2.25% The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. During the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $250 million and $15 million, respectively. As of July 3, 2021, the Company had a total of $1.6 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.3 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $300 million borrowed under a term loan under the credit agreement dated November 2017 (“2017 Credit Agreement”). As of July 3, 2021, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1.5 billion after outstanding letters of credit. As of July 3, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In 2018 and 2019, the Company entered into a total of $560 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. During the first six months of 2021, $70 million of the Company’s interest rate cross-currency swaps had matured and resulted in total payments of $4 million upon settlement. As of July 3, 2021, the Company had a total of $490 million of interest rate cross-currency swaps agreements outstanding. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, the Company repurchased $339 million and $167 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $8 million and $9 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. The Company had $5 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at July 3, 2021. These transactions were settled in July 2021, during the Company’s third quarter. The Company had $20 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at December 31, 2019. These transactions were settled in January 2020. The Company did not have any unsettled treasury stock purchases as of December 31, 2020 or June 27, 2020. The Company received $45 million and $15 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the six months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $664 million as of July 3, 2021. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $353 million held by foreign subsidiaries at July 3, 2021, of which $267 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of July 3, 2021 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, with the exception of the recently issued senior unsecured notes as described in Note 6, “Debt.” 38 Table of Contents From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2021, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the six months ended July 3, 2021. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the six months ended July 3, 2021.

Many of these statements appear, in particular, under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of the words “feels”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “expects”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “intends”, “suggests”, “appears”, “estimates”, “projects”, “should” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including: portions of our global workforce being unable to work fully and/or effectively due to working remotely, illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons related to the pandemic, increased risks of cyber attacks resulting from our temporary remote working model, disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities or to our supply chain, volatility and uncertainty in global capital markets limiting our ability to access capital, customers being unable to make timely payment for purchases and volatility in demand for our products. • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; new or proposed tariffs or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. 40 Table of Contents • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of July 3, 2021, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $353 million out of $664 million and $364 million out of $443 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $267 million out of $664 million and $254 million out of $443 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at July 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of July 3, 2021, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of July 3, 2021 would decrease by approximately $25 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the six months ended July 3, 2021. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 3, 2021 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended July 3, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 41 Table of Contents Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended July 3, 2021 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of July 3, 2021 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

Significant Accounting Policies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s first fiscal quarters for 2021 and 2020 ended on April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 24, 2021. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. Since being declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has continued to spread throughout the U.S. and globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the Company’s business and could result in a prolonged economic downturn. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 8 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption of the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could materially impact its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $ 317 million out of $ 810 million and $ 364 million out of $ 443 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 256 million out of $ 810 million and $ 254 million out of $ 443 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. 9 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Impact of CECL Adoption Additions Deductions Balance at End of Period Allowance for Credit Losses April 3, 2021 $ 14,381 $ — $ 775 $ ( 1,561 ) $ 13,595 March 28, 2020 $ 9,560 $ 985 $ 3,506 $ ( 1,749 ) $ 12,302 Other Investments During the three months ended April 3, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 10 million within other income (expense) on the income statement. This unrealized gain was recorded as an upward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at April 3, 2021 (in thousands): Total at April 3, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 12,061 $ — $ 12,061 $ — Corporate debt securities 119,800 — 119,800 — Time deposits 58,712 — 58,712 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 39,605 39,605 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 208 — 208 — Total $ 230,386 $ 39,605 $ 190,781 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,225 $ — $ — $ 1,225 Foreign currency exchange contracts 241 — 241 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 20,030 — 20,030 — Total $ 21,496 $ — $ 20,271 $ 1,225 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Total at December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits $ 6,451 $ — $ 6,451 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 38,988 38,988 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 836 — 836 — Total $ 46,275 $ 38,988 $ 7,287 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 1,185 $ — $ — $ 1,185 Foreign currency exchange contracts 185 — 185 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 44,996 — 44,996 — Total $ 46,366 $ — $ 45,181 $ 1,185 11 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the December 2020 acquisition of Integrated Software Solutions (“ISS”) and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value of future contingent consideration payments related to the December 2020 acquisition of ISS was estimated to be $ 1 million at both April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The fair value is based on the achievement of certain revenue and customer account milestones over the two years after the acquisition date. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 1.4 billion and $ 910 million at April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.0 billion at April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. 12 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of April 3, 2021, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 520 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity (deficit) until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): April 3, 2021 December 31, 2020 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 36,131 $ 208 $ 66,690 $ 836 Other current liabilities $ 25,423 $ 241 $ 20,000 $ 185 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other liabilities $ 520,000 $ ( 20,030 ) $ 560,000 $ ( 44,996 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 23,751 $ 44,996 The following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts (in thousands): Financial Three Months Ended Statement Classification April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized gains (losses) on closed contracts Cost of sales $ 1,667 $ ( 2,981 ) Unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts Cost of sales ( 753 ) 1,325 Cumulative net pre-tax gains (losses) Cost of sales $ 914 $ ( 1,656 ) Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 3,827 $ 3,714 Unrealized gains on contracts, net Stockholders’ equity (deficit) $ 21,244 $ 5,522 13 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company repurchased 0.6 million and 0.8 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 173 million and $ 167 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 8 million and $ 9 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. As of April 3, 2021, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 11.8 million shares at a cost of $ 2.6 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 1.4 billion authorized for future repurchases. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. The Company had $ 7 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at April 3, 2021. These transactions were settled in April 2021, during the Company’s second quarter. The Company had $ 20 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at December 31, 2019. These transactions were settled in January 2020. The Company did no t have any unsettled treasury stock purchases as of December 31, 2020 or March 28, 2020. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals for Warranties Settlements Made Balance at End of Period Accrued warranty liability: April 3, 2021 $ 10,950 $ 2,337 $ ( 2,582 ) $ 10,705 March 28, 2020 $ 11,964 $ 1,671 $ ( 2,619 ) $ 11,016 Restructuring In January 2020, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 3 % of the Company’s employees. During the three months ended March 28, 2020, the Company incurred $ 18 million of severance-related costs, lease termination costs and other related costs. The Company did not incur any restructuring charges during the three months ended April 3, 2021. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. 14 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in thousands): April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 239,759 $ 213,695 Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period ( 94,078 ) ( 82,604 ) Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 182,384 138,430 Balance at the end of the period $ 328,065 $ 269,521 The Company classified $ 47 million and $ 42 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 62 million per year for each of the next five years. 16 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 6 Debt In March 2021, the Company issued the following senior unsecured notes: Senior Unsecured Notes Term Interest Rate Face Value (in millions) Maturity Date Series N 5 years 1.68 % $ 100 March 2026 Series O 10 years 2.25 % $ 400 March 2031 The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Series N and O Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. The Company may prepay some or all of the Senior Notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount for Series N and O Senior Notes, in each case, upon no more than 60 nor less than 20 days’ written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement) of the Company, the Company may be required to prepay the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest . Other provisions for these senior unsecured notes are similar to the existing senior unsecured notes, as described below. In November 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $ 1.5 billion revolving facility and a $ 300 million term loan. As of April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the revolving facility and term loan had a total of $ 300 million and $ 400 million, respectively, outstanding and mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had a total of $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 % of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note . In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50 :1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50 :1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. 17 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had the following outstanding debt at April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands): April 3, 2021 December 31, 2020 Senior unsecured notes - Series E - 3.97 %, due March 2021 — 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series F - 3.40 %, due June 2021 100,000 100,000 Total notes payable and debt, current 100,000 150,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series L - 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series M - 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series N - 1.68 %, due March 2026 100,000 — Senior unsecured notes - Series O - 2.25 %, due March 2031 400,000 — Credit agreement 300,000 400,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 6,910 ) ( 3,485 ) Total long-term debt 1,603,090 1,206,515 Total debt $ 1,703,090 $ 1,356,515 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.4 billion, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 2.68 % and 2.92 % at April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of April 3, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 122 million and $ 109 million at April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of April 3, 2021 or December 31, 2020. As of April 3, 2021, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 520 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of April 3 , 2021 . The Company ha d a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021 , based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5 % on certain types of income for the period April 1 , 2021 through March 31 , 2026 . The effect of applying the 0 % concessionary income tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income arising from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the three months ended April 3 , 2021 and March 28 , 2020 by $ 4 million and $ 2 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.06 and $ 0.04 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 was 14.8 % and 7.4 %, respectively. The income tax provision includes a $ 2 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for both the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020. The effective tax rate for the three months ended 18 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) March 28, 2020 included a $ 4 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 7.1 percentage points for the three months ended March 28, 2020. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in thousands): April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 28,666 $ 27,790 Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period ( 95 ) ( 101 ) Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period 289 203 Balance at the end of the period $ 28,860 $ 27,892 With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 201 5 . The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of April 3, 2021, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of less than $ 1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various stockholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of April 3, 2021, the 2020 Plan had 6.5 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of April 3, 2021, the Company had stock options, restricted stock, and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding under the 2020 Plan. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these 19 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Cost of sales $ 633 $ 570 Selling and administrative expenses 6,420 7,373 Research and development expenses 1,252 1,253 Total stock-based compensation $ 8,305 $ 9,196 Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 are as follows: Three Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Options issued in thousands 139 227 Risk-free interest rate 0.8 % 1.4 % Expected life in years 6 6 Expected volatility 33.1 % 26.5 % Expected dividend s — — Three Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Exercise price $ 277.32 $ 216.08 Fair value $ 91.63 $ 61.70 20 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the three months ended April 3, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2020 1,067 $ 75.94 to $ 238.52 $ 179.59 Granted 139 $ 250.15 to $ 280.80 $ 277.32 Exercised ( 95 ) $ 99.22 to $ 238.52 $ 159.10 Canceled ( 125 ) $ 139.51 to $ 224.37 $ 183.98 Outstanding at April 3, 2021 986 $ 75.94 to $ 266.05 $ 194.77 Restricted Stock During the three months ended April 3, 2021, the Company granted four thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 250.15 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the three months ended April 3, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2020 271 $ 202.00 Granted 76 $ 279.66 Vested ( 80 ) $ 182.14 Forfeited ( 3 ) $ 210.35 Unvested at April 3, 2021 264 $ 230.28 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants made in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 are as follows: Three Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 41 58 Risk-free interest rate 0.2 % 1.3 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.9 Expected volatility 38.7 % 25.1 % Average volatility of peer companies 34.7 % 26.1 % Correlation coefficient 45.8 % 36.6 % Expected dividends — — 21 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the three months ended April 3, 2021 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2020 95 $ 230.36 Granted 41 $ 315.98 Vested ( 5 ) $ 242.94 Forfeited ( 33 ) $ 228.24 Unvested at April 3, 2021 98 $ 266.25 9 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 148,127 62,260 $ 2.38 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 372 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 148,127 62,632 $ 2.37 Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 53,562 62,232 $ 0.86 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 394 — Net income per diluted common share $ 53,562 62,626 $ 0.86 For the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company had 0.1 million and 0.2 million stock options that were antidilutive, respectively, due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 22 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 10 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are detailed as follows (in thousands): Currency Translation Unrealized Loss on Retirement Plans Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance at December 31, 2020 $ ( 98,082 ) $ ( 19,861 ) $ — $ ( 117,943 ) Other comprehensive loss, net of tax 5,825 922 ( 10 ) 6,737 Balance at April 3, 2021 $ ( 92,257 ) $ ( 18,939 ) $ ( 10 ) $ ( 111,206 ) 11 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as follows for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Product net sales: Waters instrument systems $ 216,072 $ 142,829 Chemistry consumables 118,974 97,245 TA instrument systems 46,976 34,109 Total product sales 382,022 274,183 Service net sales: Waters service 206,832 174,137 TA service 19,691 16,619 Total service sales 226,523 190,756 Total net sales $ 608,545 $ 464,939 Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

Prior guidance required the recognition of a credit loss when it was considered probable that a loss event had occurred. The current guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and non-credit components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted this new standard using a modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost which only impacted the Company’s allowance on trade accounts receivable. The Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet credit exposures which would be impacted by the new guidance. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under the new standard while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a net decrease of $ 1 million to stockholders’ deficit as of January 1, 2020 for the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard due to converting to the current expected credit loss model for the allowance recorded against trade accounts receivables. This accounting standard did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 25 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In December 2019, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions within the current guidance, including the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendment also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance related to aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2020, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting guidance for equity method investments, joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The update clarifies the interaction between different sections of the accounting guidance that could be applicable and helps clarify which guidance should be applied in certain situations which should increase relevance and comparability of financial statement information. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2020, accounting guidance was issued that facilitates the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January of 2021 , an update was issued to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions under the reference rate reform guidance for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in the reference rate reform guidance, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company is still evaluating the impact of reference rate reform and whether this guidance will be adopted. 14 Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated for the occurrence of subsequent events through the issuance date of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. No other recognized or non-recognized subsequent events occurred that require recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, except as noted below. The Company has executed a settlement agreement to resolve patent infringement litigation with Bruker Corporation and Bruker Daltronik GmbH regarding their timsTOF product line. In connection with that settlement, the Company will receive $ 10 million in guaranteed payments, including minimum royalty payments, which will be recognized within other income in our consolidated statement of operations in the second quarter of 2021. 26 Table of Contents Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and government customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. COVID-19 Pandemic Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic that has led to volatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. During the three months ended April 3, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially impact the Company’s manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom it outsources certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where its inventory is managed, or the operations of its logistics and other service providers. The Company also did not see material disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of its products. The Company has taken decisive and appropriate actions throughout the pandemic, and continues to take proactive measures to guard the health of its global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions. The Company has implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of its locations that are operational around the world and continues to closely monitor and update its multi-phase process for the safe return of employees to their physical workplaces as social distancing, governmental requirements, including capacity limitations, and other protocols allow. The vast majority of the markets the Company serves, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, materials sciences, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and the Company is working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be fluid with uncertainties and risks remaining across the global economy. During 2020, the Company took a proactive approach managing through this unpredictability and implemented a series of cost reduction actions, which included temporary salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending and other working capital reductions in order to preserve liquidity and enhance financial flexibility. These cost reductions were completed by the end of 2020; however, the Company’s plan will be adjusted accordingly depending on the pace of the recovery and any further governmental restrictions that may be implemented. The 2020 cost actions reduced the Company’s spending by approximately $100 million with 58% of these savings being realized by the end of the second quarter of 2020 and approximately 21% of the savings being realized in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020. The majority of these cost saving actions were reinstated at the beginning of 2021 and as a result, the Company expects a significant increase in its expenses and a negative impact on its cash flows during the last three quarters of 2021 from a normalization of these costs. 27 Table of Contents Financial Overview The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 382,022 $ 274,183 39 % Service sales 226,523 190,756 19 % Total net sales 608,545 464,939 31 % Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 254,147 210,644 21 % Selling and administrative expenses 143,196 147,735 (3 %) Research and development expenses 38,092 34,989 9 % Purchased intangibles amortization 1,840 2,625 (30 %) Litigation provision — 666 (100 %) Operating income 171,270 68,280 151 % Operating income as a % of sales 28.1 % 14.7 % Other income (expense), net 9,359 (374 ) 2,602 % Interest expense, net (6,845 ) (10,043 ) (32 %) Income before income taxes 173,784 57,863 200 % Provision for income taxes 25,657 4,301 497 % Net income $ 148,127 $ 53,562 177 % Net income per diluted common share $ 2.37 $ 0.86 176 % Despite the various ongoing challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s net sales increased 31% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 driven by strong sales growth across all major geographies, end markets, and product categories. Overall, first quarter sales benefited from stronger demand for our products and services across all major geographies as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations, particularly in China where sales grew 118%. Foreign currency translation increased total sales by 4%. In addition, the Company’s first quarter of 2021 included five more calendar days than the first quarter of 2020. Instrument system sales increased 49% in the quarter, due to customer demand continuing to increase to pre-pandemic levels as customer laboratories and manufacturing facilities returned to normal operations. This strength was broad-based, particularly in LC, LC-MS and TA instrument system sales. Foreign currency translation increased instrument system sales by 4%. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 20% in the quarter, with foreign currency translation increasing sales by 5%. In the first quarter of 2021, recurring revenues benefited from five additional calendar days as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Geographically, the Company’s sales growth was broad-based across all major regions as sales increased 44% in Asia, 15% in the Americas, and 36% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales in those regions by 3%, 1%, and 11%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, China sales increased 118%, driven by stronger demand due to customers resuming laboratory and manufacturing operations as well as the pent-up demand caused by the 48% decline in China’s sales in the first quarter of 2020 when the negative impact of the pandemic lockdowns were first experienced. Foreign currency translation increased China sales growth by 9% in the quarter. Sales increased 13% in the U.S., 12% in Japan and 13% in India. Foreign currency translation increased sales growth in Japan by 4% and decreased sales growth in India by 8% in the first quarter of 2021, respectively. During the first quarter of 2021, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 32%, driven by growth in all regions, including 127% in China, 18% in India, and 32% in Europe as strong customer demand continued to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Foreign currency translation increased pharmaceutical sales growth by 4%. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 28%, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales growth by 4%. During the first quarter of 2021, combined sales to academic and government customers increased 33%, as government customers ramped up their spending in the first quarter following lower spending levels throughout 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 28 Table of Contents Foreign currency translation increased academic and government sales growth by 4%. Sales to our academic and government customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. Operating income was $171 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 151% as compared to the first quarter of 2020. This increase in the quarter was primarily a result of the increase in sales volumes caused by our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations throughout the world. Operating income in the first quarter of 2020 included $18 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination costs. The Company generated $218 million and $152 million of net cash flows from operations in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $40 million and $51 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The first quarter of 2021 includes $14 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $166 million on this facility through the end of the first quarter of 2021 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility.

During the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased $173 million and $167 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 % change Net Sales: Asia: China $ 102,919 $ 47,231 118 % Japan 50,296 45,089 12 % Asia Other 76,327 66,760 14 % Total Asia 229,542 159,080 44 % Americas: United States 162,433 143,898 13 % Americas Other 34,924 28,278 24 % Total Americas 197,357 172,176 15 % Europe 181,646 133,683 36 % Total net sales $ 608,545 $ 464,939 31 % In the first quarter of 2021, sales benefited from stronger demand for our products and services across all major geographies and customer classes as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations, as well as the pent-up demand from 2020 caused by the pandemic, particularly in China, where sales grew 29 Table of Contents 118%. The sales strength was broad-based, driven by continued growth in recurring revenues and the strong sales growth in instruments, particularly in LC and LC-MS instrument system sales which grew double-digits across all geographies. Recurring revenues sales growth was favorably impacted by the five additional calendar days in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Sales by Trade Class Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 % change Pharmaceutical $ 360,148 $ 272,563 32 % Industrial 183,273 143,354 28 % Academic and government 65,124 49,022 33 % Total net sales $ 608,545 $ 464,939 31 % In the first quarter of 2021, the increase in sales to pharmaceutical customers was broad-based and primarily due to stronger demand for our products and services across all major geographies as a result of our customers resuming laboratory and manufacturing operations. Sales also benefited from the demand from certain pharmaceutical customers involved with COVID-19 diagnostic testing and the increase in the development of new drugs and therapies. Foreign currency translation increased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 4%. The increase in sales to industrial and academic and government customers was mostly broad-based across all product classes as customers continued to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations during the quarter. Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 % of Total March 28, 2020 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 216,072 40 % $ 142,829 34 % 51 % Chemistry consumables 118,974 22 % 97,245 24 % 22 % Total Waters product sales 335,046 62 % 240,074 58 % 40 % Waters service 206,832 38 % 174,137 42 % 19 % Total Waters net sales $ 541,878 100 % $ 414,211 100 % 31 % The effect of foreign currency translation increased Waters sales by 5% for the first quarter. Chemistry consumables sales increased in the first quarter driven by the strong demand in China, where sales grew 79%, in addition to increased demand in Europe, Japan, and India driven by the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers. Waters service sales increased due to higher service demand billings as COVID-19 business closures and lockdowns began to ease, particularly in China and Europe. Waters recurring revenues also benefited by five additional calendar days and the positive impact of foreign currency translation which increased sales by 5% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) increased in all geographical regions primarily due to higher sales as a result of stronger demand for our products and services by our customers due to our customers resuming laboratory and manufacturing operations throughout the world. In the first quarter of 2021, Waters sales growth was broad-based and increased 35% in Europe, 11% in the Americas and 47% in Asia, with sales in China growing 129%. Foreign currency translation increased Waters sales by 11%, 3% and 8% in Europe, Asia and China, respectively. 30 Table of Contents TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 % of Total March 28, 2020 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 46,976 70% $ 34,109 67% 38% TA service 19,691 30% 16,619 33% 18% Total TA net sales $ 66,667 100% $ 50,728 100% 31% TA product and service sales were broad-based across all major geographies increasing 31% in the first quarter, driven by stronger demand as a result of our customers continuing to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations. The increase in TA instrument system sales in the first quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by strength in the U.S., Europe and China. The increase in TA service sales was primarily due to customers continuing to resume their operations after the restrictions caused by COVID-19 in 2020, as well as sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation increased TA’s sales by 3%. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the first quarter of 2021 increased 21% primarily due to the increase in sales volume. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to increase gross profit slightly for the remainder of 2021. To date, the Company has not had significant issues with its supply chain; however, the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on businesses could negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to deliver goods to us, as well as possibly increase the cost of those goods used in our manufacturing operations. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased 3% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, selling and administrative expenses were impacted by higher merit and incentive compensation costs, compared to the first quarter of 2020 which was impacted by $18 million of one-time severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination costs. Excluding these one-time expenses in 2020, selling and administrative expenses increased 10%. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation increased selling and administrative expenses by 3% in the first quarter of 2021. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 23.5% and 31.8% for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in this percentage is attributable to the increase in sales and the $18 million of one-time severance-related and lease termination costs in the first quarter of 2020. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 9% in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased research and development expenses by 1% in the quarter. Other Income (Expense), net During the first quarter of 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $10 million due to an observable change in the fair value of an existing investment the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over. Interest Expense, Net The decrease in net interest expense in the first quarter of 2021 was primarily attributable to lower outstanding debt balances and higher interest income on higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances. 31 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of April 3, 2021. The Company had a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The Company has a new Development and Expansion Incentive in Singapore that provides a concessionary income tax rate of 5% on certain types of income for the period April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2026. The effect of applying the concessionary income tax rates rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the quarter in 2021 and 2020 by $4 million and $2 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.06 and $0.04, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the 2021 and 2020 quarters was 14.8% and 7.4%, respectively. The income tax provision included a $2 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the first quarter of both 2021 and 2020. The effective tax rate for the 2020 quarter included a $4 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 7.1 percentage points for the 2020 quarter. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Net income $ 148,127 $ 53,562 Depreciation and amortization 31,356 29,188 Stock-based compensation 8,305 9,196 Deferred income taxes 2,787 (2,525 ) Change in accounts receivable 7,945 54,026 Change in inventories (30,544 ) (29,399 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (29,758 ) (15,825 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 89,048 46,465 Other changes (8,862 ) 6,947 Net cash provided by operating activities 218,404 151,635 Net cash used in investing activities (159,004 ) (130,175 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 188,775 32,918 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1,087 ) (32 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 247,088 $ 54,346 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $218 million and $152 million during the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher sales volumes in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding decreased to 84 days at April 3, 2021 as compared to 99 days at March 28, 2020. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $159 million and $130 million in the first quarter of April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $40 million and $51 million in the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash, investments and debt capacity. The Company incurred $14 million of costs associated with the construction of this facility during the three months ended April 3, 2021. The Company has incurred $166 million on this facility through the end of the first quarter of 2021. During the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company purchased $123 million and $4 million of investments, respectively, while $3 million and $1 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. 33 Table of Contents In January of 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, S.A. and its two operating subsidiaries, Andrew Alliance USA, Inc. and Andrew Alliance France, SASU (collectively “Andrew Alliance”), for $80 million, net of cash acquired. The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $4 million and included as part of the total consideration. Cash Flow from Financing Activities In March 2021, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Series N $100 million notes have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate of 1.68%. The Series O $400 million notes have a 10-year term and a fixed interest rate of 2.25% The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. During the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $350 million and $215 million, respectively. As of April 3, 2021, the Company had a total of $1.7 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1,410 million in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $300 million borrowed under a term loan under the credit agreement dated November 2017 (“2017 Credit Agreement”). As of April 3, 2021, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1.5 billion after outstanding letters of credit. As of April 3, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In 2018 and 2019, the Company entered into a total of $560 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. During the first quarter of 2021, $40 million of the Company’s interest rate cross-currency swaps had matured and resulted in a $3 million payment upon settlement. As of April 3, 2021, the Company had a total of $520 million of interest rate cross-currency swaps agreements outstanding. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company repurchased $173 million and $167 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $8 million and $9 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through January 21, 2023. The Company received $16 million and $12 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the three months ended April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $810 million as of April 3, 2021. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $317 million held by foreign subsidiaries at April 3, 2021, of which $256 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of April 3, 2021 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, with the exception of the recently issued senior unsecured notes as described in Note 6, “Debt.” From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 34 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2021, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the three months ended April 3, 2021. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the three months ended April 3, 2021.

These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including: portions of our global workforce being unable to work fully and/or effectively due to working remotely, illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons related to the pandemic, increased risks of cyber attacks resulting from our temporary remote working model, disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities or to our supply chain, volatility and uncertainty in global capital markets limiting our ability to access capital, customers being unable to make timely payment for purchases and volatility in demand for our products. • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; new or proposed tariffs or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. 36 Table of Contents Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of April 3, 2021, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $317 million out of $810 million and $364 million out of $443 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $256 million out of $810 million and $254 million out of $443 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at April 3, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of April 3, 2021, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of April 3, 2021 would decrease by approximately $25 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the three months ended April 3, 2021. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 3, 2021 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended April 3, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 37 Table of Contents Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended April 3, 2021 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.

CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s third fiscal quarters for 2020 and 2019 ended on September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 25, 2020. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. On March 13, 2020, President 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Trump announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. Since then, COVID-19 has continued to spread throughout the U.S. and globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the Company’s business and could result in a prolonged economic downturn. It is unclear whether increases in the number of infections will continue and amplify as certain areas of the economy are re-opened and restrictions are eased, or whether so called “second waves” of COVID-19 infections will be experienced in the U.S. and globally. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in the regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the nine months ended September 26, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2019, the Company experienced a decline in net sales of 7 % due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic uncertainty; however, through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no interim goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption to the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could result in a material impact to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $ 359 million out of $ 397 million and $ 249 million out of $ 337 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 262 million out of $ 397 million and $ 176 million out of $ 337 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for credit losses as of January 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective transition approach that was applied to the trade receivable balance as of January 1, 2020. This new accounting guidance required the Company to move from an incurred loss model to a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a net decrease of approximately $ 1 million to the Company’s stockholders’ deficit as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s balance sheets, results of operations or cash flows. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting 11 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. Any recovery of amounts that were written off prior to adoption of the new CECL standard that are received after adoption are recorded in income in the period in which they are received. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in thousands). The September 26, 2020 balance is calculated using the CECL method and the September 28, 2019 balance is calculated using the incurred loss method under legacy GAAP: Balance at Beginning of Period Impact of CECL Adoption Additions Deduction Balance at End of Period Allowance for Doubtful Accounts September 26, 2020 $ 9,560 $ 985 $ 7,826 $ ( 5,784 ) $ 12,587 September 28, 2019 $ 7,663 $ — $ 6,014 $ ( 5,461 ) $ 8,216 Other Investments During the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company made investments in unaffiliated companies of $ 4 million and $ 7 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 26, 2020, the Company recorded an unrealized loss on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 1 million within other expense on the income statement. This unrealized loss was recorded as a downward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 12 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 26, 2020 (in thousands): Total at September 26, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits $ 22,136 $ — $ 22,136 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 34,466 34,466 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 832 — 832 — Total $ 57,434 $ 34,466 $ 22,968 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,903 $ — $ — $ 2,903 Foreign currency exchange contracts 390 — 390 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 15,190 — 15,190 — Total $ 18,483 $ — $ 15,580 $ 2,903 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Total at December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits $ 1,642 $ — $ 1,642 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 30,158 30,158 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 16 — 16 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 4,485 4,485 Total $ 36,301 $ 30,158 $ 6,143 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,557 $ — $ — $ 2,557 Foreign currency exchange contracts 1,028 — 1,028 — Total $ 3,585 $ — $ 1,028 $ 2,557 Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. 13 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the July 2014 acquisition of Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. Although there is no contractual limit, the fair value of future contingent consideration payments was estimated to be $ 3 million at both September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, based on the Company’s best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products, some of which are currently in development, through 2034. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 910 million and $ 1.0 billion at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 938 million and $ 1.0 billion at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. 14 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of September 26, 2020, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ (deficit) equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): September 26, 2020 December 31, 2019 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 57,380 $ 832 $ 119,576 $ 16 Other current liabilities $ 65,536 $ 390 $ 29,495 $ 1,028 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other (liabilities) assets $ 560,000 $ ( 15,190 ) $ 560,000 $ 4,485 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income) $ 15,190 $ ( 4,485 ) The following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized gains (losses) on closed contracts Cost of sales $ 1,113 $ ( 3,340 ) $ ( 45 ) $ ( 5,858 ) Unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts Cost of sales 808 ( 633 ) 1,455 ( 1,040 ) Cumulative net pre-tax gains (losses) Cost of sales $ 1,921 $ ( 3,973 ) $ 1,410 $ ( 6,898 ) Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 3,777 $ 2,698 $ 11,275 $ 7,848 Unrealized gains on open contracts Stockholders’ deficit $ 19,582 $ 15,847 $ 19,675 $ 15,852 Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two -year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company repurchased 0.8 million and 8.6 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 167 million and $ 1.9 billion, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 11.1 million shares at a cost of $ 2.5 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 1.5 billion authorized for future repurchases. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 10 million and $ 8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, the Company has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 15 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had $ 20 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at December 31, 2019. These transactions were settled in January 2020. There were no unsettled treasury stock purchases as of September 26, 2020, while the Company had accrued $ 18 million for such purchases as of September 28, 2019, which settled in the subsequent quarter.​​​​​​​ Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals for Warranties Settlements Made Balance at End of Period Accrued warranty liability: September 26, 2020 $ 11,964 $ 5,442 $ ( 7,145 ) $ 10,261 September 28, 2019 $ 12,300 $ 5,271 $ ( 6,094 ) $ 11,477 Restructuring In January 2020, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 3 % of the Company’s employees. During the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020, the Company incurred $ 6 million and $ 27 million, respectively, of severance-related costs, lease termination costs and other related costs. The Company expects to incur an additional $ 4 million of costs for the remainder of the year. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in thousands): September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 213,695 $ 204,257 Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period ( 177,667 ) ( 174,929 ) Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 213,895 206,093 Balance at the end of the period $ 249,923 $ 235,421 The Company classified $ 39 million and $ 38 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 16 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The amount of deferred revenue and customer advances equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period presented.

The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $ 4 million and included as part of the total consideration. Andrew Alliance offers lab workflow automation solutions with the combination of its software platform and smart, connected laboratory equipment and accessories. The Company allocated $ 7 million of the purchase price to intangible assets comprised of developed technology, trade name and customer relationships. The developed technology and customer relationships will be amortized over ten years and the trade name will be amortized over 3 years. The Company allocated $ 72 million of the purchase price to goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The principal factor that resulted in recognition of goodwill in the acquisition was that the purchase price was based, in part, on cash flow projections assuming the integration of any acquired technology, distribution channels and products with the Company’s products, which are higher than if the acquired companies’ technology, customer access or products were utilized on a stand-alone basis. The goodwill also includes value assigned to assembled workforce, which cannot be recognized as an intangible asset. In addition, the sellers provided the Company with customary representations, warranties and indemnification, which would be settled in the future if and when a breach of the contractual representation or warranty condition occurs. The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired were determined using various income-approach valuation techniques, which use Level 3 inputs. The following table presents the fair values as of the acquisition date, as determined by the Company, of 100% of the assets and liabilities owned and recorded in connection with the acquisition of Andrew Alliance (in thousands): Cash $ 713 Accounts receivable and current other assets 806 Inventory 669 Prepaid and other assets 611 Property, plant and equipment, net 757 Operating lease assets 847 Intangible assets 6,960 Goodwill 71,632 Total assets acquired 82,995 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,093 Total consideration 80,902 Fair value of minority investment 3,525 Cash consideration paid $ 77,377 18 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The impact of the Andrew Alliance acquisition on the Company’s revenues and net income during the quarter was immaterial. The year-to-date pr o forma effect on the ongoing operations of the Company as though this acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the periods covered by this report was also immaterial. 6 Goodwill and Other Intangibles The carrying amount of goodwill was $ 431 million and $ 356 million at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The acquisition of Andrew Alliance increased goodwill by $ 72 million while the effect of foreign currency translation decreased goodwill by $ 3 million. The Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (dollars in thousands): September 26, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Weighted- Average Amortization Period Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Weighted- Average Amortization Period Capitalized software $ 542,127 $ 378,999 5 years $ 481,986 $ 333,255 5 years Purchased intangibles 209,877 159,747 11 years 200,523 151,722 11 years Trademarks and IPR&D 13,702 — — 13,782 — — Licenses 5,600 5,345 6 years 5,669 5,298 6 years Patents and other intangibles 86,972 59,019 8 years 83,035 54,517 8 years Total $ 858,278 $ 603,110 7 years $ 784,995 $ 544,792 7 years The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets increased by $ 25 million and $ 17 million, respectively, in the nine months ended September 26, 2020 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 15 million and $ 13 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 42 million and $ 38 million for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 55 million per year for each of the next five years. 7 Debt In November 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $ 1.5 billion revolving facility and a $ 300 million term loan. As of September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the revolving facility and term loan had a total of $ 615 million and $ 625 million, respectively, outstanding and mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. 19 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) As of September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a total of $ 960 million and $ 1.1 billion, respectively, of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. The Company had the following outstanding debt at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands): September 26, 2020 December 31, 2019 Foreign subsidiary lines of credit $ — $ 366 Senior unsecured notes – Series B – 5.00 %, due February 2020 — 100,000 Senior unsecured notes – Series E – 3.97 %, due March 2021 50,000 — Senior unsecured notes – Series F – 3.40 %, due June 2021 100,000 — Total notes payable and debt, current 150,000 100,366 Senior unsecured notes – Series E – 3.97 %, due March 2021 — 50,000 Senior unsecured notes – Series F – 3.40 %, due June 2021 — 100,000 Senior unsecured notes – Series G – 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes – Series H – floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes – Series I – 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes – Series K – 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes – Series L – 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes – Series M – 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Credit agreement 615,000 625,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 3,663 ) ( 4,203 ) Total long-term debt 1,421,337 1,580,797 Total debt $ 1,571,337 $ 1,681,163 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of both September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $ 1.2 billion after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 2.68 % and 3.39 % at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of September 26, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 108 million and $ 105 million at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. The weighted-average interest rate applicable to these short-term borrowings was 1.48 % for December 31, 2019. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of September 26, 2020. 20 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) As of September 26, 2020, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 8 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of September 26, 2020. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 by $ 12 million and $ 15 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.20 and $ 0.21 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 was 15.7 % and 16.1 %, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 was 14.3 % and 13.7 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 includes a $ 6 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges and a $ 3 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, for the nine months ended September 26, 2020. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 includes a $ 3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and a $ 7 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 0.7 percentage points and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, for the nine months ended September 28, 2019. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in thousands): September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 27,790 $ 26,108 Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period ( 427 ) ( 173 ) Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period 907 1,314 Balance at the end of the period $ 28,270 $ 27,249 With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2014. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of September 26, 2020, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of less than $ 1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 21 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various stockholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). In May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of September 26, 2020, the 2020 Plan had 6.5 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had stock options, restricted stock, and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding under the 2020 Plan. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Cost of sales $ 645 $ 531 $ 1,850 $ 1,673 Selling and administrative expenses 7,747 7,766 22,472 23,293 Research and development expenses 1,201 1,365 3,393 3,951 Total stock-based compensation $ 9,593 $ 9,662 $ 27,715 $ 28,917 Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate 22 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 are as follows: Nine Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Options issued in thousands 267 139 Risk-free interest rate 1.2 % 2.5 % Expected life in years 6 5 Expected volatility 27.8 % 24.3 % Expected dividends — — Nine Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Exercise price $ 215.12 $ 231.30 Fair value $ 62.93 $ 61.85 The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2019 1,455 $ 61.63 to $ 238.52 $ 158.61 Granted 267 $ 188.63 to $ 235.06 $ 215.12 Exercised ( 184 ) $ 61.63 to $ 208.47 $ 124.58 Canceled ( 150 ) $ 128.93 to $ 238.52 $ 176.27 Outstanding at September 26, 2020 1,388 $ 75.94 to $ 238.52 $ 172.08 Restricted Stock During the nine months ended September 26, 2020, the Company granted six thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 229.67 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted - Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2019 260 $ 184.70 Granted 119 $ 206.99 Vested ( 87 ) $ 162.12 Forfeited ( 18 ) $ 187.90 Unvested at September 26, 2020 274 $ 201.34 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants made in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 are as follows: Nine Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 58 13 Risk-free interest rate 1.3 % 2.4 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.8 Expected volatility 25.1 % 23.5 % Average volatility of peer companies 26.1 % 26.2 % Correlation coefficient 36.6 % 34.2 % Expected dividends — — The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the nine months ended September 26, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2019 105 $ 233.11 Granted 58 $ 190.45 Vested ( 36 ) $ 184.51 Forfeited ( 25 ) $ 231.35 Unvested at September 26, 2020 102 $ 226.44 24 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 10 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended September 26, 2020 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 126,769 62,002 $ 2.04 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 301 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 126,769 62,303 $ 2.03 Three Months Ended September 28, 2019 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 138,133 66,226 $ 2.09 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 542 ( 0.02 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 138,133 66,768 $ 2.07 Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 303,260 62,057 $ 4.89 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 314 ( 0.03 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 303,260 62,371 $ 4.86 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 391,529 68,952 $ 5.68 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 581 ( 0.05 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 391,529 69,533 $ 5.63 For the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020, the Company had 0.4 million and 0.5 million stock options, respectively, that were antidilutive due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. For both the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019, the Company had 0.1 million stock options that were antidilutive. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 25 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 11 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are detailed as follows (in thousands): Currency Translation Unrealized Loss on Retirement Plans Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 104,066 ) $ ( 15,405 ) $ ( 119,471 ) Other comprehensive loss, net of tax ( 7,156 ) ( 49 ) ( 7,205 ) Balance at September 26, 2020 $ ( 111,222 ) $ ( 15,454 ) $ ( 126,676 ) 12 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as follows for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Product net sales: Waters instrument systems $ 225,790 $ 223,859 $ 550,018 $ 647,248 Chemistry consumables 108,175 100,256 300,525 299,801 TA instrument systems 42,274 46,458 114,799 131,292 Total product sales 376,239 370,573 965,342 1,078,341 Service net sales: Waters service 199,501 188,031 562,843 556,128 TA service 18,044 18,674 50,522 55,833 Total service sales 217,545 206,705 613,365 611,961 Total net sales $ 593,784 $ 577,278 $ 1,578,707 $ 1,690,302 Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

Current guidance requires the recognition of a credit loss when it is considered probable that a loss event has occurred. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and non-credit components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted this new standard using a modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost which only impacted the Company’s allowance on trade accounts receivable. The Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet credit exposures which would be impacted by the new guidance. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under the new standard while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a net decrease of $ 1 million to stockholders’ deficit as of January 1, 2020 for the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard due to converting to the current expected credit loss model for the allowance recorded against trade accounts receivables. This accounting standard did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. 28 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of retirement benefit plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2019, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions within the current guidance, including the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendment also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance related to aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2020, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting guidance for equity method investments, joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The update clarifies the interaction between different sections of the accounting guidance that could be applicable and helps clarify which guidance should be applied in certain situations which should increase relevance and comparability of financial statement information. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In March 2020, accounting guidance was issued that facilitates the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company is still evaluating the impact of reference rate reform and whether this guidance will be adopted. In March 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 outbreak which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act, it does not currently believe it will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. 29 Table of Contents Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers. We have also not seen material disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. At every stage of the pandemic, we have taken decisive and appropriate actions, including a mandatory remote work policy for all employees with the exception of those in manufacturing, distribution, and certain laboratory environments, as well as restrictions on non-essential travel and visitors into our facilities. We have engaged a medical advisor to guide our policy deployment, and we continue to take proactive measures to guard the health of our global employee base, and the safety of all customer interactions. We have implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of our locations around the world and during the quarter we began implementation of the second phase of a multi-phase process for the safe return of employees to our physical workplaces as social distancing, governmental requirements and other protocols allow. The vast majority of the markets we serve, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and we are working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation. Over the last several years, we have executed on a digital workplace strategy focused on providing modern connectivity and collaboration tools to our employees. Our strategic technology investments have enabled us to swiftly meet remote working needs as the COVID-19 situation has escalated and evolved. From a customer-facing perspective, we are leveraging digital demand generation activities, including virtual demos across all regions in which we operate, remote instrument installations, virtual sales seminars, online product training, and a rapid acceleration in one-on-one communications over emails, phone and video conferencing. While we initially anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic would have the biggest impact on the Company’s financial results in the second quarter of 2020, and future quarters would improve as countries lifted their business restrictions, the new outbreaks of COVID-19 in the U.S. and elsewhere have demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be fluid with uncertainties and risks remaining across the global economy. The Company is taking a proactive approach to managing through this unpredictability and has implemented a series of cost reduction actions that include salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending and other working capital reductions in order to preserve liquidity and enhance financial flexibility. A significant portion of these cost reduction actions were completed at the end of July 2020, and the Company’s costs of sales and operating expenses are expected to gradually increase to more normal levels as we move through the remainder of 2020. These cost reductions reflect our core assumption that business conditions improve through the remainder of 2020 and into 2021; however, our plan will be adjusted accordingly depending on the pace of the recovery. 30 Table of Contents The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 % change September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 376,239 $ 370,573 2% $ 965,342 $ 1,078,341 (10% ) Service sales 217,545 206,705 5% 613,365 611,961 — Total net sales 593,784 577,278 3% 1,578,707 1,690,302 (7% ) Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 262,342 241,055 9% 686,120 711,632 (4% ) Selling and administrative expenses 135,430 126,036 7% 400,614 393,583 2% Research and development expenses 34,971 34,333 2% 101,115 105,883 (5% ) Purchased intangibles amortization 2,657 2,619 1% 7,900 7,164 10% Litigation provision — — — 1,180 — — Operating income 158,384 173,235 (9% ) 381,778 472,040 (19% ) Operating income as a % of sales 26.7% 30.0% 24.2% 27.9% Other expense (1,039 ) (496 ) 109% (2,149 ) (1,363 ) 58% Interest expense, net (6,908 ) (8,001 ) (14% ) (25,966 ) (16,826 ) 54% Income before income taxes 150,437 164,738 (9% ) 353,663 453,851 (22% ) Provision for income taxes 23,668 26,605 (11% ) 50,403 62,322 (19% ) Net income $ 126,769 $ 138,133 (8% ) $ 303,260 $ 391,529 (23% ) Net income per diluted common share $ 2.03 $ 2.07 (2% ) $ 4.86 $ 5.63 (14% ) In the third quarter of 2020, the Company’s sales increased 3% as compared to the third quarter of 2019. This increase in sales can be attributed to the increased demand for the Company’s products and services as business conditions improved as the interruption in business activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic across the world in 2020 were somewhat alleviated as our customers began to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 1% for the third quarter of 2020. For the first nine months of 2020, sales decreased by 7% as compared to the first nine months of 2019, as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused interruptions in business activities and uncertainties that resulted in our customers reducing purchases of our products and services. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by 1% year-to-date in 2020. The Company’s year-to-date sales in 2020 have one less calendar day as compared to the prior year. The Company will have two more calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Unless otherwise noted, sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared with the same period in the prior year. The Company’s acquisition of Andrew Alliance (as defined below) did not have a material impact on sales on either the quarter or year-to-date in 2020. Instrument system sales decreased 1% and 15% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, as a result of weaker demand for our products by our customers due to interruption of business activities and the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation in the third quarter was neutral and decreased instrument system sales by 1% for the first nine months of 2020. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 6% and were flat for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, also due to the interruption of business activities and the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Chemistry consumable sales increased 8% and were flat in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, while service sales increased 5% and were flat in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. In the third quarter, both chemistry consumable and service sales benefited from the increased demand for our products and services as our customers began to reopen laboratory and manufacturing operations. Recurring revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation, which increased sales by 1% in the third quarter; however, foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 1% year-to-date in 2020. 31 Table of Contents In the third quarter of 2020, the Company’s sales in Europe increased 11% with foreign currency translation adding 6% to Europe’s sales growth. The Americas’ sales grew 2%, as a 5% sales growth in the U.S. was partially offset by a decline in sales in Americas Other. Asia’s sales declined by 1% as China’s 4% sales growth was offset by declines in Japan as well as the other geographies in Asia. Year-to-date, the sales declines were broad-based across the world and were due to the weaker demand and disruption of business activities caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns, except in Europe where sales were flat as compared to the prior year. Foreign currency translation was neutral to Europe’s sales year-to-date. The Americas’ sales declined 7% year-to-date and Asia’s sales declined 11% with foreign currency translation negatively impacting sales by 1%. The year-to-date sales decline in Asia was primarily driven by the 20% decrease in sales in China. Sales in China increased 4% in the third quarter of 2020, improving from the 32% decline experienced in the first half of 2020, as the COVID-19 business restrictions in China were slowly lifted. Excluding China’s sales, the Company’s year-to-date sales declined 4% with foreign currency translation negatively impacting sales by 1%. Sales to our pharmaceutical and industrial customers in the third quarter improved as compared to the first half of 2020, as the demand for our products and services increased as these customers began to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations after the COVID-19 lockdowns. Sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 5% in the third quarter and decreased 5% year-to-date, as the decline was primarily driven by the disruption in business activities caused by COVID-19, and the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales by 1% for the third quarter and decreasing sales by 1% year-to-date. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, increased 5% in the third quarter and declined 6% year-to-date, primarily due to lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing sales by 2% for the third quarter and being neutral year-to-date. In addition, TA’s sales declined 7% and 12% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. Sales to academic and governmental customers declined by 8% and 17% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, as the demand for our products and services declined as the academic and governmental institutions adjusted their spending to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant decline in academic and governmental sales in both the third quarter and year-to-date occurred in China where sales declined 32% and 42%, respectively, as the government mandated spending reductions. Foreign currency translation decreased academic and governmental sales by 1% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2020. Sales to our academic and governmental customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. Operating income decreased 9% and 19% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. The third quarter operating income decrease can be attributed to the change in sales mix, unfavorable manufacturing absorption and unfavorable foreign currency translation. The year-to-date decline in operating income can be attributed to the decline in sales volumes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavorable manufacturing absorption and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Both the quarter and year-to-date operating income declines were somewhat mitigated by a series of cost reduction actions that included salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending that increased operating income by approximately $22 million in the third quarter and $81 million year-to-date versus our operating plan. Operating income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 also included $6 million and $27 million, respectively, of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination and exit costs. The Company’s plan was to reduce its expenses by approximately $100 million during 2020 to improve its financial position and liquidity to mitigate the impact of the decline in sales caused by COVID-19. The Company was able to realize approximately 85% of the cost action and restructuring savings year-to-date and the Company anticipates the remaining 15% of this savings plan will be achieved in the fourth quarter and the Company expects its spending to gradually return to more normal levels. This plan reflects our core assumption that business conditions improve throughout the remainder of 2020 and into 2021; however, this plan will be adjusted accordingly depending on the pace of recovery. The Company generated $523 million and $451 million of net cash flows from operations in the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of the $81 million reduction in expense from the cost actions implemented and working capital improvement during the third quarter of 2020. 32 Table of Contents Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $125 million and $110 million in the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In January of 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, S.A. and its two operating subsidiaries, Andrew Alliance USA, Inc. and Andrew Alliance France, SASU (collectively “Andrew Alliance”), for $80 million, net of cash acquired. The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $4 million and included as part of the total consideration. This acquisition is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s sales and expenses. The cash flows from investing activities in the first nine months of 2020 also included $50 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $131 million on this facility through the end of the first nine months of 2020 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. Due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the second and third quarters of 2020 the Company temporarily slowed down the remaining construction and buildout of this facility. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased $167 million and $1.9 billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits, the Company has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 % change September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 % change Net Sales: Asia: China $ 115,666 $ 111,657 4% $ 252,713 $ 314,544 (20% ) Japan 44,779 46,840 (4% ) 131,098 136,302 (4% ) Asia Other 75,737 79,278 (4% ) 219,660 226,276 (3% ) Total Asia 236,182 237,775 (1% ) 603,471 677,122 (11% ) Americas: United States 172,267 164,164 5% 465,093 487,261 (5% ) Americas Other 27,180 32,294 (16% ) 81,312 97,840 (17% ) Total Americas 199,447 196,458 2% 546,405 585,101 (7% ) Europe 158,155 143,045 11% 428,831 428,079 — Total net sales $ 593,784 $ 577,278 3% $ 1,578,707 $ 1,690,302 (7% ) In the third quarter of 2020, the Company’s sales increased 3% as compared to the third quarter of 2019. This increase in sales in the third quarter can be attributed to an improvement in business conditions as the interruption in business activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic improved as customers began to return from lockdowns. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company’s sales increased 5% in the U.S., 4% in China and 11% in Europe. Foreign currency translation added 6% to Europe’s sales growth in the third quarter of 2020. The Company’s sales decreased 4% in both Asia Other and Japan and 16% in Americas Other as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued affecting the business activities in these areas of the world. For the first nine months of 2020, sales decreased 7% as compared to the first nine months of 2019, as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused interruptions in business activities and uncertainties that resulted in our customers reducing purchases of our products and services. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by 1% year-to-date. The year-to-date sales declines occurred in all geographies and were a result of the weaker demand and disruption of business activities caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns, except in Europe where sales were flat year-to-date as compared to the prior year. The most significant decline in sales year-to-date occurred in China, where sales declined 20%, as well as declines of 5% in the U.S., 4% in Japan and 17% in Americas Other. 33 Table of Contents Sales by Trade Class Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 % change September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 % change Pharmaceutical $ 343,001 $ 328,227 5% $ 926,582 $ 972,884 (5%) Industrial 179,128 171,352 5% 474,592 502,679 (6%) Academic and governmental 71,655 77,699 (8%) 177,533 214,739 (17%) Total net sales $ 593,784 $ 577,278 3% $ 1,578,707 $ 1,690,302 (7%) Sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 5% in the third quarter as our customer demand improved during the quarter as customers began to return from the lockdowns. Year-to-date, sales declined 5% and can be attributed to the disruption in business activities caused by COVID-19, despite increased demand for our products and services from certain pharmaceutical customers who are involved with COVID-19 diagnostic testing and the development of new drugs and therapies. Foreign currency translation increased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 1% in the third quarter of 2020 and decreased sales by 1% year-to-date. Sales to industrial customers in the third quarter grew 5% as customer demand increased as customers began to resume laboratory and manufacturing operations as the COVID-19 lockdowns were lifted. Sales to industrial customers year-to-date declined 6%. Sales to industrial customers were significantly impacted by the TA sales declines of 7% and 12% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. The decreases in sales to academic and governmental customers were broad-based across all product classes as academic and governmental customers adjusted their spending to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 26, 2020 % of Total September 28, 2019 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 225,790 42% $ 223,859 44% 1% Chemistry consumables 108,175 21% 100,256 19% 8% Total Waters product sales 333,965 63% 324,115 63% 3% Waters service 199,501 37% 188,031 37% 6% Total Waters net sales $ 533,466 100% $ 512,146 100% 4% 34 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 % of Total September 28, 2019 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 550,018 39% $ 647,248 43% (15%) Chemistry consumables 300,525 21% 299,801 20% — Total Waters product sales 850,543 60% 947,049 63% (10%) Waters service 562,843 40% 556,128 37% 1% Total Waters net sales $ 1,413,386 100% $ 1,503,177 100% (6%) Waters products and service sales increased 4% for the quarter and declined 6% year-to-date. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) increased 1% in the quarter as the weaker demand for our products and services by our customers due to the disruption and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were partially alleviated as customers began to return to their workplaces as the lockdowns were lifted. Precision chemistry consumables sales increased in the quarter by 8% and were driven by the increase in demand in all geographies with Asia’s chemistry sales increasing 17% for the quarter. Chemistry sales year-to-date were flat. Waters service sales increased 6% and 1% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, on an increase in service demand billings as customers began to return to work after business restrictions were lifted. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by one less calendar day in the first nine months of 2020 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, which lowered sales by 1% year-to-date and increased sales by 1% in the third quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, Waters sales increased 13% in Europe, 5% in the U.S. and 2% in China as customer demand improved. Foreign currency translation increased Europe’s sales growth by 5%. All other geographies’ sales declined during the quarter. Year-to-date, Waters sales in Europe increased 2% while all other geographies’ sales declined year-to-date with the most significant decline in sales occurring in China, which was down 21% year-to-date. Year-to-date the impact of foreign currency on Europe’s sales were neutral. TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 26, 2020 % of Total September 28, 2019 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 42,274 70% $ 46,458 71% (9% ) TA service 18,044 30% 18,674 29% (3% ) Total TA net sales $ 60,318 100% $ 65,132 100% (7% ) Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 % of Total September 28, 2019 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 114,799 69% $ 131,292 70% (13% ) TA service 50,522 31% 55,833 30% (10% ) Total TA net sales $ 165,321 100% $ 187,125 100% (12% ) The decline in TA instrument system and service sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 was primarily due to lower customer demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2020. TA sales declined in all major regions in the third quarter and year-to-date, except for the U.S. and China where sales grew 3% and 16%, during the third quarter of 2020, respectively. 35 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2020 increased 9% due to the increase in sales volume, change in sales mix, unfavorable manufacturing absorption and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Cost of sales year-to-date decreased 4% on the lower sales volume, change in sales mix, unfavorable manufacturing absorption and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to be neutral to gross profit for the remainder of 2020. To date, the Company has not had significant issues with its supply chain; however, the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on businesses could negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to deliver goods to us, as well as possibly increase the cost of those goods used in our manufacturing operations. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 7% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in these periods can be attributed to the salary merit and incentive compensation increases along with the severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease-termination and exit costs. Severance and lease termination and exit costs were $6 million and $27 million for the third quarter and year-to-date in 2020, respectively. Offsetting these increases in selling and administrative expenses were $16 million and $54 million of savings, in the third quarter and year-to-date, respectively, which includes COVID-19 and restructuring cost saving actions that reduced planned salaries and non-essential spending. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation increased selling and administrative expenses by 2% for the third quarter and was neutral year-to-date. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 22.8% and 25.4% for the third quarter of 2020 and year-to-date, respectively, and 22.3% and 23.7% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 2% in the third quarter and decreased 5% year-to-date in 2020. The research and development expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date include $5 million and $14 million, respectively, of cost action savings from salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending. The year-to-date impact of foreign currency exchange was neutral. Interest Expense, Net The decrease in net interest expense in the third quarter of 2020 can be attributed to lower interest rates as compared to the prior year. The increase in net interest expense year-to-date in 2020 can be attributed to higher debt balances in 2020 compared to 2019. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of September 26, 2020. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to continue to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the nine months of 2020 and 2019 by $12 million and $15 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.20 and $0.21, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 was 15.7% and 16.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2020 and 2019 was 14.3% and 13.7%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of September 26, 2020 includes a $6 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges and a $3 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, for the first 36 Table of Contents nine months of September 26, 2020. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of September 28, 2019 includes a $3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and a $7 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 0.7 percentage points and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, for the first nine months of September 28, 2019. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 37 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Net income $ 303,260 $ 391,529 Depreciation and amortization 91,091 80,319 Stock-based compensation 27,715 28,917 Deferred income taxes 1,089 1,817 Change in accounts receivable 96,955 57,897 Change in inventories (8,139 ) (83,973 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities 46,721 (493 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 32,053 34,926 Effect of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act — (3,229 ) Other changes (67,720 ) (56,518 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 523,025 451,192 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (226,561 ) 825,441 Net cash used in financing activities (267,968 ) (1,661,541 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 10,723 (6,723 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 39,219 $ (391,631 ) Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $523 million and $451 million during the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of the $54 million reduction in expense from the cost actions and working capital reductions implemented in 2020. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding decreased to 76 days at September 26, 2020 as compared to 80 days at September 28, 2019. • The changes in inventory were primarily attributable to the reduction in the inventory build plan to adjust inventory levels for lower anticipated sales volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $227 million in the nine months ended September 26, 2020 compared to net cash provided by investing activities that totaled $825 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2019. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $125 million and $110 million in the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash, investments and debt capacity. The Company incurred $50 million of costs associated with the construction of this facility during the nine months ended September 26, 2020. The Company has incurred $131 million on this facility through the end of the third quarter of 2020. Due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily slowed down the completion of the remaining construction and buildout of this facility. 38 Table of Contents During the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company purchased $22 million and $36 million of investments, respectively, while $2 million and $978 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. On January 15, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, for $80 million, net of cash acquired. The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $4 million and included as part of the total consideration. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $110 million and $210 million, respectively. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had a total of $1.6 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $960 million in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $615 million borrowed under a term loan under the credit agreement dated November 2017 (“2017 Credit Agreement”). As of September 26, 2020, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1.2 billion after outstanding letters of credit. As of September 26, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In 2018 and 2019, the Company entered into a total of $560 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the first half of 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased $167 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $10 million and $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. The Company received $28 million and $34 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the nine months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $397 million as of September 26, 2020. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $359 million held by foreign subsidiaries at September 26, 2020, of which $262 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. While the Company believes it has sufficient levels of cash flow and access to its existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S., we have temporarily suspended our share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management believes, despite the impact of COVID-19 on our business, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 26, 2020 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 39 Table of Contents From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2020, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 26, 2020. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the nine months ended September 26, 2020.

Many of these statements appear, in particular, under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of the words “feels”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “expects”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “intends”, “suggests”, “appears”, “estimates”, “projects”, “should” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including: portions of our global workforce being unable to work fully and/or effectively due to working remotely, illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons related to the pandemic, increased risks of cyber attacks resulting from our temporary remote working model, disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities or to our supply chain, volatility and uncertainty in global capital markets limiting our ability to access capital, customers being unable to make timely payment for purchases and volatility in demand for our products. • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; new or proposed tariffs or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the U.K. voting to exit the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. 41 Table of Contents • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of September 26, 2020, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $359 million out of $397 million and $249 million out of $337 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $262 million out of $397 million and $176 million out of $337 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at September 26, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of September 26, 2020 would decrease by approximately $18 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ (deficit) equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the nine months ended September 26, 2020. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 26, 2020 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 26, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 42 Table of Contents Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended September 26, 2020 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of September 26, 2020 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K, other than those included below. Note, however, the discussion under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s business has been and may continue to be negatively affected by outbreaks of disease, such as epidemics or pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic . Outbreaks of disease, such as epidemics or pandemics, have and could continue to negatively affect the Company’s business. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. On March 13, 2020, President Trump announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. Since then, COVID-19 has continued to spread throughout the U.S. and globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the Company’s business and could result in a prolonged economic downturn. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in the regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries, including the U.S., have implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations. Such measures have had and are expected to continue to have adverse impacts on the U.S. and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration and have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the Company’s operations, including the Company’s sales, supply chain and cash flow. Certain jurisdictions have experienced increased numbers of COVID-19 infections following the re-openings of their economies and easing of restrictions, which, in some cases, has required closings of certain business activity and the imposition of other restrictions in response. It is unclear whether the increases in the number of infections will continue and amplify or whether any so-called “second waves” of COVID-19 infections will be experienced in the United States or elsewhere and, if so, what the impact of that would be on human health and safety, the economy and our business. Additionally, the widespread pandemic has caused and is expected to continue to cause significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce the Company’s ability to access capital. The COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if our manufacturing facilities or those of third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. We may also see disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has transitioned the majority of its workforce to a temporary remote working model, which may result in the Company experiencing lower workforce efficiency and productivity, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. As company employees work from home and access the Company’s system remotely, the Company may be subject to heightened security risks, including the risks of cyber attacks. Additionally, if any of the Company’s key management employees are unable to perform their duties for a period of time, including as the result of illness, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 43 Table of Contents The Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may continue to impact the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial positions, results of operations and cash flows.

This new program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 44 Table of Contents Item 6: Exhibits Exhibit Number Description of Document 10.1 President and Chief Executive Employment Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.2 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 27, 2020 (File No. 001-14010)). 10.2 Change of Control/Severance Agreement, dated July 14, 2020 between Waters Corporation and Udit Batra (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.3 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 27, 2020 (File No. 001-14010)). 31.1 Chief Executive Officer Certification Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 31.2 Chief Financial Officer Certification Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 32.1 Chief Executive Officer Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

financial statements. 9 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and , together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s second fiscal quarters for 2020 and 2019 ended on June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 25, 2020. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. On March 13, 2020, President Trump announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. Since then, COVID-19 has continued to spread 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) throughout the U.S. and globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the Company’s business and could result in a prolonged economic downturn. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in the regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the six months ended June 27, 2020 as compared to the six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company experienced a decline in net sales of 12 % due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic uncertainty; however, through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption to the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could result in a material impact to its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $ 288 million out of $ 356 million and $ 249 million out of $ 337 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 204 million out of $ 356 million and $ 176 million out of $ 337 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for credit losses as of January 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective transition approach that was applied to the trade receivable balance as of January 1, 2020. This new accounting guidance required the Company to move from an incurred loss model to a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a net decrease of approximately $ 1 million to the Company’s stockholders’ deficit as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s balance sheets, results of operations or cash flows. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant 11 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized, then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. Any recovery of amounts that were written off prior to adoption of the new CECL standard that are received after adoption are recorded in income in the period in which they are received. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for the three and six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in thousands). The June 27, 2020 balance is calculated using the CECL method and the June 29, 2019 balance is calculated using the incurred loss method under legacy GAAP: Balance at Beginning of Period Impact of CECL Adoption Additions Deduction Balance at End of Period Allowance for Doubtful Accounts June 27, 2020 $ 9,560 $ 985 $ 6,664 $ ( 3,901 ) $ 13,308 June 29, 2019 $ 7,663 $ — $ 3,793 $ ( 3,426 ) $ 8,030 Other Investments During the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, the Company made investments in unaffiliated companies of $ 3 million and $ 5 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 27, 2020, the Company recorded an unrealized loss on an equity security still held at the reporting date of approximately $ 1 million within other expense on the income statement. This unrealized loss was recorded as a downward price adjustment to the carrying value of the investment due to an observable price change of a similar security issued during the current period. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 12 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 27, 2020 (in thousands): Total at June 27, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits $ 16,720 $ — $ 16,720 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 33,453 33,453 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 366 — 366 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 4,392 — 4,392 — Total $ 54,931 $ 33,453 $ 21,478 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,787 $ — $ — $ 2,787 Foreign currency exchange contracts 733 — 733 — Total $ 3,520 $ — $ 733 $ 2,787 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Total at December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits $ 1,642 $ — $ 1,642 $ — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 30,158 30,158 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 16 — 16 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 4,485 4,485 Total $ 36,301 $ 30,158 $ 6,143 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,557 $ — $ — $ 2,557 Foreign currency exchange contracts 1,028 — 1,028 — Total $ 3,585 $ — $ 1,028 $ 2,557 Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities 13 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the July 2014 acquisition of Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. Although there is no contractual limit, the fair value of future contingent consideration payments was estimated to be $ 3 million at both June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, based on the Company’s best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products, some of which are currently in development, through 2034. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 910 million and $ 1.0 billion at June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 938 million and $ 1.0 billion at June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. 14 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of June 27, 2020, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ (deficit) equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): June 27, 2020 December 31, 2019 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 29,735 $ 366 $ 119,576 $ 16 Other current liabilities $ 91,393 $ 733 $ 29,495 $ 1,028 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other assets $ 560,000 $ 4,392 $ 560,000 $ 4,485 Accumulated other comprehensive income $ ( 4,392 ) $ ( 4,485 ) The following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts (in thousands): Financial Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Statement June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Classification Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized gains (losses) on closed contracts Cost of sales $ 1,823 $ 136 $ ( 1,157 ) $ ( 407 ) Unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts Cost of sales ( 678 ) ( 3,044 ) 646 ( 2,518 ) Cumulative net pre-tax gains (losses) Cost of sales $ 1,145 $ ( 2,908 ) $ ( 511 ) $ ( 2,925 ) Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 3,784 $ 2,923 $ 7,498 $ 5,150 Unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts Stockholders’ equity $ ( 5,615 ) $ ( 6,022 ) $ ( 93 ) $ 1,098 Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, the Company repurchased 0.8 million and 5.9 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 167 million and $ 1.3 billion, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. As of June 27, 2020, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 11.1 million shares at a cost of $ 2.5 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 1.5 billion authorized for future repurchases. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 9 million and $ 8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions, the Company has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 15 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had $ 20 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at December 31, 2019. These transactions were settled in January 2020. There were no unsettled treasury stock purchases as of June 27, 2020, while the Company had accrued $ 10 million for such purchases as of June 29, 2019, which settled in the subsequent quarter. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals for Warranties Settlements Made Balance at End of Period Accrued warranty liability: June 27, 2020 $ 11,964 $ 3,577 $ ( 5,428 ) $ 10,113 June 29, 2019 $ 12,300 $ 3,571 $ ( 4,288 ) $ 11,583 Restructuring In January 2020, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 3 % of the Company’s employees. During the three and six months ended June 27, 2020, the Company incurred $ 18 million and $ 3 million, respectively, of severance-related costs, lease termination costs and other related costs. The Company expects to incur an additional $ 6 million of costs for the remainder of the year. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in thousands): June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 213,695 $ 204,257 Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period ( 141,297 ) ( 172,949 ) Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 195,444 229,162 Balance at the end of the period $ 267,842 $ 260,470 The Company classified $ 54 million and $ 38 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 16 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The amount of deferred revenue and customer advances equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period presented.

The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $ 4 million and included as part of the total consideration. Andrew Alliance offers lab workflow automation solutions with the combination of its software platform and smart, connected laboratory equipment and accessories. The Company allocated $ 7 million of the purchase price to intangible assets comprised of developed technology, trade name and customer relationships. The developed technology and customer relationships will be amortized over ten years and the trade name will be amortized over 3 years. The Company allocated $ 72 million of the purchase price to goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The principal factor that resulted in recognition of goodwill in the acquisition was that the purchase price was based, in part, on cash flow projections assuming the integration of any acquired technology, distribution channels and products with the Company’s products, which are higher than if the acquired companies’ technology, customer access or products were utilized on a stand-alone basis. The goodwill also includes value assigned to assembled workforce, which cannot be recognized as an intangible asset. In addition, the sellers provided the Company with customary representations, warranties and indemnification, which would be settled in the future if and when a breach of the contractual representation or warranty condition occurs. The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired were determined using various income-approach valuation techniques, which use Level 3 inputs. The following table presents the fair values as of the acquisition date, as determined by the Company, of 100% of the assets and liabilities owned and recorded in connection with the acquisition of Andrew Alliance (in thousands): Cash $ 713 Accounts receivable and current other assets 806 Inventory 669 Prepaid and other assets 611 Property, plant and equipment, net 757 Operating lease assets 847 Intangible assets 6,960 Goodwill 71,632 Total assets acquired 82,995 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,093 Total consideration 80,902 Fair value of minority investment 3,525 Cash consideration paid $ 77,377 18 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The impact of the Andrew Alliance acquisition on the Company’s revenues and net income during the quarter was immaterial. The pro forma effect on the ongoing operations of the Company as though this acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the periods covered by this report was also immaterial . 6 Goodwill and Other Intangibles The carrying amount of goodwill was $ 427 million and $ 356 million at June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The acquisition of Andrew Alliance increased goodwill by $ 72 million while the effect of foreign currency translation decreased goodwill by $ 1 million. The Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (dollars in thousands): June 27, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Weighted- Average Amortization Period Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Weighted- Average Amortization Period Capitalized software $ 512,047 $ 356,036 5 years $ 481,986 $ 333,255 5 years Purchased intangibles 207,733 156,065 11 years 200,523 151,722 11 years Trademarks and IPR&D 13,601 — — 13,782 — — Licenses 5,483 5,195 6 years 5,669 5,298 6 years Patents and other intangibles 84,453 57,028 8 years 83,035 54,517 8 years Total $ 823,317 $ 574,324 7 years $ 784,995 $ 544,792 7 years The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets in creased by $ 4 million and $ 3 million, respectively, in the six months ended June 27, 2020 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 14 million and $ 12 million for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 27 million and $ 25 million for the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 , respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 51 million per year for each of the next five years. 7 Debt In November 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $ 1.5 billion revolving facility and a $ 300 million term loan. The revolving facility and term loan both mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. 19 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) As of June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a total of $ 960 million and $ 1.1 billion, respectively, of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. The Company had the following outstanding debt at June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands): June 27, 2020 December 31, 2019 Foreign subsidiary lines of credit $ — $ 366 Senior unsecured notes - Series B - 5.00 %, due February 2020 — 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series E - 3.97 %, due March 2021 50,000 — Senior unsecured notes - Series F - 3.40 %, due June 2021 100,000 — Total notes payable and debt, current 150,000 100,366 Senior unsecured notes - Series E - 3.97 %, due March 2021 — 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series F - 3.40 %, due June 2021 — 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series L - 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series M - 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Credit agreement 740,000 625,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 3,841 ) ( 4,203 ) Total long-term debt 1,546,159 1,580,797 Total debt $ 1,696,159 $ 1,681,163 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $ 1.1 b illion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively, after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 2.62 % and 3.39 % at June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of June 27, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 105 million at each of June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. The weighted-average interest rate applicable to these short-term borrowings was 1.48 % for December 31, 2019. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of June 27, 2020. 20 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) As of June 27, 2020, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 8 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of June 27, 2020. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 by $ 7 million and $ 9 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.11 and $ 0.13 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 was 15.4 % and 15.9 %, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 was 13.2 % and 12.4 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 27, 2020 includes a $ 5 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges and a $ 2 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points and 1.2 percentage points for the six months ended June 27, 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 29, 2019 includes a $ 3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts a nd Jobs Act of 2017 and a $ 7 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 1.0 percentage point and 2.3 percentage points for the six months ended June 29, 2019 , respectively . The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in thousands): June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 27,790 $ 26,108 Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period ( 252 ) ( 105 ) Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period 536 801 Balance at the end of the period $ 28,074 $ 26,804 With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2014. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of June 27, 2020, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of less than $ 1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 21 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various stockholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). In May 2020, the Company’s s tock holders approved the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). As of June 27, 2020, the 2020 Plan ha d 6.6 million shares available for grant in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or restricted stock unit conversion. Under the 2020 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2020 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2030. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. A SAR may be granted alone or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units may be issued under the 2020 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of June 27, 2020, the Company had stock options, restricted stock, and restricted and performance stock unit awards outstanding under t he 2020 Plan . The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Cost of sales $ 635 $ 567 $ 1,205 $ 1,142 Selling and administrative expenses 7,352 7,402 14,725 15,527 Research and development expenses 939 1,345 2,192 2,586 Total stock-based compensation $ 8,926 $ 9,314 $ 18,122 $ 19,255 22 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 are as follows: Six Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Options issued in thousands 227 139 Risk-free interest rate 1.4 % 2.5 % Expected life in years 6 5 Expected volatility 26.5 % 24.3 % Expected dividends — — Six Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Exercise price $ 216.08 $ 231.30 Fair value $ 61.70 $ 61.85 The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the six months ended June 27, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2019 1,455 $ 61.63 to $ 238.52 $ 158.61 Granted 227 $ 203.37 to $ 235.06 $ 216.08 Exercised ( 87 ) $ 61.63 to $ 208.47 $ 125.50 Canceled ( 148 ) $ 128.93 to $ 238.52 $ 172.91 Outstanding at June 27, 2020 1,447 $ 75.94 to $ 238.52 $ 168.15 Restricted Stock During the six months ended June 27, 2020, the Company granted four thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 235.06 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the six months ended June 27, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2019 260 $ 184.70 Granted 105 $ 206.73 Vested ( 86 ) $ 161.84 Forfeited ( 15 ) $ 185.91 Unvested at June 27, 2020 264 $ 200.84 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the grants mad e in 2020, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 are as follows: Six Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 58 13 Risk-free interest rate 1.3 % 2.4 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.8 Expected volatility 25.1 % 23.5 % Average volatility of peer companies 26.1 % 26.2 % Correlation coefficient 36.6 % 34.2 % Expected dividends — — The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the six months ended June 27, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2019 105 $ 233.11 Granted 58 $ 190.45 Vested ( 37 ) $ 184.51 Forfeited ( 24 ) $ 233.31 Unvested at June 27, 2020 102 $ 226.44 24 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 10 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended June 27, 2020 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 122,929 61,944 $ 1.98 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 240 — Net income per diluted common share $ 122,929 62,184 $ 1.98 Three Months Ended June 29, 2019 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 144,410 68,989 $ 2.09 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 505 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 144,410 69,494 $ 2.08 Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 176,491 62,085 $ 2.84 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 319 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 176,491 62,404 $ 2.83 Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 Net Income (Numerator) Weighted- Average Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income per basic common share $ 253,396 70,331 $ 3.60 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance s to ck unit and restricted stock unit securities — 573 ( 0.03 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 253,396 70,904 $ 3.57 For the three and six months ended June 27, 2020, the Company had 0.7 million and 0.4 million stock options that were antidilutive due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. For both the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company had 0.1 million stock options that were antidilutive. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. ​​​​​​​ 25 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 11 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are detailed as follows (in thousands): Currency Translation Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Retirement Plans Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 104,066 ) $ ( 15,405 ) $ ( 119,471 ) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax ( 7,757 ) 338 ( 7,419 ) Balance at June 27, 2020 $ ( 111,822 ) $ ( 15,067 ) $ ( 126,890 ) 1 2 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as follows for the three and six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Product net sales: Waters instrument systems $ 181,399 $ 238,777 $ 324,228 $ 423,389 Chemistry consumables 95,105 100,292 192,350 199,545 TA instrument systems 38,416 48,196 72,525 84,834 Total product sales 314,920 387,265 589,103 707,768 Service net sales: Waters service 189,205 192,048 363,342 368,097 TA service 15,859 19,849 32,478 37,159 Total service sales 205,064 211,897 395,820 405,256 Total net sales $ 519,984 $ 599,162 $ 984,923 $ 1,113,024 2 7 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – ( Continued ) Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

Current guidance requires the recognition of a credit loss when it is considered probable that a loss event has occurred. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and non-credit components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted this new standard using a modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost which only impacted the Company’s allowance on trade accounts receivable. The Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet credit exposures which would be impacted by the new guidance. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under the new standard while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a net decrease of $1 million to stockholders’ deficit as of January 1, 2020 for the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard due to converting to the current expected credit loss model for the allowance recorded against trade accounts receivables. This accounting standard did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of retirement benefit plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2019, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions within the current guidance, including the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendment also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance related to aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2020, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting guidance for equity method investments, joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The update clarifies the interaction between different sections of the accounting guidance that could be applicable and helps clarify which guidance should be applied in certain situations which should increase relevance and comparability of financial statement information. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 29 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In March 2020, accounting guidance was issued that facilitates the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company is still evaluating the impact of reference rate reform and whether this guidance will be adopted. In March 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 outbreak which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act, it does not currently believe it will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. 3 0 Table of Contents Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and, together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our manufacturing facilities or those of the third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers. We have also not seen material disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. At every stage of the pandemic, we have taken decisive and appropriate actions, including a mandatory remote work policy for all employees with the exception of those in manufacturing, distribution, and certain laboratory environments, as well as bans on non-essential travel and visitors into our facilities. Early on, we engaged a medical advisor to guide our policy deployment, and we continue to take proactive measures to guard the health of our global employee base, and the safety of all customer interactions. We have implemented rigorous protocols to promote a safe work environment in all of our locations around the world and late in the quarter we began implementation of the first phase of a multi-phase process for the safe return of employees to our physical workplaces as social distancing requirements allow. The vast majority of the markets we serve, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and we are working closely with these customers to facilitate their seamless operation. Over the last several years, we have executed on a digital workplace strategy focused on providing modern connectivity and collaboration tools to our employees. Our strategic technology investments have enabled us to swiftly meet remote working needs as the COVID-19 situation has escalated and evolved. From a customer-facing perspective, we are leveraging digital demand generation activities, including virtual demos across all regions in which we operate, remote instrument installations, virtual sales seminars, online product training, and a rapid acceleration in one-on-one communications over emails, phone and video conferencing. While we initially anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic would have the biggest impact on the Company’s financial results in the second quarter of 2020, and future quarters would improve as countries lifted their business restrictions, the new outbreaks of COVID-19 in the U.S. and elsewhere have demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be fluid with uncertainties and risks remaining across the global economy. The Company is taking a proactive approach to managing through this unpredictability and has implemented a series of cost reduction actions that include salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending and other working capital reductions in order to preserve liquidity and enhance financial flexibility. A significant portion of these cost reduction actions are expected to expire at the end of July 2020, and the Company’s costs of sales and operating expenses are expected to gradually increase to pre-COVID-19 levels as we move through the remainder of 2020. These expected cost reductions reflect our core assumptions that the business moves through the recovery phase, and business conditions improve in the second half of 2020; however, our plan will be adjusted accordingly depending on the pace of the recovery. 31 Table of Contents The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 % change June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 314,920 $ 387,265 (19 %) $ 589,103 $ 707,768 (17 %) Service sales 205,064 211,897 (3 %) 395,820 405,256 (2 %) Total net sales 519,984 599,162 (13 %) 984,923 1,113,024 (12 %) Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 213,134 249,546 (15 %) 423,778 470,577 (10 %) Selling and administrative expenses 117,449 133,208 (12 %) 265,184 267,547 (1 %) Research and development expenses 31,155 36,490 (15 %) 66,144 71,550 (8 %) Purchased intangibles amortization 2,618 2,264 16 % 5,243 4,545 15 % Litigation provision 514 — — 1,180 — — Operating income 155,114 177,654 (13 %) 223,394 298,805 (25 %) Operating income as a % of sales 29.8 % 29.7 % 22.7 % 26.8 % Other expense (736 ) (342 ) 115 % (1,110 ) (867 ) 28 % Interest expense, net (9,015 ) (5,577 ) 62 % (19,058 ) (8,825 ) 116 % Income before income taxes 145,363 171,735 (15 %) 203,226 289,113 (30 %) Provision for income taxes 22,434 27,325 (18 %) 26,735 35,717 (25 %) Net income $ 122,929 $ 144,410 (15 %) $ 176,491 $ 253,396 (30 %) Net income per diluted common share $ 1.98 $ 2.08 (5 %) $ 2.83 $ 3.57 (21 %) In the second quarter of 2020, the Company’s sales decreased 13% as compared to the second quarter of 2019 and decreased 12% for the first half of 2020 as compared to the first half of 2019. This decline in sales in the 2020 periods can be attributed to the interruption in business activities caused by the uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic across the world. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by 1% for both the second quarter and first half of 2020. Unless otherwise noted, sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared with the same period in the prior year. Instrument system sales decreased 23% for the second quarter and 22% for the first half of 2020 as a result of weaker demand for our products by our customers due to interruption of business activities and the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales by 1% for the first half of 2020. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) decreased 4% and 3% for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, also as a result of interruption of business activities and the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Chemistry consumable sales decreased 5% and 4% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, while service sales declined 3% and 2% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. Recurring revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 1% in both the second quarter and first half of 2020, as well as the first half of 2020 having one less calendar day as compared to the first half of 2019. In both the second quarter and first half of 2020, the Company’s sales declined across all major geographies. The broad-based decline in sales was a result of the weaker demand and disruption of business activities caused be the COVID-19 lockdowns. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company’s sales decreased 13% in Asia, 15% in the Americas, and 11% in Europe. For the first half of 2020, the Company’s sales decreased 16% in Asia, 11% in the Americas, and 5% in Europe. Foreign currency translation decreased Asia’s sales by 1% in both the second quarter and first half of 2020 and decreased Europe’s sales by 2% in both the second quarter and first half of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company’s sales decreased 20% in China, 14% in the U.S., 4% in Asia Other, and 10% in Japan, with foreign currency translation negatively impacting Asia Other sales by 1% and benefiting Japan sales by 1%. In the first half of 2020, sales decreased 32% in China, 9% in the U.S., 2% in Asia Other and 4% in Japan, with foreign currency translation negatively impacting China sales by 1%, Asia Other sales by 2%, and benefiting Japan sales by 1%. 32 Table of Contents Sales in China declined 20% in the second quarter of 2020, improving from the 48% decline experienced in the first quarter of 2020, as the COVID-19 business restrictions in China were slowly lifted. Excluding China, the Company’s sales in the first half of 2020 declined 7%, with foreign currency translation negatively impacting sales by 1%. Sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 11% for the second quarter and 9% for the first half of 2020, primarily due to the disruption in business activities caused by COVID-19, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales by 1% for both the second quarter and first half of 2020. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, declined 14% in the second quarter and 11% in the first half of 2020, primarily due to lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales by 1% for both the second quarter and first half of 2020. Similarly, TA sales declined 20% and 14% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. For the first half of 2020, the most significant decline in academic and governmental sales occurred in China where sales were 48% lower than the comparable 2019 period on mandated governmental spending reductions. Combined sales to academic and governmental customers decreased 22% and 23% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, as governmental customers adjusted their spending to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation decreased academic and governmental sales by 1% for both the second quarter and first half of 2020. Sales to our academic and governmental customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. Operating income decreased 13% and 25% for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. The decreases were primarily a result of the decline in sales volumes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and were somewhat mitigated by a series of cost reduction actions that included salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending that increased operating income by approximately $60 million for the first half of 2020 versus our operating plan. In addition, operating income in the second quarter and first half of 2020 also included $3 million and $21 million, respectively, of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination costs. The Company’s plan was to reduce its expenses by approximately $100 million compared to our internal operating plan during 2020 to improve its financial position and liquidity to mitigate the impact of the decline in sales caused by COVID-19. The Company was able to realize approximately 60% of the cost action and restructuring savings in the first half of 2020 and the Company anticipates the remaining 40% of this savings plan will be achieved in the second half of 2020 when the Company currently expects its spending to gradually return to pre-COVID-19 levels. This plan reflects our core assumptions that the business moves through the recovery phase, and business conditions improve in the second half of 2020; however, our plan will be adjusted accordingly depending on the pace of the recovery. The Company generated $350 million and $303 million of net cash flows from operations in the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of the $54 million reduction in expense from the cost actions implemented during the second quarter of 2020. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $97 million and $65 million in the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In January of 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, S.A. and its two operating subsidiaries, Andrew Alliance USA, Inc. and Andrew Alliance France, SASU (collectively “Andrew Alliance”), for $80 million, net of cash acquired. The company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $4 million and included as part of the total consideration. This acquisition is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s sales and expenses. The cash flows from investing activities in the first half of 2020 also included $43 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $123 million on this facility through the end of the first half of 2020 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. Due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the second quarter of 2020 the Company temporarily slowed down the remaining construction and buildout of this facility. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the first half of 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased $167 million and $1.3 billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits, the Company has temporarily suspended its share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three and six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 % change June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 % change Net Sales: Asia: China $ 89,816 $ 112,796 (20 %) $ 137,047 $ 202,887 (32 %) Japan 41,230 45,958 (10 %) 86,319 89,462 (4 %) Asia Other 77,163 80,081 (4 %) 143,923 146,998 (2 %) Total Asia 208,209 238,835 (13 %) 367,289 439,347 (16 %) Americas: United States 148,928 173,940 (14 %) 292,826 323,097 (9 %) Americas Other 25,854 32,835 (21 %) 54,132 65,546 (17 %) Total Americas 174,782 206,775 (15 %) 346,958 388,643 (11 %) Europe 136,993 153,552 (11 %) 270,676 285,034 (5 %) Total net sales $ 519,984 $ 599,162 (13 %) $ 984,923 $ 1,113,024 (12 %) In the second quarter and first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted businesses throughout the world and negatively impacted the Company’s sales across all major geographies. Sales in China declined 20% and 32% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, and sales in the U.S. declined 14% and 9% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three and six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 % change June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 % change Pharmaceutical $ 311,018 $ 350,145 (11 %) $ 583,581 $ 644,657 (9 %) Industrial 152,110 176,109 (14 %) 295,464 331,327 (11 %) Academic and governmental 56,856 72,908 (22 %) 105,878 137,040 (23 %) Total net sales $ 519,984 $ 599,162 (13 %) $ 984,923 $ 1,113,024 (12 %) In the second quarter and first half of 2020, the decline in sales to pharmaceutical customers was primarily due to the disruption in business activities caused by COVID-19, despite increased demand for our products and services from certain pharmaceutical customers who are involved with COVID-19 diagnostic testing and the development of new drugs and therapies. Foreign currency translation decreased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 1% in both the second quarter and first half of 2020. The decline in sales to industrial customers in the quarter was primarily due to the lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, TA sales declined of 20% and 14% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. The decreases in sales to academic and governmental customers were broad-based across all product classes as governmental customers adjusted their spending to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 34 Table of Contents Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services were as follows for the three and six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended June 27, 2020 % of Total June 29, 2019 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 181,399 39 % $ 238,777 45 % (24 %) Chemistry consumables 95,105 20 % 100,292 19 % (5 %) Total Waters product sales 276,504 59 % 339,069 64 % (18 %) Waters service 189,205 41 % 192,048 36 % (1 %) Total Waters net sales $ 465,709 100 % $ 531,117 100 % (12 %) Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 % of Total June 29, 2019 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 324,228 37 % $ 423,389 43 % (23 %) Chemistry consumables 192,350 22 % 199,545 20 % (4 %) Total Waters product sales 516,578 59 % 622,934 63 % (17 %) Waters service 363,342 41 % 368,097 37 % (1 %) Total Waters net sales $ 879,920 100 % $ 991,031 100 % (11 %) The effect of foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales by 1% for the first half of 2020. Precision chemistry consumables sales decreased in the second quarter and first half of 2020, primarily driven by decreased sales in the U.S., as the demand for chemistry consumables was impacted by the disruption and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, while demand in China increased in the second quarter which resulted in 23% growth in the quarter and 5% growth for the first half of 2020. Waters service sales decreased on lower service demand billings due to COVID-19 business closures, particularly in Europe and India. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by one less calendar day in the first half of 2020 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, which lowered sales by 1% in both the second quarter and first half of 2020. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) decreased in all geographical regions, primarily due to lower sales as a result of weaker demand for our products and services by our customers due to the disruption and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second quarter of 2020, Waters sales decreased 8% in Europe, 13% in the U.S. and 21% in China due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Waters sales in Europe and China were also negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation by 2% and 1%, respectively. In the first half of 2020, Waters sales decreased 3% in Europe, 9% in the U.S. and 34% in China due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Waters sales in Europe and China were also both negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation by 2%. 35 Table of Contents TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services were as follows for the three and six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended June 27, 2020 % of Total June 29, 2019 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 38,416 71 % $ 48,196 71 % (20 %) TA service 15,859 29 % 19,849 29 % (20 %) Total TA net sales $ 54,275 100 % $ 68,045 100 % (20 %) Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 % of Total June 29, 2019 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 72,525 69 % $ 84,834 70 % (15 %) TA service 32,478 31 % 37,159 30 % (13 %) Total TA net sales $ 105,003 100 % $ 121,993 100 % (14 %) The decline in TA instrument system and service sales in the second quarter and first half of 2020 was primarily due to lower customer demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales for the second quarter of 2020 and decreased TA sales 1% for the first half of 2020. TA sales declined in all major regions of the world due to the impact from COVID-19, except for Asia Other, where sales grew over 10% in both the second quarter and first half of 2020. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the second quarter and first half of 2020 decreased 15% and 10%, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in sales volume from lower customer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was mitigated by a $12 million reduction of planned expenses from salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending. In addition, cost of sales was also negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to negatively impact gross profit for the remainder of 2020. To date, the Company has not had significant issues with its supply chain; however, the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on businesses could negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to deliver goods to us, as well as possibly increase the cost of those goods used in our manufacturing operations. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased 12% and 1% for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses decreased in these periods primarily from the $33 million reduction in expenses from salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending. These savings were partially offset by $3 million and $21 million for the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively, of one-time severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease-terminations. Excluding these expenses, selling and administrative expenses declined 9% year-to-date. The Company anticipates incurring approximately $6 million of severance-related and lease termination expenses over the remainder of 2020. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 1% for both the second quarter and first half of 2020. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 22.6% and 26.9% for the second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date, respectively, and 22.2% and 24.0% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. The increase in this percentage is attributable to the decline in sales and the $21 million of one-time severance-related and lease termination costs. 36 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased 15% and 8% in the second quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. These expenses decreased in these periods primarily from the $9 million reduction in expenses from salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending in the second quarter of 2020. Interest Expense, Net The increases in net interest expense in the second quarter and first half of 2020 were primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances and lower interest income on lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of June 27, 2020. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to continue to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the half of 2020 and 2019 by $7 million and $9 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.11 and $0.13, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 and 2019 was 15.4% and 15.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first half of 2020 and 2019 was 13.2% and 12.4%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2020 included a $5 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges and a $2 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points and 1.2 percentage points for the first half of 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2019 included a $3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and a $7 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. These income tax benefits decreased the effective tax rate by 1.0 percentage point and 2.3 percentage points for the first half of 2019, respectively. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 37 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Net income $ 176,491 $ 253,396 Depreciation and amortization 60,203 53,615 Stock-based compensation 18,122 19,255 Deferred income taxes (777 ) 1,632 Change in accounts receivable 86,978 52,508 Change in inventories (27,089 ) (62,200 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities 34,714 (10,439 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 37,558 54,672 Effect of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act — (3,229 ) Other changes (35,754 ) (56,407 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 350,446 302,803 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (192,335 ) 785,063 Net cash used in financing activities (159,366 ) (1,294,734 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 4,576 (1,414 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,321 $ (208,282 ) Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $350 million and $303 million during the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of the $54 million reduction in expense from the cost actions implemented in the second quarter of 2020. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 87 days at June 27, 2020 as compared to 79 days at June 29, 2019. • The changes in inventory were primarily attributable to the reduction in the inventory build plan to adjust inventory levels for lower anticipated sales volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $192 million in the six months ended June 27, 2020 compared to net cash provided by investing activities that totaled $785 million in the six months ended June 29, 2019. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $97 million and $65 million in the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash, investments and debt capacity. The Company incurred $38 million of costs associated with the construction of this facility during the six months ended June 27, 2020. The Company has incurred $123 million on this facility through the end of the second quarter of 2020. Due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily slowed down the completion of the remaining construction and buildout of this facility. 38 Table of Contents During the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, the Company purchased $17 million and $36 million of investments, respectively, while $2 million and $891 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. On January 15, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, for $80 million, net of cash acquired. The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $4 million and included as part of the total consideration. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During the six months ended June 27, 2020, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $15 million while they remained flat during the six months ended June 29, 2019. During the six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company reduced its outstanding debt using cash repatriated under the 2017 Tax Act. As of June 27, 2020, the Company had a total of $1.7 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $960 million in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $740 million borrowed under a term loan under the credit agreement dated November 2017 (“2017 Credit Agreement”). As of June 27, 2020, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1.1 billion after outstanding letters of credit. As of June 27, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. In 2018 and 2019, the Company entered into a total of $560 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the first half of 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased $167 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $9 million and $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. The Company received $15 million and $30 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $356 million as of June 27, 2020. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $288 million held by foreign subsidiaries at June 27, 2020, of which $204 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. While the Company believes it has sufficient levels of cash flow and access to its existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S., we have temporarily suspended our share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management believes, despite the impact of COVID-19 on our business, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 27, 2020 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2020, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the six months ended June 27, 2020. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the six months ended June 27, 2020.

These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including: portions of our global workforce being unable to work fully and/or effectively due to working remotely, illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons related to the pandemic, increased risks of cyber attacks resulting from our temporary remote working model, disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities or to our supply chain, volatility and uncertainty in global capital markets limiting our ability to access capital, customers being unable to make timely payment for purchases and volatility in demand for our products. • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; new or proposed tariffs or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the U.K. voting to exit the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. 41 Table of Contents • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of June 27, 2020, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $288 million out of $356 million and $249 million out of $337 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $204 million out of $356 million and $176 million out of $337 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at June 27, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of June 27, 2020, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of June 27, 2020 would decrease by approximately $18 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ (deficit) equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the six months ended June 27, 2020. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 27, 2020 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the 42 Table of Contents Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 27, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended June 27, 2020 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of June 27, 2020 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K, other than those included below. Note, however, the discussion under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s business has been and may continue to be negatively affected by outbreaks of disease, such as epidemics or pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic . Outbreaks of disease, such as epidemics or pandemics, have and could continue to negatively affect the Company’s business. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. On March 13, 2020, President Trump announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. Since then, COVID-19 has continued to spread throughout the U.S. and globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the Company’s business and could result in a prolonged economic downturn. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including those in the regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries, including the U.S. have implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations. Such measures have had and are expected to continue to have adverse impacts on the U.S. and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration and have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the Company’s operations, including the Company’s sales, supply chain and cash flow. Additionally, the widespread pandemic has caused and is expected to continue to cause significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce the Company’s ability to access capital. The COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if our manufacturing facilities or those of third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. We may also see disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has transitioned the majority of its workforce to a temporary remote working model, which may result in the Company experiencing lower workforce efficiency and productivity, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. 43 Table of Contents As Company employees work from home and access the Company’s system remotely, the Company may be subject to heightened security risks, including the risks of cyber attacks. Additionally, if any of the Company’s key management employees are unable to perform their duties for a period of time, including as the result of illness, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may continue to impact the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial positions, results of operations and cash flows.

Accounting Policies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s first fiscal quarters for 2020 and 2019 ended on March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 25, 2020. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations in customer demand, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, costs of developing new technologies, levels of debt and debt service requirements, risk of disruption, dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of proprietary technology, shifts in taxable income between tax jurisdictions and compliance with regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. On March 13, 2020, President Trump announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which could result in a prolonged economic downturn that has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the Company’s business. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including many of the regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 8 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In the three months ended March 28, 2020 as compared to the three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company experienced a decline in net sales of 10 % due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic uncertainty; however, through the date of the issuance of these financial statements, the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows have not been materially impacted and, thus, the Company concluded that no goodwill or long-lived asset impairment analyses were required. Further, there have been no violations of debt covenants. Any prolonged material disruption of the Company’s employees, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could materially impact its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $ 221 million out of $ 394 million and $ 249 million out of $ 337 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 156 million out of $ 394 million and $ 176 million out of $ 337 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for credit losses as of January 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective transition approach that was applied to the trade receivable balance as of, January 1, 2020. This new accounting guidance required the Company to move from an incurred loss model to a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a net decrease of approximately $ 1 million to the Company’s stockholders’ deficit as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s balance sheets, results of operations or cash flows. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The Company does not consider there to be significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the short-term nature of the balances, the Company having a large and diverse customer base, and the Company having a strong historical experience of collecting receivables with minimal defaults. As a result, credit risk is considered low across territories and trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial asset. The allowance for credit losses is based on a number of factors and is calculated by applying a historical loss rate to trade receivable aging balances to estimate a general reserve balance along with an additional adjustment for any specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery. Past due balances with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant available forward-looking information are included in the specific adjustment. The historical loss rate is reviewed on at least an annual basis and the allowance for credit losses is reviewed quarterly for any required adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. 9 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Trade receivables related to instrument sales are collateralized by the instrument that is sold. If there is a risk of default related to a receivable that is collateralized , then the fair value of the collateral is calculated and adjusted for the cost to re-possess, refurbish and re-sell the instrument. This adjusted fair value is compared to the receivable balance and the difference would be recorded as the expected credit loss. Any recovery of amounts that were written off prior to adoption of the new CECL standard that are received after adoption are recorded in income in the period in which they are received. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in thousands). The March 28, 2020 balance is calculated using the CECL method and the March 30, 2019 balance is calculated using the incurred loss method under legacy GAAP: Balance at Beginning of Period Impact of CECL A doption Additions Deduction Balance at End of Period Allowance for Doubtful Accounts March 28, 2020 $ 9,560 $ 985 $ 3,506 $ ( 1,749 ) $ 12,302 March 30, 2019 $ 7,663 $ — $ 2,159 $ ( 2,324 ) $ 7,498 Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 28, 2020 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Markets Other Significant Total at for Identical Observable Unobservable March 28, Assets Inputs Inputs 2020 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits 3,810 — 3,810 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 29,165 29,165 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 1,028 — 1,028 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 10,007 — 10,007 — Total $ 44,010 $ 29,165 $ 14,845 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,672 $ — $ — $ 2,672 Foreign currency exchange contracts 715 — 715 — Total $ 3,387 $ — $ 715 $ 2,672 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Markets Other Significant Total at for Identical Observable Unobservable December 31, Assets Inputs Inputs 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits 1,642 — 1,642 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 30,158 30,158 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 16 — 16 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 4,485 4,485 Total $ 36,301 $ 30,158 $ 6,143 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,557 $ — $ — $ 2,557 Foreign currency exchange contracts 1,028 — 1,028 — Total $ 3,585 $ — $ 1,028 $ 2,557 Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. 1 1 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the July 2014 acquisition of Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. Although there is no contractual limit, the fair value of future contingent consideration payments was estimated to be $ 3 million at both March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , based on the Company’s best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products, some of which are currently in development, through 2034. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 910 mi llion and $ 1.0 b illion at March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 910 million and $ 1.0 billion at March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. 1 2 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements As of March 28, 2020, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ (deficit) equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): March 28, 2020 December 31, 2019 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 69,627 $ 1,028 $ 119,576 $ 16 Other current liabilities $ 24,000 $ 715 $ 29,495 $ 1,028 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other assets $ 560,000 $ 10,007 $ 560,000 $ 4,485 Accumulated other comprehensive income $ ( 10,007 ) $ ( 4,485 ) The following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized (losses) gains on closed contracts Cost of sales $ ( 2,981 ) $ 525 Unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts Cost of sales 1,325 ( 542 ) Cumulative net pre-tax losses Cost of sales $ ( 1,656 ) $ ( 17 ) Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 3,714 $ 2,227 Unrealized gains on contracts Stockholders’ equity $ 5,522 $ 7,120 Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 0.8 million and 3.3 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 167 million and $ 747 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. As of March 28, 2020, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 11.1 million shares at a cost of $ 2.5 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 1.5 billion authorized for future repurchases. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 9 million and $ 8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively. Whi le t he Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions , t he Company has temporarily suspended share repurchases until there is a more stable and predictable business environment. 1 3 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had $ 20 million of treasury stock purchases that were accrued and unsettled at December 31, 2019. These transactions were settled in January 2020. There were no unsettled treasury stock purchases as of March 28, 2020, while the Company had accrued $ 25 million for such purchases as of March 30, 2019, which settled in the subsequent quarter. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in thousands): Balance at Balance at Beginning Accruals for Settlements End of of Period Warranties Made Period Accrued warranty liability: March 28, 2020 $ 11,964 $ 1,671 $ ( 2,619 ) $ 11,016 March 30, 2019 $ 12,300 $ 1,500 $ ( 2,338 ) $ 11,462 Restructuring In January 2020, the Company made organizational changes to better align its resources with its growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 3 % of the Company’s employees. During the three months ended, the Company incurred $ 18 million of severance-related costs, lease termination costs and other related costs. The Company expects to incur an additional $ 5 million of co s ts for the remainder of the year. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. Revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. In substantially all of the Company’s arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the Company determined control transfers at the point of shipment. In more limited cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site. All incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. In situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the Company’s obligation to ship the products to its customers, the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. Accordingly, such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer. In more rare situations, the Company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. The Company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions and collected by the Company from a customer. Generally, the Company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. The Company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. The Company determines the relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. In developing these estimates, the Company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors. 1 4 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company has sales from standalone software, which are included in instrument systems revenue. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the Company has determined are distinct performance obligations. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. Payment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s revenue streams, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. Prior to providing payment terms to customers, an evaluation of their credit risk is performed. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and, therefore, there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products. Service revenue includes (1) service and software maintenance contracts and (2) service calls (time and materials). Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. The amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period.

The Compa ny had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $ 4 million and inclu ded as part of the total consideration. Andrew Alliance offers lab workflow automation solutions with the combination of its software platform and smart, connected laboratory equipment and accessories. 16 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company has allocated $ 7 million of the purchase price to intangible assets comprised of developed technology, trade name and customer relationships. The developed technology and customer relationships will be amortized over ten years and the trade name will be amortized over 3 years. The Company allocated $ 72 million of the purchase price to goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The principal factor that resulted in recognition of goodwill in the acquisition was that the purchase price was based, in part, on cash flow projections assuming the integration of any acquired technology, distribution channels and products with the Company’s products, which are higher than if the acquired companies’ technology, customer access or products were utilized on a stand-alone basis. The goodwill also includes value assigned to assembled workforce, which cannot be recognized as an intangible asset. In addition, the sellers provided the Company with customary representations, warranties and indemnification, which would be settled in the future if and when a breach of the contractual representation or warranty condition occurs. The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired were determined using various income-approach valuation techniques, which use Level 3 inputs. The following table presents the fair values as of the acquisition date, as determined by the Company, of 100% of the assets and liabilities owned and recorded in connection with the acquisition of Andrew Alliance (in thousands): Cash $ 713 Accounts receivable and current other assets 806 Inventory 669 Prepaid and other assets 611 Property, plant and equipment, net 757 Operating lease assets 847 Intangible assets 6,960 Goodwill 71,632 Total assets acquired 82,995 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,093 Total consideration 80,902 Fair value of minority investment 3,525 Cash consideration paid 77,377 The impact of the Andrew Alliance acquisition on the Company’s revenues and net income during the quarter was immaterial. The pro forma effect on the ongoing operations of the Company as though this acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the periods covered by this report was also immaterial. Our preliminary estimate of the fair value of the specifically identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition is subject to the finalization of management’s analysis. The final determination of these fair values will be completed as additional information becomes available but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The Company expects the final determination of asset and liability fair values to be immaterial to our financial position. 6 Goodwill and Other Intangibles The carrying amount of goodwill was $ 424 million and $ 356 million at March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The acquisition of Andrew Alliance increased goodwill by $ 72 million while the effect of foreign currency translation decreased goodwill by $ 4 million. 1 7 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (dollars in thousands): March 28, 2020 December 31, 2019 Weighted- Weighted- Gross Average Gross Average Carrying Accumulated Amortization Carrying Accumulated Amortization Amount Amortization Period Amount Amortization Period Capitalized software $ 487,894 $ 338,635 5 years $ 481,986 $ 333,255 5 years Purchased intangibles 206,004 152,711 11 years 200,523 151,722 11 years Trademarks and IPR&D 13,477 — — 13,782 — — Licenses 5,346 5,026 6 years 5,669 5,298 6 years Patents and other intangibles 82,041 55,001 8 years 83,035 54,517 8 years Total $ 794,762 $ 551,373 7 years $ 784,995 $ 544,792 7 years The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets decreased by $ 10 million and $ 7 million, respectively, in the three months ended March 28, 2020 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 13 million for both the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 50 million per year for each of the next five years. 7 Debt In November 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $ 1.5 billion revolving facility and a $ 300 million term loan. The revolving facility and term loan both mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a total of $ 960 million and $ 1.1 billion, respectively, of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. 1 8 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. ​​​​​​​ The Company had the following outstanding debt at March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands): March 28, 2020 December 31, 2019 Foreign subsidiary lines of credit $ — $ 366 Senior unsecured notes - Series B - 5.00 %, due February 2020 — 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series E - 3.97 %, due March 2021 50,000 — Total notes payable and debt, current 50,000 100,366 Senior unsecured notes - Series E - 3.97 %, due March 2021 — 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series F - 3.40 %, due June 2021 100,000 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series L - 3.31 %, due September 2026 200,000 200,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series M - 3.53 %, due September 2029 300,000 300,000 Credit agreement 940,000 625,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 4,019 ) ( 4,203 ) Total long-term debt 1,845,981 1,580,797 Total debt $ 1,895,981 $ 1,681,163 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 % . As of March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $ 858 million and $ 1.2 billion , respectively , after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 2.90 % and 3.39 % at March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of March 28, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 105 million at each of March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. The weighted-average interest rate applicable to these short-term borrowings was 1.48 % for December 31, 2019. None of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding short-term borrowings as of March 28, 2020. As of March 28, 2020, the Company had entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 560 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 8 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates we re 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of March 28, 2020. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to continue to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 by $ 2 million and $ 4 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.04 and $ 0.06 , respectively. 19 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 was 7.4 % and 7.1 %, respectively. The income tax provision includes a $ 2 million and $ 7 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 28, 2020 include d a $ 4 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 7.1 percentage points for the three months ended March 28, 2020. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2019 includes a $ 3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 2.9 percentage points for the three months ended March 30, 2019. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax reporting positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those reporting positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in thousands): March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 27,790 $ 26,108 Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period ( 101 ) ( 43 ) Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period 203 325 Balance at the end of the period $ 27,892 $ 26,390 With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2014. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of March 28, 2020, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of less than $ 1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various shareholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. ​​​​​​​ 20 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Cost of sales $ 570 $ 575 Selling and administrative expenses 7,373 8,125 Research and development expenses 1,253 1,241 Total stock-based compensation $ 9,196 $ 9,941 Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 are as follows: Three Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Options issued in thousands 227 136 Risk-free interest rate 1.4 % 2.5 % Expected life in years 6 5 Expected volatility 26.5 % 24.2 % Expected dividends — — Three Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Exercise price $ 216.08 $ 232.08 Fair value $ 61.70 $ 61.97 The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the three months ended March 28, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2019 1,455 $ 61.63 to $ 238.52 $ 158.61 Granted 227 $ 203.37 to $ 235.06 $ 216.08 Exercised ( 81 ) $ 61.63 to $ 208.47 $ 125.76 Canceled ( 55 ) $ 128.93 to $ 208.47 $ 170.12 Outstanding at March 28, 2020 1,546 $ 99.47 to $ 215.62 $ 168.25 2 1 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Restricted Stock During the three months ended March 28, 2020, the Company granted four thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 235.06 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the three months ended March 28, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2019 260 $ 184.70 Granted 105 $ 206.73 Vested ( 85 ) $ 161.44 Forfeited ( 11 ) $ 185.65 Unvested at March 28, 2020 269 $ 200.61 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. Beginning with the 2020 grant, the vesting conditions for performance stock units now include a performance condition based on future sales growth. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 are as follows: Three Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 58 12 Risk-free interest rate 1.3 % 2.4 % Expected life in years 2.9 2.8 Expected volatility 25.1 % 23.5 % Average volatility of peer companies 26.1 % 26.2 % Correlation coefficient 36.6 % 34.2 % Expected dividends — — 2 2 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the three months ended March 28, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2019 105 $ 233.11 Granted 58 $ 190.45 Vested ( 37 ) $ 184.51 Forfeited ( 3 ) $ 281.39 Unvested at March 28, 2020 123 $ 226.44 10 Earnings Per Shar e Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 53,562 62,232 $ 0.86 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 394 — Net income per diluted common share $ 53,562 62,626 $ 0.86 Three Months Ended March 30, 2019 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 108,986 71,704 $ 1.52 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 711 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 108,986 72,415 $ 1.51 For the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, the Company had 0.2 million and 0.1 million stock options that were antidilutive, respectively, due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 11 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are detailed as follows (in thousands): Currency Translation Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Retirement Plans Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 104,066 ) $ ( 15,405 ) $ ( 119,471 ) Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax ( 19,344 ) 398 ( 18,946 ) Balance at March 28, 2020 $ ( 123,410 ) $ ( 15,007 ) $ ( 138,417 ) 12 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. 2 4 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as follows for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Product net sales: Waters instrument systems $ 142,829 $ 184,612 Chemistry consumables 97,245 99,253 TA instrument systems 34,109 36,638 Total product sales 274,183 320,503 Service net sales: Waters service 174,137 176,049 TA service 16,619 17,310 Total service sales 190,756 193,359 Total net sales $ 464,939 $ 513,862 Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

Current guidance requires the recognition of a credit loss when it is considered probable that a loss event has occurred. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and non-credit components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted this new standard using a modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost which only impacted the Company’s allowance on trade accounts receivable. The Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet credit exposures which would be impacted by the new guidance. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under the new standard while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a net decrease of $ 1 million to stockholders’ deficit as of January 1, 2020 for the cumulative effect of adopting the new standard due to converting to the current expected credit loss model for the allowance recorded against trade accounts receivables. This accounting standard did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 2 6 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of retirement benefit plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2019, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions within the current guidance, including the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendment also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance related to aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2020, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting guidance for equity method investments, joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The update clarifies the interaction between different sections of the accounting guidance that could be applicable and helps clarify which guidance should be applied in certain situations which should increase relevance and comparability of financial statement information. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In March 2020, accounting guidance was issued that facilitates the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the update provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. This temporary guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company may elect to apply this guidance for all contract modifications or eligible hedging relationships during that time period subject to certain criteria. The Company is still evaluating the impact of reference rate reform and whether this guidance will be adopted. In March 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the coronavirus outbreak which, among other things, contains numerous income tax provisions. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act, it does not currently believe it will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. 2 7 Table of Contents Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The Company is actively managing its business to respond to the COVID-19 impact; however, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows in the future. To date the COVID-19 pandemic has not impacted our manufacturing facilities or our third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers. We have also not seen disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. At every stage of the pandemic, we have taken decisive and appropriate cautions, including a mandatory remote work policy for all employees with the exception of manufacturing, distribution, and certain laboratory environments, as well as bans on non-essential travel and visitors into our facilities. Early on, we engaged a Medical Advisor to guide our policy deployment, and we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health of our global employee base, and the safety of all customer interactions. The vast majority of the markets we serve, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, food/environmental and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels, and we are working closely with these customers to ensure their seamless operation. Over the last several years, Waters has executed on a digital workplace strategy focused on providing modern connectivity and collaboration tools to our employees. Our strategic technology investments have enabled us to swiftly meet remote working needs as this situation has escalated. From a customer-facing perspective, we are leveraging digital demand generation activities, including virtual demos across all regions, remote instrument installations, virtual sales seminars, online product training, and a rapid acceleration in one-on-one communications over emails, phone and video conferencing. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be fluid and near-term challenges across the economy remain. The Company is taking a proactive approach to managing through this unpredictability and the Company has implemented a series of cost reduction actions that include salary reductions, furloughs and reductions in non-essential spending and other working capital reductions in order to preserve liquidity and enhance financial flexibility. 28 Table of Contents The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 274,183 $ 320,503 (14 %) Service sales 190,756 193,359 (1 %) Total net sales 464,939 513,862 (10 %) Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 210,644 221,031 (5 %) Selling and administrative expenses 147,735 134,339 10 % Research and development expenses 34,989 35,060 — Purchased intangibles amortization 2,625 2,281 15 % Litigation settlement 666 — — Operating income 68,280 121,151 (44 %) Operating income as a % of sales 14.7 % 23.6 % Other expense (374 ) (525 ) 29 % Interest expense, net (10,043 ) (3,248 ) 209 % Income before income taxes 57,863 117,378 (51 %) Provision for income taxes 4,301 8,392 (49 %) Net income $ 53,562 $ 108,986 (51 %) Net income per diluted common share $ 0.86 $ 1.51 (43 %) In the first quarter of 2020, the Company’s net sales decreased 10% as compared to the first quarter of 2019, as a result of weaker demand for our products and services by our customers due in large part to the disruption and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation decreased sales by 2%. This decline in sales was primarily driven by the 48% decline in the first quarter of 2020 of sales in China where the COVID-19 pandemic first arose. Excluding China, the Company’s sales declined 1%, with foreign currency translation negatively impacting sales growth by 1%. We anticipate that the impact on our quarterly results will be more significant beginning in the second quarter of 2020 as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the globe. Unless otherwise noted, sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared with the same period in the prior year. Instrument system sales decreased 20% in the quarter, as a result of weaker demand for our products by our customers due to the interruption of business activities and the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales by 1%. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) decreased 2% in the quarter. In the first quarter of 2020, recurring revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 2% as well as one less calendar day as compared to the first quarter of 2019. Geographically, the Company’s sales decreased 21% in Asia, 5% in the Americas, and increased 2% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacting sales growth in both Asia and Europe by 2% during the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, China sales declined 48%, primarily as a result of weaker demand and disruption to business activities caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns. Foreign currency translation decreased China sales growth by 2% in the quarter. Sales in the U.S. decreased 4%, were flat in Asia Other, and increased 4% in Japan. Foreign currency translation decreased Asia Other’s sales growth by 2% and increased Japan’s sales by 2% in the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, sales to pharmaceutical customers declined 7%, primarily due to the disruption in business activities caused by COVID-19, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1%. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, declined 8%, primarily due to a 6% decline in TA sales and the lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1%. During the first quarter of 2020, combined sales to academic and governmental customers decreased 24%, as governmental customers adjusted their spending to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign currency translation decreased academic and governmental sales growth by 2%. Sales to our governmental and academic customers are highly dependent on when institutions receive funding to purchase our instrument systems and, as such, sales can vary significantly from period to period. Operating income was $68 million in the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 44% as compared to the first quarter of 2019. This decrease in the quarter was primarily a result of the decline in sales volumes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating income in the first quarter of 2020 also included $18 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination costs. 29 Table of Contents The Company generated $152 million and $176 million of net cash flows from operations in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $51 million and $26 million in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In January of 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, S.A. and its two operating subsidiaries, Andrew Alliance USA, Inc. and Andrew Alliance France, SASU, (collectively “Andrew Alliance”), for $80 million, net of cash acquired. The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $4 million and included as part of the total consideration. This acquisition is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s sales and expenses. The first quarter of 2020 includes $21 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $106 million on this facility through the end of the first quarter of 2020 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. Due to the uncertain business conditions caused the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company currently plans to temporarily slow down the completion of the remaining construction and buildout of this facility. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the first quarters of 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased $167 million and $747 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. While the Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits, the Company suspended its share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 % change Net Sales: Asia: China $ 47,231 $ 90,091 (48 %) Japan 45,089 43,504 4 % Asia Other 66,760 66,917 — Total Asia 159,080 200,512 (21 %) Americas: United States 143,898 149,157 (4 %) Americas Other 28,278 32,711 (14 %) Total Americas 172,176 181,868 (5 %) Europe 133,683 131,482 2 % Total net sales $ 464,939 $ 513,862 (10 %) In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted businesses throughout the world and, while it was a significant headwind on the Company’s overall business, the greatest impact was in China, where sales declined 48% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in sales in Japan for the first quarter was driven by service revenues and sales to pharmaceutical and academic and governmental customers. Sales in Asia Other were driven by TA products and services, despite a 2% decrease due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Sales declines in the U.S. and the rest of the Americas were broad-based across all major product and customer classes primarily due the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly towards the end of the quarter as more regions throughout the world placed business restrictions on companies. Sales growth in Europe was primarily driven by sales to pharmaceutical and industrial customers, despite a 2% decrease due to the effect of foreign currency translation for the quarter. 30 Table of Contents Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 % change Pharmaceutical $ 272,563 $ 294,512 (7 %) Industrial 143,354 155,218 (8 %) Academic and governmental 49,022 64,132 (24 %) Total net sales $ 464,939 $ 513,862 (10 %) In the first quarter of 2020, the decline in sales to pharmaceutical customers was primarily due to the disruption in business activities caused by COVID-19, despite demand for our products and services from certain pharmaceutical customers involved with COVID-19 diagnostic testing and the development of new drugs and therapies increasing. Foreign currency translation decreased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 1%. The decline in sales to industrial customers in the quarter is primarily due to a 6% decline in TA sales and the lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in sales to academic and governmental customers was broad-based across all product classes as governmental customers adjusted their spending to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services are as follows for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 % of Total March 30, 2019 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 142,829 34 % $ 184,612 40 % (23 %) Chemistry consumables 97,245 24 % 99,253 22 % (2 %) Total Waters product sales 240,074 58 % 283,865 62 % (15 %) Waters service 174,137 42 % 176,049 38 % (1 %) Total Waters net sales $ 414,211 100 % $ 459,914 100 % (10 %) The effect of foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales by 1% for the quarter. Precision chemistry consumables sales decreased in the first quarter of 2020 as the demand for chemistry consumables declined 16% in China, while demand in Europe, Japan, and Latin America increased on the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits to pharmaceutical customers. Waters service sales decreased due to lower service demand billings due to COVID-19 business closures and lockdowns, particularly in China and India. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by one less calendar day and the negative impact of foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 1% in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2019. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) decreased in all geographical regions except Europe, Japan, and India, primarily due to lower sales as a result of weaker demand for our products and services by our customers due to the disruption and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2020, Waters sales increased 2% in Europe and 6% in Japan where instruments, chemistry and service all grew. Waters sales decreased 50% in China due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Waters sales in Europe and China were negatively impacted by 3% and 2%, respectively, due to the effect of foreign currency translation, and Japan’s sales growth benefited by 2% from foreign currency translation. 31 Table of Contents TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services are as follows for the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 % of Total March 30, 2019 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 34,109 67 % $ 36,638 68 % (7 %) TA service 16,619 33 % 17,310 32 % (4 %) Total TA net sales $ 50,728 100 % $ 53,948 100 % (6 %) The decline in TA instrument system sales of 7% and TA service sales of 4% in the first quarter of 2020 was primarily due to lower customer demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased TA’s sales 2% in the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, TA sales declined in all major regions of the world due to the impact from COVID-19. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the first quarter of 2020 decreased 5% primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and a change in sales mix. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to negatively impact gross profit for the remainder of 2020. To date the Company has not had significant issues with its supply chain; however, the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on businesses could negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to deliver goods to us, as well as possibly increase the cost of those goods used in our manufacturing operations. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 10% in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, selling and administrative expenses were impacted by higher merit compensation costs and $18 million of one-time severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce and lease termination costs. Excluding this expense, selling and administrative expenses declined 3%. The Company anticipates incurring approximately $5 million of severance-related and lease termination expenses over the remainder of 2020. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation reduced selling and administrative expenses by 1% in the first quarter of 2020. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 31.8% and 26.1% for the first quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in this percentage is attributable to the decline in sales and the $18 million of one-time severance-related and lease termination costs. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were flat in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased research and development expenses by 1% in the quarter. Interest Expense, Net The increase in net interest expense in the first quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances and lower interest income on lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, being somewhat offset by the additional interest income from the U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements. 32 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of March 28, 2020. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to continue to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the quarter in 2020 and 2019 by $2 million and $4 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.04 and $0.06, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the 2020 and 2019 quarters was 7.4% and 7.1%, respectively. The income tax provision included a $2 million and $7 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for the 2020 quarter included a $4 million income tax benefit related to certain restructuring charges. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 7.1 percentage points for the 2020 quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2019 quarter includes a $3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 2.9 percentage points for the 2019 quarter. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Net income $ 53,562 $ 108,986 Depreciation and amortization 29,188 24,764 Stock-based compensation 9,196 9,941 Deferred income taxes (2,525 ) 1,442 Change in accounts receivable 54,026 59,331 Change in inventories (29,399 ) (44,438 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (15,825 ) (33,485 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 46,465 57,539 Effect of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act — (3,229 ) Other changes 6,947 (5,072 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 151,635 175,779 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (130,175 ) 434,039 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 32,918 (723,134 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (32 ) 2,006 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 54,346 $ (111,310 ) Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $152 million and $176 million during the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 99 days at March 28, 2020 as compared to 88 days at March 30, 2019. • The changes in inventory were primarily attributable to the lower than anticipated sales volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $130 million in the three months ended March 28, 2020 compared to net cash provided by investing activities that totaled $434 million in the three months ended March 30, 2019. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $51 million and $26 million in the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash, investments and debt capacity. The Company incurred $21 million of costs associated with the construction of this facility during the three months ended March 28, 2020. The Company has incurred $106 million on this Facility through the end of the first quarter of 2020. Due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company currently plans to temporarily slow down the completions of the remaining construction and buildout of this Facility.” 34 Table of Contents During the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, the Company purchased $4 million and $27 million of investments, respectively, while $1 million and $486 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. On January 15, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Andrew Alliance, for $80 million, net of cash acquired. The Company had an equity investment in Andrew Alliance that was valued at $4 million and included as part of the total consideration. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During the three months ended March 28, 2020, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $215 million while they remained flat during the three months ended March 30, 2019. During the three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company reduced its outstanding debt using cash repatriated under the 2017 Tax Act. As of March 28, 2020, the Company had a total of $1.9 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $960 million in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $940 million borrowed under a term loan under the credit agreement dated November 2017 (“2017 Credit Agreement”). As of March 28, 2020, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $858 million after outstanding letters of credit. As of March 28, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. In 2018 and 2019, the Company entered into a total of $560 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased $167 million and $747 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $9 million and $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively. The Company received $12 million and $28 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the three months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $394 million as of March 28, 2020. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $221 million held by foreign subsidiaries at March 28, 2020, of which $156 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. While the Company believes it has sufficient levels of cash flow and access to its existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S., we currently plan to suspend our share repurchases due to the uncertain business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management believes, despite the impact of COVID-19 on our business, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. 35 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 28, 2020 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2020, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation and business combinations and asset acquisitions. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the three months ended March 28, 2020. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the three months ended March 28, 2020. New Accounting Pronouncements Please refer to Note 14, Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments, in the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the information incorporated by reference herein, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to future results and events, including any statements regarding, among other items, anticipated trends or growth in the Company’s business, including, but not limited to, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of new or proposed tariff or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the impact of foreign currency translation on financial results; development of products by acquired businesses; the growth rate of sales and research and development expenses; the impact of costs associated with developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market; the impact of new product launches and the associated costs, such as the amortization expense related to software platforms; geographic sales mix of business; development of products by acquired businesses and the amount of contingent payments to the sellers of an acquired business; anticipated expenses, including interest expense, capitalized software costs and effective tax rates; the impact of the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; the impact and outcome of the Company’s various ongoing tax audit examinations; the achievement of contractual milestones to preserve foreign tax rates; the impact and outcome of litigation matters; the impact of the loss of intellectual property protection; the impact of new accounting standards and pronouncements; the adequacy of the Company’s supply chain and manufacturing capabilities and facilities; the impact of regulatory compliance; the Company’s expected cash flow, borrowing capacity, debt repayment and refinancing; the Company’s ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, service debt, repay outstanding lines of credit, make authorized share repurchases, fund potential acquisitions and pay any adverse litigation or tax audit liabilities, particularly in the U.S.; future impairment charges; the Company’s contributions to defined benefit plans; the Company’s expectations regarding changes to its financial position; compliance with applicable environmental laws; and the impact of recent acquisitions on sales and earnings. Many of these statements appear, in particular, under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of the words “feels”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “expects”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “intends”, “suggests”, “appears”, “estimates”, “projects”, “should” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including: portions of our global workforce being unable to work fully and/or effectively due to working remotely, illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons related to the pandemic, increased risks of cyber attacks resulting from our temporary remote working model, disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities or to our supply chain, volatility and uncertainty in global capital markets limiting our ability to access capital, customers being unable to make timely payment for purchases and volatility in demand for our products. • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic; new or proposed tariffs or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the U.K. voting to exit the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. 37 Table of Contents • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of March 28, 2020, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $221 million out of $394 million and $249 million out of $337 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $156 million out of $394 million and $176 million out of $337 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of March 28, 2020, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of March 28, 2020 would decrease by approximately $18 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ (deficit) equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the three months ended March 28, 2020. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 28, 2020 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the 38 Table of Contents Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 28, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended March 28, 2020 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of March 28, 2020 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K, other than those included below. Note, however, the discussion under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s business has been and may continue to be negatively affected by outbreaks of disease, such as epidemics or pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic . Outbreaks of disease, such as epidemics or pandemics, could negatively affect the Company’s business. Both the Company’s domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. On March 13, 2020, President Trump announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the Company’s business and could result in a prolonged economic downturn. The Company operates in over 35 countries, including many of the regions most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries including the United States have implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations. Such measures have had and are expected to continue to have adverse impacts on the U.S. and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration and have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the Company’s operations, including the Company’s sales and supply chain. Additionally, the widespread pandemic has caused and is expected to continue to cause significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce the Company’s ability to access capital and cash flow. The COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if our manufacturing facilities or those of third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. We may also see disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, the Company has transitioned the majority of its workforce to a temporary remote working model, which may result in the Company experiencing lower work efficiency and productivity, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s business. As Company employees work from home and access the Company’s system remotely, the Company may be subject to heightened security risks, including the risks of cyber attacks. Additionally, if any of the Company’s key management employees are unable to perform their duties for a period of time, including as the result of illness, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. 39 Table of Contents The Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, or the extent to which the disruption may continue to impact the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial positions, results of operations and cash flows.

Policies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s third fiscal quarters for 2019 and 2018 ended on September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“ U.S. GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 1, 2019. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. 10 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $ 303 million out of $ 405 million and $ 471 million out of $ 1,735 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 235 million out of $ 405 million and $ 251 million out of $ 1,735 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including historical experience and the customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged against the allowance when the Company determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Additions Deduction Balance at End of Period Allowance for Doubtful Accounts September 28, 2019 $ 7,663 $ 6,014 $ ( 5,461 ) $ 8,216 September 29, 2018 $ 6,109 $ 2,752 $ ( 2,175 ) $ 6,686 Other Investments During the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company made investments in unaffiliated companies of $ 7 million and $ 8 million, respectively. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 11 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 28, 2019 (in thousands): Total at September 28, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Time deposits 213 — 213 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 32,796 32,796 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 66 — 66 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 16,945 — 16,945 — Total $ 50,020 $ 32,796 $ 17,224 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,822 $ — $ — $ 2,822 Foreign currency exchange contracts 826 — 826 — Total $ 3,648 $ — $ 826 $ 2,822 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Total at December 31, 2018 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 164,315 $ — $ 164,315 $ — Foreign government securities 3,463 — 3,463 — Corporate debt securities 723,059 — 723,059 — Time deposits 108,638 — 108,638 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 33,104 33,104 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 503 — 503 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 1,093 1,093 Total $ 1,034,175 $ 33,104 $ 1,001,071 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,476 $ — $ — $ 2,476 Foreign currency exchange contracts 224 — 224 — Total $ 2,700 $ — $ 224 $ 2,476 12 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the July 2014 acquisition of Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. Although there is no contractual limit, the fair value of future contingent consideration payments was estimated to be $3 million and $2 million at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, based on the Company’s best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products, some of which are currently in development, through 2034. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 1.0 billion and $ 510 million at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 1.0 b illion and $ 502 million at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. 13 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements In 2018, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. In 2019, the Company entered into additional interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 110 million and contract terms between one and three years. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): September 28, 2019 December 31, 2018 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 24,000 $ 66 $ 112,212 $ 503 Other current liabilities $ 121,580 $ 826 $ 40,175 $ 224 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other assets $ 410,000 $ 16,945 $ 300,000 $ 1,093 Accumulated other comprehensive income $ 16,945 $ 1,093 The following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts (in thousands): Financial Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Statement Classification September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized losses on closed contracts Cost of sales $ ( 3,340 ) $ ( 23 ) $ ( 5,858 ) $ ( 2,158 ) Unrealized losses on open contracts Cost of sales ( 633 ) ( 5 ) ( 1,040 ) ( 1,092 ) Cumulative net pre-tax losses Cost of sales $ ( 3,973 ) $ ( 28 ) $ ( 6,898 ) $ ( 3,250 ) Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 2,698 $ 927 $ 7,848 $ 927 Unrealized gains on open contracts Stockholders’ equity $ 15,847 $ 767 $ 15,852 $ 767 14 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company repurchased 8.6 million and 4.1 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 1.9 billion and $ 809 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 7.8 million shares at a cost of $ 1.7 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 2.3 billion authorized for future repurchases. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 8 million and $ 9 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions. As of September 28, 2019, the Company accrued $18 million as a result of treasury stock purchases that were settled in the fourth quarter of 2019. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in thousands): Balance at Beginning of Period Accruals for Warranties Settlements Made Balance at End of Period Accrued warranty liability: September 28, 2019 $ 12,300 $ 5,271 $ ( 6,094 ) $ 11,477 September 29, 2018 $ 13,026 $ 6,068 $ ( 6,901 ) $ 12,193 Restructuring and Other Charges In January 2019, the Company made organizational changes to better align our resources with our growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 1 % of the Company’s employees. Severance an d related costs to the Company were immaterial and $ 9 million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019, respectively. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. Revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. In substantially all of the Company’s arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the Company determined control transfers at the point of shipment. In more limited cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site. All incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of 15 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) sales. In situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the Company’s obligation to ship the products to its customers, the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. Accordingly, such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer. In more rare situations, the Company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. The Company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions and collected by the Company from a customer. Generally, the Company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. The Company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. The Company determines relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. In developing these estimates, the Company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors. The Company has sales from standalone software, which is included in instrument systems revenue. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the Company has determined are distinct performance obligations. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. Payment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s revenue streams, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. Prior to providing payment terms to customers, an evaluation of the customer’s credit risk is performed. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and, therefore, there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products. Service revenue includes (1) service and software maintenance contracts and (2) service calls (time and materials). Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. The amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in thousands): September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 204,257 $ 192,590 Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period ( 174,929 ) ( 147,310 ) Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 206,093 179,571 Balance at the end of the period $ 235,421 $ 224,851 The Company classified $ 38 million and $ 39 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 1 6 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The amount of deferred revenue and customer advances equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period presented.

Interest on the Series L and M Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. The Company may prepay some or all of the Senior Notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount for Series L and M Senior Notes, in each case, upon no more than 60 nor less than 30 days’ written notice to the holders of the Senior Notes. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement ) of the Company, the Company may be required to prepay the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Other provisions for these senior unsecured notes are similar to the existing senior unsecured notes, as described below. In November 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $ 1.5 billion revolving facility and a $ 300 million term loan. The revolving facility and term loan both mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had a total o f $ 1.1 billion and $ 560 million , respectively, of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for the Series H senior unsecured note. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. 19 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In 2018, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. In 2019, the Company entered into additional interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 110 million and contract terms between one and three years . See Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” 2 0 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had the following outstanding debt at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (in thousands): September 28, 2019 December 31, 2018 Foreign subsidiary lines of credit $ 58 $ 178 Senior unsecured notes - Series B - 5.00%, due February 2020 100,000 — Total notes payable and debt, current 100,058 178 Senior unsecured notes - Series B - 5.00 %, due February 2020 — 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series E - 3.97 %, due March 2021 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series F - 3.40 %, due June 2021 100,000 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series L - 3.31%, due September 2026 200,000 — Senior unsecured notes - Series M - 3.53%, due September 2029 300,000 — Credit agreement 300,000 590,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 4,399 ) ( 1,828 ) Total long-term debt 1,255,601 1,148,172 Total debt $ 1,355,659 $ 1,148,350 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of both September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $ 1.5 b illion after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 3.62 % and 3.83 % at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of September 28, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 105 million and $ 90 million at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to these short-term borrowings were 1.48 % and 1.88 % for September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates we re 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of September 28, 2019. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 by $ 15 million and $ 21 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.21 and $ 0.26 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 was 16.1 % and 16.7 %, respectively. The de crease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to a $ 2 million expense in the three months ended September 29, 2018 related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “ 2017 Tax Act ”) . This increase in income tax expense in creased the effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points for the three months ended September 29, 2018. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 2 1 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 was 13.7 % and 15.6 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 includes a $ 3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the 2017 Tax Act . This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 0.7 percentage points for the nine months ended September 28, 2019. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 includes $ 6 million of additional income tax expense related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act. This additional income tax expense increased the effective tax rate by 1.3 percentage points for the nine months ended September 29, 2018. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s uncertain tax positions for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in thousands): September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 26,108 $ 5,843 Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period ( 173 ) ( 189 ) Net additions for tax positions taken during the prior period — 18,608 Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period 1,314 678 Balance at the end of the period $ 27,249 $ 24,940 With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2013. However, carryforward tax attributes that were generated in years beginning on or before January 1, 2014 may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if the attributes are utilized in open years . The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of September 28, 2019, the Company expects to record reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of less than $ 1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Leases The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach that was applied to leases existing as of, or entered into after, January 1, 2019. The Company elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward historical assessments of (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a right-of-use lease asset and lease liabilities in the amount $ 100 million as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and retained earnings. 2 2 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Prior to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, undiscounted future minimum rents payable as of December 31, 2018 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year were as follows (in thousands): 2019 $ 28,417 2020 23,424 2021 16,032 2022 11,816 2023 and thereafter 23,269 Total future minimum lease payments $ 102,958 The Company’s operating leases consist of property leases for sales, demonstration, laboratory, warehouse and office spaces, automotive leases for sales and service personnel and equipment leases, primarily used in our manufacturing and distribution operations. The lease policies described below were effective as of January 1, 2019. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company recorded the related right-of-use asset and lease liability obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term of the leases. Some of the Company’s leases include rental escalation clauses, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into our determination of lease payments. A certain number of these leases contain rent escalation clauses, either fixed or adjusted periodically for inflation of market rates, that are factored into the Company’s determination of lease payments. The Company also has variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, primarily for items such as common area maintenance and real estate taxes, which are recorded as variable costs when incurred. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements that contain lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component. The Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements of the new accounting guidance to leases with terms less than 12 months. For these leases, the Company recognizes lease payments in net income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. As of September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company does not have leases that are classified as finance leases. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to determine the present value of the lease liabilities; however, most of the leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate and, as required by the accounting guidance, the Company estimated its incremental secured borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement (or, for the leases in existence on the adoption date, the January 1, 2019 information). The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the estimated rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As of September 28, 2019, the Company has lease agreements that expire at various dates through 203 4 , with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 4.7 years. Rental expense was $ 9 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 under the new lease accounting standard and $ 8 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 under the previous lease accounting standard. Rental expense was $ 27 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 under the new lease accounting standard and $ 23 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 under the previous lease accounting standard. As of September 28, 2019, the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of lease liabilities was 3.95 %. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities in operating activities in the statement of cash flows was $ 27 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2019. 23 Table of Contents CONDENSED N OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification September 28, 2019 Assets: Property operating lease assets Operating lease assets $ 57,028 Automobile operating lease assets Operating lease assets 26,122 Equipment operating lease assets Operating lease assets 1,962 Total lease assets $ 85,112 Liabilities: Current operating lease liabilities Current operating lease liabilities $ 23,936 Long-term operating lease liabilities Long-term operating lease liabilities 61,372 Total lease liabilities $ 85,308 24 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Undiscounted future minimum rents payable as of September 28, 2019 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year reconcile to lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet as follows (in thousands): 2019 (remaining 3 months) $ 6,600 2020 22,727 2021 15,418 2022 8,538 2023 5,931 2024 and thereafter 38,482 Total future minimum lease payments 97,696 Less: amount of lease payments representing interest ( 12,388 ) Present value of future minimum lease payments 85,308 Less: current operating lease liabilities ( 23,936 ) Long-term operating lease liabilities $ 61,372 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various shareholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Cost of sales $ 531 $ 488 $ 1,673 $ 1,696 Selling and administrative expenses 7,766 6,731 23,293 22,855 Research and development expenses 1,365 1,994 3,951 3,633 Total stock-based compensation $ 9,662 $ 9,213 $ 28,917 $ 28,184 25 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 are as follows: Nine Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Options issued in thousands 139 147 Risk-free interest rate 2.5 % 2.7 % Expected life in years 5 6 Expected volatility 24.3 % 23.2 % Expected dividends — — Nine Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Exercise price $ 231.30 $ 205.37 Fair value $ 61.85 $ 57.99 The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2018 1,790 $ 38.09 to $ 208.47 $ 142.47 Granted 139 $ 183.41 to $ 238.52 $ 231.30 Exercised ( 256 ) $ 38.09 to $ 208.47 $ 111.11 Canceled ( 74 ) $ 113.36 to $ 238.52 $ 159.17 Outstanding at September 28, 2019 1,599 $ 38.09 to $ 238.52 $ 154.44 Restricted Stock During the nine months ended September 28, 2019, the Company granted five thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 183.41 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2018 304 $ 153.31 Granted 84 $ 235.95 Vested ( 104 ) $ 138.95 Forfeited ( 23 ) $ 168.73 Unvested at September 28, 2019 261 $ 184.27 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. 26 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.

This new comprehensive lease standard amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases. The core principle of the new guidance requires lessees to present the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on their balance sheets. This guidance was effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company has adopted this standard using a modified retrospective transition approach to be applied to leases existing as of, or entered into after, January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the Company’s balance sheet by recording a right-of-use lease asset and lease liabilities in the amount $ 100 million as of January 1, 2019; however, it did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and retained earnings. In March 2017, accounting guidance was issued to amend the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amortization period for certain callable debt securities was shortened to end at the earliest call date. This guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2018, accounting guidance was issued to address the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Current accounting guidance requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates with the effect recorded in income from continuing operations, even if the related tax effects were originally recognized in other comprehensive income, the new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. This guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued to address the capitalization of implementation costs associated with hosting arrangements that meet the definition of a service contract. The new guidance clarified that the internal-use software capitalization guidance should be used to determine when implementation costs are capitalizable. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to prospectively adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the recognition of credit losses related to financial assets, such as debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and other financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash. Current guidance requires the recognition of a credit loss when it is considered probable that a loss event has occurred. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and non-credit components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company currently does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company currently does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 32 Table of Contents CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of retirement benefit plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 33 Table of Contents Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 % change September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 370,573 $ 378,522 (2 %) $ 1,078,341 $ 1,106,508 (3 %) Service sales 206,705 199,499 4 % 611,961 598,402 2 % Total net sales 577,278 578,021 — 1,690,302 1,704,910 (1 %) Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 241,055 241,139 — 711,632 705,695 1 % Selling and administrative expenses 126,036 126,997 (1 %) 393,583 394,049 — Research and development expenses 34,333 35,173 (2 %) 105,883 105,297 1 % Purchased intangibles amortization 2,619 2,114 24 % 7,164 5,375 33 % Litigation provision (settlement) — 924 (100 %) — (748 ) 100 % Operating income 173,235 171,674 1 % 472,040 495,242 (5 %) Operating income as a % of sales 30.0 % 29.7 % 27.9 % 29.0 % Other expense (496 ) (811 ) (39 %) (1,363 ) (2,293 ) (41 %) Interest expense, net (8,001 ) (1,633 ) 390 % (16,826 ) (8,609 ) 95 % Income before income taxes 164,738 169,230 (3 %) 453,851 484,340 (6 %) Provision for income taxes 26,605 28,216 (6 %) 62,322 75,698 (18 %) Net income $ 138,133 $ 141,014 (2 %) $ 391,529 $ 408,642 (4 %) Net income per diluted common share $ 2.07 $ 1.83 13 % $ 5.63 $ 5.21 8 % The Company’s sales were flat for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the third quarter of 2018 and decreased 1% for the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the first nine months of 2018. Foreign currency translation decreased sales growth by 1% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared with the same period in the prior year. Instrument system sales decreased 4% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 as a result of the weaker demand for our products by our customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions and governmental policy changes in certain regions. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales by 1% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 4% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, recurring revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation which lowered sales growth by 1% and 2%, respectively, as well as one less calendar day as compared to the first nine months of 2018. 34 Table of Contents In the third quarter of 2019, the Company’s sales increased 7% in Asia and decreased 5% in the Americas and 4% in Europe. For the first nine months of 2019, the Company’s sales were flat in the Americas, increased 3% in Asia and decreased 7% in Europe. Foreign currency translation decreased Asia’s sales growth by 1% in the first nine months of 2019 and decreased Europe’s sales growth by 4% and 5% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Sales in the Americas were impacted by sales in the U.S. which decreased 4% for the third quarter and increased 2% for the first nine months of 2019. The softer U.S. sales growth can be attributed to a decrease in capital spending on our instrument systems by our pharmaceutical customers, which was partially offset by sales to our industrial customers in the U.S., which grew 5% and 7% during the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2019, respectively. Sales in the Americas were also negatively impacted by declines in Latin America of 18% and 15% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, driven by political instability in both Mexico and Brazil. The sales growth in Asia was driven by sales growth in Japan of 8% and 5% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing Japan’s sales growth by 5% and 1%, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. Asia sales growth was also impacted by India as sales increased by 4% for the third quarter and decreased by 2% for the first nine months of 2019, primarily due to continued strength in the pharmaceutical market, partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation which negatively impacted India’s sales growth by 2% and 7%, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. China sales increased 2% in the third quarter and were flat for the first nine months of 2019, due to economic uncertainty stemming from governmental policy in our food and pharmaceutical markets. Sales in Europe were impacted by weak demand in Western Europe caused by the political uncertainties of Brexit and the effect of foreign currency translation, which reduced the sales growth rate by 4% and 5% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 1% for the third quarter of 2019 and were flat for the first nine months of 2019, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 2% and 3% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Sales to pharmaceutical customers were driven by an increasing need for global access to prescription drugs and testing of newer and more complex biologic drugs. Thus far in 2019, the pharmaceutical sales growth has come in Asia, where sales grew 12% in the third quarter and 8% for the first nine months, with this sales growth being negatively impacted by declines in sales in all other areas of the world due to macroeconomic conditions and political uncertainties. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, were flat in the third quarter and declined 3% for the first nine months of 2019, with the effect of foreign currency translation having no impact on the third quarter sales, but decreasing sales growth by 1% for the first nine months of 2019. Sales to our industrial customers have been negatively impacted by lower customer demand for our LC, MS and TA instrument systems outside the U.S. Combined sales to academic and governmental customers decreased 4% and 2% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, primarily due to the timing of the release of funds by governments and the negative effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales growth by 1% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Operating income increased 1% for the third quarter of 2019 and decreased 5% for the first nine months of 2019. The increase in operating income in the third quarter of 2019 can be attributed to lower variable incentive compensation expenses. The decrease in operating income for the first nine months of 2019 can be attributed to lower sales volume and $9 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce that occurred in early 2019. Net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019 was $2.07 up 13% compared to the prior year. Net income per diluted share for the first nine months of 2019 was $5.63 up 8% compared to the prior year. The increase in the net income per diluted share is attributed to the effect of the Company’s ongoing share repurchase program as the net income for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 has declined as a result of the slightly lower sales and the increase in the net interest expense as a result of the Company moving to its optimal net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 2.5 times. The Company generated $451 million and $423 million of net cash flows from operations in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of a $15 million litigation settlement payment in 2018 that did not recur. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $110 million and $64 million in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The first nine months of 2019 include $48 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision 35 Table of Contents chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $66 million on this facility through the end of the first nine months of 2019 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. During the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, the Company made $7 million and $8 million of investments in unaffiliated companies, respectively. In September 2019, the Company issued fixed rate senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal of $500 million, of which $200 million of the outstanding notes matures in 7 years and $300 million of the outstanding notes matures in 10 years. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased $1.9 billion and $809 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits. Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 % change September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 % change Net Sales: Asia: China $ 111,657 $ 109,713 2 % $ 314,544 $ 313,250 — Japan 46,840 43,549 8 % 136,302 129,497 5 % Asia Other 79,278 68,934 15 % 226,276 216,634 4 % Total Asia 237,775 222,196 7 % 677,122 659,381 3 % Americas: United States 164,164 170,766 (4 %) 487,261 479,072 2 % Americas Other 32,294 36,037 (10 %) 97,840 107,567 (9 %) Total Americas 196,458 206,803 (5 %) 585,101 586,639 — Europe 143,045 149,022 (4 %) 428,079 458,890 (7 %) Total net sales $ 577,278 $ 578,021 — $ 1,690,302 $ 1,704,910 (1 %) In the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, sales in China were negatively impacted by economic uncertainty caused by certain regulatory changes in our food and pharmaceutical markets. The increase in sales in Japan was driven by instrument systems, primarily to pharmaceutical customers, and foreign currency translation, which increased Japan’s sales growth by 5% and 1% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Sales growth in Asia Other was broad-based across all product and customer classes in 2019. Sales growth in the U.S. declined as a result of our large pharmaceutical customers decreasing capital spending on our instrument systems in the third quarter of 2019, which has resulted low single-digit sales growth in the first nine months of 2019. Sales declines in the rest of the Americas and Europe were broad-based across all product and customer classes due to macroeconomic conditions and political instability. Sales in Europe were also negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales 4% and 5% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. 36 Table of Contents Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 % change September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 % change Pharmaceutical $ 328,227 $ 325,166 1 % $ 972,884 $ 968,848 — Industrial 171,352 171,985 — 502,679 517,979 (3 %) Academic and governmental 77,699 80,870 (4 %) 214,739 218,083 (2 %) Total net sales $ 577,278 $ 578,021 0 % $ 1,690,302 $ 1,704,910 (1 %) In the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, sales to pharmaceutical customers were negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 2% and 3%, respectively, as well as a slower release of capital budgets by our customers due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions due to Brexit, particularly in Europe, and regulatory changes in our food and pharmaceutical markets in China. The decline in sales to industrial customers in the third quarter was primarily due to weaker demand for our LC-MS instruments, while the decline in the first nine months of 2019 was primarily due to a 2% decline in TA sales. The decrease in sales to academic and governmental customers was broad-based across all product classes, with increases in Europe and Asia Other being offset by declines in other regions. Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services are as follows for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 28, 2019 % of Total September 29, 2018 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 223,859 44 % $ 238,986 46 % (6 %) Chemistry consumables 100,256 19 % 95,979 19 % 4 % Total Waters product sales 324,115 63 % 334,965 65 % (3 %) Waters service 188,031 37 % 180,830 35 % 4 % Total Waters net sales $ 512,146 100 % $ 515,795 100 % (1 %) Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 % of Total September 29, 2018 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 647,248 43 % $ 677,017 45 % (4 %) Chemistry consumables 299,801 20 % 293,818 19 % 2 % Total Waters product sales 947,049 63 % 970,835 64 % (2 %) Waters service 556,128 37 % 543,411 36 % 2 % Total Waters net sales $ 1,503,177 100 % $ 1,514,246 100 % (1 %) The effect of foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales by 1% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Waters service sales benefited from increased sales of service plans and higher service demand billings to a larger installed base of customers. Precision chemistry consumables sales increased on the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits and were driven by sales in the U.S. and China primarily to pharmaceutical customers. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 1% and 2% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, as well as one less calendar day in the first nine months of 2019. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) decreased in most major geographical regions, primarily due to lower sales to pharmaceutical and industrial customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions relating to Brexit and other regulatory changes in certain regions. In the third quarter of 2019, Waters sales decreased 6% in the Americas and 4% in Europe, and increased 6% in Asia. Foreign currency translation decreased Europe’s sales by 4%. Within Asia, Waters sales increased 2%, 9% and 18% in China, Japan and the rest of Asia, respectively. In the first nine months of 2019, Waters sales increased 3% in Asia but decreased 1% and 6% in the Americas and in Europe, respectively, where the effect of foreign currency decreased sales by 5%. Within Asia, Waters sales were flat in China and increased 4% in Japan and 12% in the rest of Asia. 37 Table of Contents TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services are as follows for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 28, 2019 % of Total September 29, 2018 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 46,458 71 % $ 43,557 70 % 7 % TA service 18,674 29 % 18,669 30 % — Total TA net sales $ 65,132 100 % $ 62,226 100 % 5 % Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 % of Total September 29, 2018 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 131,292 70 % $ 135,673 71 % (3 %) TA service 55,833 30 % 54,991 29 % 2 % Total TA net sales $ 187,125 100 % $ 190,664 100 % (2 %) The increase in TA instrument system sales in the third quarter of 2019 can be attributed to strong sales growth in Asia Other and the U.S. for TA’s thermal analysis and microcalorimetry instrument systems. The decrease in TA’s instrument system sales in the first nine months of 2019 was primarily due to lower customer demand resulting from macroeconomic conditions, tariff posturing and political instability. TA service sales increased due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation was flat and decreased TA sales 1% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. In the third quarter of 2019, TA sales increased 13% in Asia and 3% in the Americas, but decreased 4% in Europe. For the first nine months of 2019, TA sales increased 2% in the Americas and 1% in Asia, but decreased 14% in Europe. TA’s sales in the U.S. increased 4% in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. TA sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales 3% and 4% in third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was flat and increased 1%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 due to a change in sales mix. The effect of foreign currency translation on cost of sales had a slight impact on the third quarter of 2019, but increased cost of sales by 2% for the first nine months of 2019. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to negatively impact gross profit for the remainder of 2019. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased 1% for the third quarter of 2019 and were flat year-to-date. Selling and administrative expenses for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2019 were impacted by higher merit compensation costs that were offset by lower variable incentive compensation costs. In addition, the first nine months of 2019 were impacted by the $9 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 1% for the third quarter of 2019 and did not have a significant impact on such expenses for the first nine months of 2019. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 22.3% and 23.7% for the third quarter of 2019 and year-to-date, respectively, and 22.3% and 23.4% for the third quarter of 2018 and year-to-date, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased 2% in the third quarter and increased 1% in the first nine months of 2019, primarily as a result of merit compensation increases and the costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased research and development expenses by 2% for the third quarter and 3% for the first nine months of 2019, as the weakening of the British pound had a favorable effect on the currency translation of the Company’s U.K.-based research and development expenses. Interest Expense, Net The increase in net interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was primarily attributable to higher outstanding debt balances and lower interest income on lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, being somewhat offset by the additional interest income from the U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates were 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of September 28, 2019. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 by $15 million and $21 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.21 and $0.26, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 was 16.1% and 16.7%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to a $2 million expense in the third quarter of 2018 related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act. This increase in income tax expense increased the effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in the third quarter of 2018. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 was 13.7% and 15.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 includes a $3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the 2017 Tax Act. This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by .7 percentage points for the first nine months of 2019. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 includes $6 million of additional income tax expense related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act. This additional income tax expense increased the effective tax rate by 1.3 percentage points for the first nine months of 2018. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 39 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Net income $ 391,529 $ 408,642 Depreciation and amortization 80,319 82,811 Stock-based compensation 28,917 28,184 Deferred income taxes 1,817 278 Change in accounts receivable 57,897 36,893 Change in inventories (83,973 ) (47,826 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (493 ) (93,637 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 34,926 23,085 Effect of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (3,229 ) 12,450 Other changes (56,518 ) (27,983 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 451,192 422,897 Net cash provided by investing activities 825,441 1,257,718 Net cash used in financing activities (1,661,541 ) (1,626,443 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (6,723 ) (7,118 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (391,631 ) $ 47,054 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $451 million and $423 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 80 days at September 28, 2019 as compared to 77 days at September 29, 2018. • The changes in inventory were primarily attributable to new product launches and a build of safety stock inventory in advance of the Brexit decision, as well as lower than anticipated sales volumes. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $825 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities that totaled $1,258 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2018. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $110 million and $64 million in the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash, investments and debt capacity. The Company has incurred $51 million of costs associated with the construction of this facility during the nine months ended September 28, 2019. 40 Table of Contents During the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company purchased $36 million and $908 million of investments, respectively, while $978 million and $2,269 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. Cash Flow from Financing Activities In September 2019, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Series L $200 million notes have a seven-year term and a fixed interest rate of 3.31%. The Series M $300 million notes have a 10-year term and a fixed interest rate of 3.53% The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. During the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company’s net debt borrowings increased by $210 million and decreased by $850 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 29, 2018, the Company reduced its outstanding debt using cash repatriated under the 2017 Tax Act. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had a total of $1.4 billion in outstanding debt, which consisted of $1.1 billion in outstanding senior unsecured notes and $300 million borrowed under a term loan under the credit agreement dated November 2017 (“2017 Credit Agreement”). As of September 28, 2019, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1.5 billion after outstanding letters of credit. As of September 28, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. In 2018 and April 2019, the Company entered into $410 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased $1.9 billion and $809 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $8 million and $9 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. The Company expects to increase its share repurchase activity in 2019 as compared to 2018 and intends to use existing cash and investments, cash flows from operations and, as needed, borrowings under its existing credit facilities to fund its repurchases under its share repurchase program. The Company received $34 million and $42 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $405 million as of September 28, 2019. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generated from foreign operations, with $303 million held by foreign subsidiaries at September 28, 2019, of which $235 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The Company believes it has sufficient levels of cash flow and access to its existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S. These cash requirements are managed by the Company’s cash flow from operations, its existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of the Company’s revolving credit facility. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least 41 Table of Contents the next twelve months. The Company has conducted a post-tax reform evaluation of its capital allocation strategy and the Company is currently planning to use its existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and available debt capacity to repurchase up to $4 billion of the Company’s common stock over the next two years. The Company is working towards a near-term capital structure of approximately 2.5 times the Company’s net debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio to fund a significant portion of these share repurchases. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it will provide income taxes on all future foreign earnings and reverse its historical assertion that its foreign earnings were permanently invested. However, the Company will continue to be permanently reinvested in relation to the cumulative historical outside basis difference that is not related to the unremitted earnings. There have been no other significant changes to the Company’s financial position. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 28, 2019 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, with the exception of the recently issued senior unsecured notes as described in Note 6, “Debt.” From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2019, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation, business combinations and asset acquisitions and valuation of contingent consideration. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 28, 2019. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the nine months ended September 28, 2019. 42 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements Please refer to Note 14, Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments, in the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of September 28, 2019, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $303 million out of $405 million and $471 million out of $1,735 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $235 million out of $405 million and $251 million out of $1,735 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at September 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of September 28, 2019 would decrease by approximately $24 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the nine months ended September 28, 2019. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, 44 Table of Contents the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2019 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Change in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 28, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended September 28, 2019 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of September 28, 2019 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K/A. Note, however, the discussion under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

the consolidated financial statements. 9 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Waters Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”) and mass spectrometry (“MS”) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (“LC-MS”) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as “proteomics”), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Company’s instruments, as well as other manufacturers’ instruments. The Company’s interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Company’s fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Company’s second fiscal quarters for 2019 and 2018 ended on June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is management’s opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 1, 2019. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Company’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entity’s cash flows. For most of the Company’s foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. 10 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $ 421 million out of $ 676 million and $ 471 million out of $ 1,735 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $ 256 million out of $676 million and $ 251 million out of $1,735 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including historical experience and the customer’s credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged against the allowance when the Company determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in thousands): Balance at Balance at Beginning End of of Period Additions Deduction Period Allowance for Doubtful Accounts June 29, 2019 $ 7,663 $ 3,793 $ ( 3,426 ) $ 8,030 June 30, 2018 $ 6,109 $ 1,825 $ ( 1,778 ) $ 6,156 Other Investments During the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the Company made investments in unaffiliated companies of $ 5 million and $ 3 million, respectively. Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 11 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 29, 2019 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Markets Other Significant Total at for Identical Observable Unobservable June 29, Assets Inputs Inputs 2019 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 66,225 $ — $ 66,225 $ — Corporate debt securities 94,335 — 94,335 — Time deposits 57,964 — 57,964 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 33,278 33,278 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 164 — 164 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 1,098 — 1,098 — Total $ 253,064 $ 33,278 $ 219,786 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,707 $ — $ — $ 2,707 Foreign currency exchange contracts 292 — 292 — Total $ 2,999 $ — $ 292 $ 2,707 The following table represents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Active Significant Markets Other Significant Total at for Identical Observable Unobservable December 31, Assets Inputs Inputs 2018 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: U.S. Treasury securities $ 164,315 $ — $ 164,315 $ — Foreign government securities 3,463 — 3,463 — Corporate debt securities 723,059 — 723,059 — Time deposits 108,638 — 108,638 — Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets 33,104 33,104 — — Foreign currency exchange contracts 503 — 503 — Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements 1,093 1,093 Total $ 1,034,175 $ 33,104 $ 1,001,071 $ — Liabilities: Contingent consideration $ 2,476 $ — $ — $ 2,476 Foreign currency exchange contracts 224 — 224 — Total $ 2,700 $ — $ 224 $ 2,476 12 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Company’s liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the July 2014 acquisition of Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Company’s creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. Although there is no contractual limit, the fair value of future contingent consideration payments was estimated to be $3 million and $2 million at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, based on the Company’s best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products, some of which are currently in development, through 2034. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was $ 510 million at both June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $ 512 million and $ 502 million at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars and when any of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Company’s principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. 13 CONDENSED N OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Company’s net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Company’s currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements In 2018, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. In 2019, the Company entered into additional interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 110 million and contract terms between one and three years. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations . The Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): June 29, 2019 December 31, 2018 Notional Value Fair Value Notional Value Fair Value Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets $ 31,270 $ 164 $ 112,212 $ 503 Other current liabilities $ 124,346 $ 292 $ 40,175 $ 224 Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other assets $ 410,000 $ 1,098 $ 300,000 $ 1,093 Accumulated other comprehensive income $ ( 1,098 ) $ ( 1,093 ) The following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts (in thousands): Financial Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Statement June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Classification Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized gains (losses) on closed contracts Cost of sales $ 136 $ ( 4,096 ) $ ( 407 ) $ ( 2,158 ) Unrealized losses on open contracts Cost of sales ( 3,044 ) ( 105 ) ( 2,518 ) ( 1,092 ) Cumulative net pre-tax losses Cost of sales $ ( 2,908 ) $ ( 4,201 ) $ ( 2,925 ) $ ( 3,250 ) Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Interest income $ 2,923 $ — $ 5,150 $ — Unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts Stockholders’ equity $ ( 6,022 ) $ — $ 1,098 $ — 14 CONDENSED N OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Stockholders’ Equity In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 5.9 million and 2.7 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $ 1.3 billion and $ 546 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. As of June 29, 2019, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 5.1 million shares at a cost of $ 1.2 billion under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $ 2.8 billion authorized for future repurchases. In addition, the Company repurchased $ 8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions. As of June 29, 2019, the Company accrued $10 million as a result of treasury stock purchases that were settled in the third quarter of 2019. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s accrued warranty liability for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in thousands): Balance at Balance at Beginning Accruals for Settlements End of of Period Warranties Made Period Accrued warranty liability: June 29, 2019 $ 12,300 $ 3,571 $ ( 4,288 ) $ 11,583 June 30, 2018 $ 13,026 $ 3,588 $ ( 4,115 ) $ 12,499 Restructuring and Other Charges In January 2019, the Company made organizational changes to better align our resources with our growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 1 % of the Company’s employees. The Company recorded $ 1 million and $ 9 million of severance and related costs during the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, respectively. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. Revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. In substantially all of the Company’s arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the Company determined control transfers at the point of shipment. In more limited cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site. All incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of 15 CONDENSED N OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) sales. In situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the Company’s obligation to ship the products to its customers, the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. Accordingly, such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer. In more rare situations, the Company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. The Company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions and collected by the Company from a customer . Generally, the Company’s contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. The Company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. The Company determines relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. In developing these estimates, the Company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors. The Company has sales from standalone software, which is included in instrument systems revenue. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the Company has determined are distinct performance obligations. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. Payment terms and conditions vary among the Company’s revenue streams, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. Prior to providing payment terms to customers, an evaluation of the customer’s credit risk is performed. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and, therefore, there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products. Service revenue includes (1) service and software maintenance contracts and (2) service calls (time and materials). Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. The amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. The Company’s deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue and customer advances for the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in thousands): June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 204,257 $ 192,590 Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period ( 172,949 ) ( 138,227 ) Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 229,162 186,392 Balance at the end of the period $ 260,470 $ 240,755 The Company classified $ 40 million and $ 39 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 16 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The amount of deferred revenue and customer advances equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period presented.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 12 million for both the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 25 million for both the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $ 50 million per year for each of the next five years. 18 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 6 Debt In November 2017, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $ 1.5 billion revolving facility and a $ 300 million term loan. The revolving facility and term loan both mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Company’s option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate in effect on such day, (2) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (3) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of both June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of $ 560 million of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for Series H and J senior unsecured notes. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. In 2018, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. In 2019, the Company entered into additional interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 110 million and contract terms between one and three years. See Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” 19 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company had the following outstanding debt at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (in thousands): June 29, 2019 December 31, 2018 Foreign subsidiary lines of credit $ 295 $ 178 Senior unsecured notes - Series B - 5.00%, due February 2020 100,000 — Total notes payable and debt, current 100,295 178 Senior unsecured notes - Series B - 5.00 %, due February 2020 — 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series E - 3.97 %, due March 2021 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series F - 3.40 %, due June 2021 100,000 100,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92 %, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13 %, due May 2023 50,000 50,000 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44 %, due May 2026 160,000 160,000 Credit agreement 590,000 590,000 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 1,606 ) ( 1,828 ) Total long-term debt 1,048,394 1,148,172 Total debt $ 1,148,689 $ 1,148,350 * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25 %. As of both June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $ 1,208 million after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 3.74 % and 3.83 % at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of June 29, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $ 106 million and $ 90 million at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to these short-term borrowings were 1.48 % and 1.88 % for June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates are 21 %, 12.5 %, 19 % and 17 %, respectively, as of June 29, 2019. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0 % on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 by $ 9 million and $ 13 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $ 0.13 and $ 0.17 , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 was 15.9 % and 10.8 %, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to a $ 9 million reduction in the three months ended June 30, 2018 income tax expense related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act and an additional $ 1 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This reduction in income tax expense decreased the effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points for the three months ended June 30 , 2018 . The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 was 12.4 % and 15.1 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 29, 2019 includes a $ 3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). This 20 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.0 percentage points for the six months ended June 29, 2019. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018 includes $ 4 million of additional income tax expense related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act. This additional income tax expense increased the effective tax rate by 1.3 percentage points for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s uncertain tax positions for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in thousands): June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 26,108 $ 5,843 Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period ( 105 ) ( 191 ) Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period 801 408 Balance at the end of the period $ 26,804 $ 6,060 With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2013. However, carryforward tax attributes that were generated in years beginning on or before January 1, 2014 may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if the attributes are utilized. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of June 29, 2019, the Company expects to record additional reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of less than $ 1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Leases The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach that was applied to leases existing as of, or entered into after, January 1, 2019. The Company elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward historical assessments of (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a right-of-use lease asset and lease liabilities in the amount $ 100 million as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and retained earnings. Prior to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, undiscounted future minimum rents payable as of December 31, 2018 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year were as follows (in thousands): 2019 $ 28,417 2020 23,424 2021 16,032 2022 11,816 2023 and thereafter 23,269 Total future minimum lease payments $ 102,958 21 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) The Company’s operating leases consist of property leases for sales, demonstration, laboratory, warehouse and office spaces, automotive leases for sales and service personnel and equipment leases, primarily used in our manufacturing and distribution operations. The lease policies described below were effective as of January 1 , 2019 . For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company recorded the related right-of-use asset and lease liability obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term of the leases. Some of the Company’s leases include rental escalation clauses, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into our determination of lease payments. A certain number of these leases contain rent escalation clauses, either fixed or adjusted periodically for inflation of market rates, that are factored into the Company’s determination of lease payments. The Company also has variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, primarily for items such as common area maintenance and real estate taxes, which are recorded as variable costs when incurred. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements that contain lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component. The Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements of the new accounting guidance to leases with terms less than 12 months. For these leases, the Company recognizes lease payments in net income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. As of June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company does not have leases that are classified as finance leases. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to determine the present value of the lease liabilities; however, most of the leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate and, as required by the accounting guidance, the Company estimated its incremental secured borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement (or, for the leases in existence on the adoption date, the January 1, 2019 information). The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the estimated rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As of June 29, 2019, the Company has lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2033, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 4.9 years. Rental expense was $ 9 million for the three months ended June 29, 2019 under the new lease accounting standard and $ 8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 under the previous lease accounting standard. Rental expense was $ 18 million for the six months ended June 29, 2019 under the new lease accounting standard and $ 15 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 under the previous lease accounting standard. As of June 29, 2019, the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of lease liabilities was 3.94 %. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities in operating activities in the statement of cash flows was $ 18 million during the six months ended June 29, 2019. The Company’s right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification June 29, 2019 Assets: Property operating lease assets Operating lease assets $ 61,646 Automobile operating lease assets Operating lease assets 27,217 Equipment operating lease assets Operating lease assets 2,197 Total lease assets $ 91,060 Liabilities: Current operating lease liabilities Current operating lease liabilities $ 25,106 Long-term operating lease liabilities Long-term operating lease liabilities 66,713 Total lease liabilities $ 91,819 22 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Undiscounted future minimum rents payable as of June 29, 2019 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year reconcile to lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet as follows (in thousands): 2019 (remaining 6 months) $ 14,291 2020 24,596 2021 16,296 2022 10,462 2023 5,875 2024 and thereafter 31,161 Total future minimum lease payments 102,681 Less: amount of lease payments representing interest ( 10,862 ) Present value of future minimum lease payments 91,819 Less: current operating lease liabilities (25,106 ) Long-term operating lease liabilities $ 66,713 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various shareholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Cost of sales $ 567 $ 603 $ 1,142 $ 1,208 Selling and administrative expenses 7,402 7,639 15,527 16,123 Research and development expenses 1,345 837 2,586 1,640 Total stock-based compensation $ 9,314 $ 9,079 $ 19,255 $ 18,971 23 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 are as follows: Six Months Ended Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Options issued in thousands 139 140 Risk-free interest rate 2.5 % 2.7 % Expected life in years 5 6 Expected volatility 24.3 % 23.2 % Expected dividends — — Six Months Ended Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Exercise price $ 231.30 $ 205.97 Fair value $ 61.85 $ 58.26 The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the six months ended June 29, 2019 (in thousands, except per share data): Number of Shares Exercise Price per Share Weighted-Average Exercise Price per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2018 1,790 $ 38.09 to $ 208.47 $ 142.47 Granted 139 $ 183.41 to $ 238.52 $ 231.30 Exercised ( 239 ) $ 38.09 to $ 208.47 $ 110.07 Canceled ( 56 ) $ 113.36 to $ 194.26 $ 153.14 Outstanding at June 29, 2019 1,634 $ 61.63 to $ 238.52 $ 154.40 Restricted Stock During the six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company granted five thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $ 183.41 . Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the six months ended June 29, 2019 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2018 304 $ 153.31 Granted 83 $ 236.28 Vested ( 103 ) $ 138.61 Forfeited ( 15 ) $ 167.10 Unvested at June 29, 2019 269 $ 183.77 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. 24 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Performance Stock Units The Company’s performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target shares awarded. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period . The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 are as follows: Six Months Ended Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Performance stock units issued (in thousands) 13 16 Risk-free interest rate 2.4 % 2.0 % Expected life in years 2.8 2.8 Expected volatility 23.5 % 23.4 % Average volatility of peer companies 26.2 % 25.8 % Correlation coefficient 34.2 % 37.2 % Expected dividends — — The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the six months ended June 29, 2019 (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Weighted-Average Fair Value per Share Unvested at December 31, 2018 100 $ 212.34 Granted 13 $ 372.68 Forfeited ( 6 ) $ 208.58 Unvested at June 29, 2019 107 $ 232.79 25 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 10 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended June 29, 2019 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 144,410 68,989 $ 2.09 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 505 ( 0.01 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 144,410 69,494 $ 2.08 Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 155,677 77,833 $ 2.00 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 605 ( 0.02 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 155,677 78,438 $ 1.98 Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 253,396 70,331 $ 3.60 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 573 ( 0.03 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 253,396 70,904 $ 3.57 Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Net Income Weighted- Average Shares Per Share (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount Net income per basic common share $ 267,628 78,330 $ 3.42 Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities — 711 ( 0.03 ) Net income per diluted common share $ 267,628 79,041 $ 3.39 For both the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company had 0.1 million stock options that were antidilutive due to having higher exercise prices than the Company’s average stock price during the period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 26 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) 11 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are detailed as follows (in thousands): Currency Translation Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Retirement Plans Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ ( 105,697 ) $ ( 9,869 ) $ ( 2,405 ) $ ( 117,971 ) Other comprehensive income, net of tax 491 34 2,350 2,875 Balance at June 29, 2019 $ ( 105,206 ) $ ( 9,835 ) $ ( 55 ) $ ( 115,096 ) 12 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans.

The Company also anticipates that it will settle the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan during 2019, and the Company may incur pension accounting charges in connection with the termination of this plan. 27 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) During fiscal year 2019, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $ 3 million to $ 6 million to the Company’s defined benefit plans. 13 Business Segment Information The Company’s business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Company’s two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. 28 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Net sales for the Company’s products and services are as follows for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Product net sales: Waters instrument systems $ 238,777 $ 239,928 $ 423,389 $ 438,031 Chemistry consumables 100,292 99,129 199,545 197,839 TA instrument systems 48,196 49,812 84,834 92,116 Total product sales 387,265 388,869 707,768 727,986 Service net sales: Waters service 192,048 188,248 368,097 362,581 TA service 19,849 19,102 37,159 36,322 Total service sales 211,897 207,350 405,256 398,903 Total net sales $ 599,162 $ 596,219 $ 1,113,024 $ 1,126,889 Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

This new comprehensive lease standard amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases. The core principle of the new guidance requires lessees to present the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on their balance sheets. This guidance was effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company has adopted this standard using a modified retrospective transition approach to be applied to leases existing as of, or entered into after, January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the Company’s balance sheet by recording a right-of-use lease asset and lease liabilities in the amount $ 100 million as of January 1, 2019; however, it did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and retained earnings. In March 2017, accounting guidance was issued to amend the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amortization period for certain callable debt securities was shortened to end at the earliest call date. This guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2018, accounting guidance was issued to address the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Current accounting guidance requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates with the effect recorded in income from continuing operations, even if the related tax effects were originally recognized in other comprehensive income, the new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. This guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued to address the capitalization of implementation costs associated with hosting arrangements that meet the definition of a service contract. The new guidance clarified that the internal-use software capitalization guidance should be used to determine when implementation costs are capitalizable. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to prospectively adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 30 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) – (Continued) Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the recognition of credit losses related to financial assets, such as debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and other financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash. Current guidance requires the recognition of a credit loss when it is considered probable that a loss event has occurred. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and non-credit components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company currently does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company currently does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of retirement benefit plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 31 Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”), ultra performance liquid chromatography (“UPLC TM ” and together with HPLC, referred to as “LC”), mass spectrometry (“MS”) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Company’s products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers. These customers use the Company’s products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. The Company’s operating results are as follows for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 % change June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 % change Revenues: Product sales $ 387,265 $ 388,869 — $ 707,768 $ 727,986 (3 %) Service sales 211,897 207,350 2 % 405,256 398,903 2 % Total net sales 599,162 596,219 — 1,113,024 1,126,889 (1 %) Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales 249,546 243,135 3 % 470,577 464,556 1 % Selling and administrative expenses 133,208 136,645 (3 %) 267,547 267,052 — Research and development expenses 36,490 35,644 2 % 71,550 70,124 2 % Purchased intangibles amortization 2,264 1,602 41 % 4,545 3,261 39 % Litigation settlement — — — — (1,672 ) 100 % Operating income 177,654 179,193 (1 %) 298,805 323,568 (8 %) Operating income as a % of sales 29.7 % 30.1 % 26.8 % 28.7 % Other expense (342 ) (1,828 ) (81 %) (867 ) (1,482 ) (41 %) Interest expense, net (5,577 ) (2,804 ) 99 % (8,825 ) (6,976 ) 27 % Income before income taxes 171,735 174,561 (2 %) 289,113 315,110 (8 %) Provision for income taxes 27,325 18,884 45 % 35,717 47,482 (25 %) Net income $ 144,410 $ 155,677 (7 %) $ 253,396 $ 267,628 (5 %) Net income per diluted common share $ 2.08 $ 1.98 5 % $ 3.57 $ 3.39 5 % The Company’s sales were flat for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 and decreased 1% for the first half of 2019 as compared to the first half of 2018. Foreign currency translation decreased sales growth by 2% for both the second quarter and first half of 2019. Recent acquisitions did not have an impact on sales growth in either the second quarter or first half of 2019. Unless otherwise noted, sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared with the same period in the prior year. Instrument system sales decreased 1% and 4% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively, as a result of weaker demand for our products by our customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic impacts relating to Brexit and governmental policy changes in certain regions. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales by 1% and 2% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 2% and 1% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively, as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales. In the second quarter and first half of 2019, recurring revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 2% and 3%, respectively, as well as one less calendar day as compared to the first half of 2018. 32 In the second quarter of 2019, the Company’s sales increased 4% in the Americas and 1% in Asia, while sales decreased 5% in Europe. For the first half of 2019, the Company’s sales increased 2% in the Americas, were flat in Asia and decreased 8% in Europe. Sales growth in the Americas was driven by increases in the U.S. of 8% and 5% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively, which were partially offset by declines in Latin America of 14% and 13%, respectively, due to lower levels of customer spending. Sales growth in Asia was driven by sales growth in Japan of 6% and 4% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively, which were offset by declines in India in both the second quarter and first half of 2019, primarily caused by the effect of foreign currency translation. China sales increased 3% in the second quarter of 2019, but were flat for the first half due to economic uncertainty in the first quarter of 2019 stemming from governmental policy in our food and pharmaceutical markets. Sales in Europe were impacted by weak demand in Eastern Europe and the effect of foreign currency translation, which reduced the sales growth rate by 3% and 5% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. Sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 3% for the second quarter of 2019 and were flat for the first half of 2019, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 2% and 3%, respectively. Sales to pharmaceutical customers were driven by an increasing need for global access to prescription drugs and testing of newer and more complex biologic drugs. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, declined 4% for both the second quarter and first half of 2019, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 1% for both the second quarter and first half of 2019. Sales to our industrial customers have been negatively impacted by lower customer demand for our LC, MS and TA instrument systems. Combined sales to academic and governmental customers decreased 2% in the second quarter of 2019 and were flat for the first half of 2019, primarily due to the timing of the release of funds by governments and the negative effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales growth by 2% for both the second quarter and first half of 2019. Operating income decreased 1% and 8% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. These decreases were primarily a result of the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, as well as $1 million and $9 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce in the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. In addition, operating income in the first half of 2018 included the benefit of a $2 million litigation settlement. The Company generated $303 million and $277 million of net cash flows from operations in the first half of 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily a result of a $15 million litigation settlement payment in 2018 that did not recur. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $65 million and $37 million in the first half of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The first half of 2019 includes $33 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Company’s precision chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $48 million on this facility through the end of the first half of 2019 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. During the first half of 2019 and 2018, the Company made $5 million and $3 million of investments in unaffiliated companies, respectively. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the first six months of 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased $1.3 billion and $546 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Company’s sales and profits. 33 Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 % change June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 % change Net Sales: Asia: China $ 112,796 $ 109,709 3 % $ 202,887 $ 203,537 — Japan 45,958 43,183 6 % 89,462 85,948 4 % Asia Other 80,081 84,013 (5 %) 146,998 147,700 — Total Asia 238,835 236,905 1 % 439,347 437,185 — Americas: United States 173,940 161,485 8 % 323,097 308,306 5 % Americas Other 32,835 36,641 (10 %) 65,546 71,530 (8 %) Total Americas 206,775 198,126 4 % 388,643 379,836 2 % Europe 153,552 161,188 (5 %) 285,034 309,868 (8 %) Total net sales $ 599,162 $ 596,219 — $ 1,113,024 $ 1,126,889 (1 %) In the second quarter and first half of 2019, sales in China were negatively impacted by economic uncertainty caused by certain regulatory changes in our food and pharmaceutical markets. The increase in sales in Japan was driven by double-digit growth in TA products and services, as well as strong performance by Waters products and services. Sales in Asia Other were driven by LC-MS instrument systems, primarily to academic and governmental customers. Sales growth in the U.S. was broad-based across all product and customer classes, while sales declines in the rest of the Americas and Europe were broad-based across all product and customer classes due to macroeconomic conditions. Sales in Europe were also negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales 3% and 5% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 % change June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 % change Pharmaceutical $ 350,145 $ 338,354 3 % $ 644,657 $ 643,682 0 % Industrial 176,109 183,664 (4 %) 331,327 345,994 (4 %) Academic and governmental 72,908 74,201 (2 %) 137,040 137,213 0 % Total net sales $ 599,162 $ 596,219 0 % $ 1,113,024 $ 1,126,889 (1 %) In the second quarter and first half of 2019, sales to pharmaceutical customers were negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 2% and 3%, respectively, as well as a slower release of capital budgets by our customers due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions due to Brexit, particularly in Europe, and regulatory changes in our food and pharmaceutical markets in China. The decline in sales to industrial customers in the second quarter was primarily due to weaker demand for our LC-MS instruments, while the decline in the first half of 2019 was primarily due to a 5% decline in TA sales. The decrease in sales to academic and governmental customers was broad-based across all product classes, with increases in North America and Asia Other being offset by declines in other regions. 34 Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services are as follows for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended June 29, 2019 % of Total June 30, 2018 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 238,777 45 % $ 239,928 46 % — Chemistry consumables 100,292 19 % 99,129 18 % 1 % Total Waters product sales 339,069 64 % 339,057 64 % — Waters service 192,048 36 % 188,248 36 % 2 % Total Waters net sales $ 531,117 100 % $ 527,305 100 % 1 % Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 % of Total June 30, 2018 % of Total % change Waters instrument systems $ 423,389 43 % $ 438,031 44 % (3 %) Chemistry consumables 199,545 20 % 197,839 20 % 1 % Total Waters product sales 622,934 63 % 635,870 64 % (2 %) Waters service 368,097 37 % 362,581 36 % 2 % Total Waters net sales $ 991,031 100 % $ 998,451 100 % (1 %) The effect of foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales by 2% for both the second quarter and first half of 2019. Waters service sales benefited from increased sales of service plans and higher service demand billings to a higher installed base of customers. Precision chemistry consumables sales increased on the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits and were driven by sales in the U.S. and China primarily to pharmaceutical customers. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by the negative impact of foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 3% in both the second quarter and first half of 2019 as compared to the second quarter and first half of 2018, as well as one less calendar day in the first half of 2019. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) decreased in all major geographical regions, primarily due to lower sales to pharmaceutical and industrial customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions relating to Brexit and other regulatory changes in certain regions. In the second quarter of 2019, Waters sales increased 4% in the Americas, 2% in Asia and decreased 4% in Europe, where the effect of foreign currency decreased sales by 3%. Within Asia, Waters sales increased 2% and 5% in China and Japan, respectively, and were flat in the rest of Asia. In the first half of 2019, Waters sales increased 2% in the Americas, 1% in Asia and decreased 7% in Europe, where the effect of foreign currency decreased sales by 5%. Within Asia, Waters sales were flat in China and increased 2% in both Japan and the rest of Asia. 35 TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services are as follows for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended June 29, 2019 % of Total June 30, 2018 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 48,196 71 % $ 49,812 72 % (3 %) TA service 19,849 29 % 19,102 28 % 4 % Total TA net sales $ 68,045 100 % $ 68,914 100 % (1 %) Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 % of Total June 30, 2018 % of Total % change TA instrument systems $ 84,834 70 % $ 92,116 72 % (8 %) TA service 37,159 30 % 36,322 28 % 2 % Total TA net sales $ 121,993 100 % $ 128,438 100 % (5 %) The decline in TA instrument system sales was primarily due to lower customer demand resulting from macroeconomic conditions, tariff posturing and political instability. TA service sales increased due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased TA sales 1% for both the second quarter and first half of 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, TA sales increased 9% in the Americas, but decreased 10% in Europe and 7% in Asia. For the first half of 2019, TA sales increased 2% in the Americas, but decreased 19% in Europe and 4% in Asia. TA’s sales in the U.S. increased 12% and 4% in the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. TA sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales 3% and 4% in second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. Within Asia, TA sales growth in Japan and China were offset by declines in the rest of Asia. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the second quarter and first half of 2019 increased 3% and 1%, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first half of 2018 due to a change in sales mix. The effect of foreign currency translation had a slight impact on the second quarter of 2019, but increased cost of sales by 2% for the first half of 2019. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to negatively impact gross profit for the remainder of 2019. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased 3% for the second quarter and were flat year-to-date. Selling and administrative expenses were impacted by higher merit compensation costs, as well as $1 million and $9 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce in the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased selling and administrative expenses by 3% and 4% for the second quarter and first half of 2019, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 22.2% and 24.0% for the 2019 quarter and year-to-date, respectively, and 22.9% and 23.7% for the 2018 quarter and year-to-date, respectively. 36 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 2% in both the second quarter and first half of 2019, primarily as a result of merit compensation and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased research and development expenses by 3% for both the second quarter and first half of 2019 on the Company’s U.K.-based research and development expenses, as the British pound weakened against the U.S. dollar as compared to the second quarter and first half of 2018. Litigation Settlement In the second quarter of 2017, the Company incurred an $11 million litigation provision related to the issuance of a verdict in a patent litigation case. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company resolved the case with a final settlement that resulted in a gain of $2 million. Interest Expense, Net The increase in net interest expense in the second quarter and first half of 2019 was primarily attributable to lower interest income on lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, offset by the additional interest income from the U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements entered into during the second half of 2018 and second quarter of 2019. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates are 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of June 29, 2019. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Company’s net income for the first half of 2019 and 2018 by $9 million and $13 million, respectively, and increased the Company’s net income per diluted share by $0.13 and $0.17, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 and 2018 was 15.9% and 10.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate can be attributed to a $9 million reduction in the second quarter 2018 income tax expense related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act and an additional $1 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. This reduction in income tax expense decreased the effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points for the second quarter of 2018. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first half of 2019 and 2018 was 12.4% and 15.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2019 includes a $3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 1.0 percentage points for the first half of 2019. The effective tax rate for the first half of 2018 includes $4 million of additional income tax expense related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act. This additional income tax expense increased the effective tax rate by 1.3 percentage points for the first half of 2018. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 37 Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Net income $ 253,396 $ 267,628 Depreciation and amortization 53,615 55,836 Stock-based compensation 19,255 18,971 Deferred income taxes 1,632 (2,992 ) Change in accounts receivable 52,508 36,591 Change in inventories (62,200 ) (33,877 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (10,439 ) (77,848 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 54,672 40,134 Effect of the 2017 Tax Act (3,229 ) 12,450 Other changes (56,407 ) (40,336 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 302,803 276,557 Net cash provided by investing activities 785,063 1,206,382 Net cash used in financing activities (1,294,734 ) (1,370,231 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1,414 ) (12,823 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (208,282 ) $ 99,885 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $303 million and $277 million during the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: • The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 79 days at June 29, 2019 as compared to 75 days at June 30, 2018. • The changes in inventory were primarily attributable to anticipated annual increases in sales volumes, as well as new product launches and a build of safety stock inventory in advance of the Brexit decision. • The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. • Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. • Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $785 million in the six months ended June 29, 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities that totaled $1,206 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $65 million and $37 million in the first half of 2019 and 2018, respectively. In February 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash, investments and debt capacity. The Company has incurred $33 million of costs associated with the construction of this facility during the first half of 2019, and has incurred a total of $48 million through the end of the second quarter 2019. During the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the Company purchased $36 million and $513 million of investments, respectively, while $891 million and $1,760 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. 38 Cash Flow from Financing Activities During the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the Company’s net debt borrowings were flat and decreased by $850 million, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company reduced its outstanding debt using cash repatriated under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). As of June 29, 2019, the Company had a total of $1,149 million in outstanding debt, which consisted of $560 million in outstanding senior unsecured notes, $300 million borrowed under a term loan and $290 million borrowed under a revolving credit facility, with both the term loan and revolving credit facilities under the credit agreement dated November 2017 (“2017 Credit Agreement”). As of June 29, 2019, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1,208 million after outstanding letters of credit. As of June 29, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. In 2018 and April 2019, the Company entered into $410 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Company’s net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the first half of 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased $1,321 million and $546 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018. The Company expects to increase its share repurchase activity in 2019 as compared to 2018 and intends to use existing cash and investments, cash flows from operations and, as needed, borrowings under its existing credit facilities to fund its repurchases under its share repurchase program. The Company received $30 million and $35 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan during the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $676 million as of June 29, 2019. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments are generated from foreign operations, with $421 million held by foreign subsidiaries at June 29, 2019, of which $256 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The Company believes it has sufficient levels of cash flow and access to its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S. These cash requirements are managed by the Company’s cash flow from operations, its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and the use of the Company’s revolving credit facility. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that the Company’s financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. The Company has conducted a post-tax reform evaluation of its capital allocation strategy and the Company is currently planning to use its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash flow from operations and available debt capacity to repurchase up to $4 billion of the Company’s common stock over the next two years. The Company is currently planning to increase its outstanding debt balances up to approximately 2.5 times the Company’s net debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio to fund a significant portion of these share repurchases. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it will provide income taxes on all future foreign earnings and reverse its historical assertion that its foreign earnings were 39 permanently invested. However, the Company will continue to be permanently reinvested in relation to the cumulative historical outside basis difference that is not related to the unremitted earnings. There have been no other significant changes to the Company’s financial position. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of June 29, 2019 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2019, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Company’s ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company’s business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Company’s costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation, business combinations and asset acquisitions and valuation of contingent consideration. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Company’s most critical accounting policies for the six months ended June 29, 2019. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the six months ended June 29, 2019. New Accounting Pronouncements Please refer to Note 14, Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments, in the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Certain of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the information incorporated by reference herein, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to future results and events, including any statements regarding, among other items, anticipated trends or growth in the Company’s business, including, but not limited to, the impact of new or proposed tariff or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the impact of foreign currency translation on financial results; development of products by acquired businesses; the growth rate of sales and research and development expenses; the impact of costs associated with developing new technologies and bringing these new technologies to market; the impact of new product launches and the associated costs, such as the amortization expense related to software platforms; geographic sales mix of business; development of products by acquired businesses and the amount of contingent payments to the sellers of an acquired business; anticipated expenses, including interest expense, capitalized software costs and effective tax rates; the impact of the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; the impact and outcome of the Company’s various ongoing tax audit examinations; the achievement of contractual milestones to preserve foreign tax rates; the impact and outcome of litigation matters; the impact of the loss of intellectual property protection; the impact of new accounting standards and pronouncements; the adequacy of the Company’s supply chain and manufacturing capabilities and facilities; the impact of regulatory compliance; the Company’s expected cash flow, borrowing capacity, debt repayment and refinancing; the Company’s ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, service debt, repay outstanding lines of credit, make authorized share repurchases, fund potential acquisitions and pay any adverse litigation or tax audit liabilities, particularly in the U.S.; future impairment charges; the Company’s contributions to defined benefit plans; the Company’s expectations regarding changes to its financial position; compliance with applicable environmental laws; and the impact of recent acquisitions on sales and earnings. Many of these statements appear, in particular, under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of the words “feels”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “expects”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “intends”, “suggests”, “appears”, “estimates”, “projects”, “should” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: • Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Company’s future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. • Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of new or proposed tariff or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the U.K. voting to exit the European Union as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company’s ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Company’s products among the Company’s customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Company’s products; and the Company’s ability to sustain and enhance service. • Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company’s competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Company’s expectations. • Increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company’s products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. 41 • Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. • The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective rates. Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of June 29, 2019, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $421 million out of $676 million and $471 million out of $1,735 million, respectively, of the Company’s total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $256 million out of $676 million and $251 million out of $1,735 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of June 29, 2019, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of June 29, 2019 would decrease by approximately $26 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. There have been no other material changes in the Company’s market risk during the six months ended June 29, 2019. For information regarding the Company’s market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 29, 2019 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. 42 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 29, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Company’s legal proceedings during the three months ended June 29, 2019 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of June 29, 2019 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K/A. Note, however, the discussion under the subheading “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

(2) In January 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. 43 Item 6: Exhibits Exhibit Number Description of Document 31.1 Chief Executive Officer Certification Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 31.2 Chief Financial Officer Certification Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 32.1 Chief Executive Officer Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC TM  and together with HPLC, referred to as LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (LC-MS) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as proteomics), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. These instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Companys instruments, as well as other manufacturers instruments. The Companys interim fiscal quarter typically ends on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter. Since the Companys fiscal year end is December 31, the first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or less than thirteen complete weeks. The Companys first fiscal quarters for 2019 and 2018 ended on March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. It is managements opinion that the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which are normal and recurring) that are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 1, 2019. Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency of each of the Companys foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency of its country of domicile, except for the Companys subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and the Cayman Islands, where the underlying transactional cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the respective local currency of domicile. The functional currency of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Cayman Islands subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, based on the respective entitys cash flows. For most of the Companys foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. 8 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, while investments with longer maturities are classified as investments. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $411 million out of $1,167 million and $471 million out of $1,735 million, respectively, of the Companys total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $263 million out of $1,167 million and $251 million out of $1,735 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company has very limited use of rebates and other cash considerations payable to customers and, as a result, the transaction price determination does not have any material variable consideration. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number of factors, including historical experience and the customers credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged against the allowance when the Company determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. The following is a summary of the activity of the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in thousands): Allowance for Doubtful Accounts March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Fair Value Measurements In accordance with the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures, certain of the Companys assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable data, such as quoted prices in active markets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 9 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) The following table represents the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 30, 2019 (in thousands): Assets: U.S. Treasury securities Foreign government securities Corporate debt securities Time deposits Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets Foreign currency exchange contracts Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements Total Liabilities: Contingent consideration Foreign currency exchange contracts Total The following table represents the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Assets: U.S. Treasury securities Foreign government securities Corporate debt securities Time deposits Waters 401(k) Restoration Plan assets Foreign currency exchange contracts Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements Total Liabilities: Contingent consideration Foreign currency exchange contracts Total 10 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) Fair Value of 401(k) Restoration Plan Assets The 401(k) Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined contribution plan and the assets were held in registered mutual funds and have been classified as Level 1. The fair values of the assets in the plan are determined through market and observable sources from daily quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents, Investments, Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements The fair values of the Companys cash equivalents, investments and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined through market and observable sources and have been classified as Level 2. These assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, typically utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services use many inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validates the prices provided by third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. Fair Value of Contingent Consideration The fair value of the Companys liability for contingent consideration relates to earnout payments in connection with the July 2014 acquisition of Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. and is determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model, which uses significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the results of operations. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future earnout payments is based on several factors, including the estimated future results and a discount rate that reflects both the likelihood of achieving the estimated future results and the Companys creditworthiness. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. Although there is no contractual limit, the fair value of future contingent consideration payments was estimated to be $3 million and $2 million at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, based on the Companys best estimate, as the earnout is based on future sales of certain products, some of which are currently in development, through 2034. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The Companys accounts receivable, accounts payable and variable interest rate debt are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of the Companys fixed interest rate debt was $510 million at both March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The fair value of the Companys fixed interest rate debt was estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company. The fair value of the Companys fixed interest rate debt was estimated to be $508 million and $502 million at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, using Level 2 inputs. Derivative Transactions The Company is a global company that operates in over 35 countries and, as a result, the Companys net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and balance sheet amounts are significantly impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to currency price risk on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when it translates its non-U.S. dollar foreign subsidiaries financial statements into U.S. dollars, and when any of the Companys subsidiaries purchase or sell products or services in a currency other than its own currency. The Companys principal strategies in managing exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are to (1) naturally hedge the foreign-currency-denominated liabilities on the Companys balance sheet against corresponding assets of the same currency, such that any changes in liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are typically offset by corresponding changes in assets and (2) mitigate foreign exchange risk exposure of international operations by hedging the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. The Company presents the derivative transactions in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. 11 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company does not specifically enter into any derivatives that hedge foreign-currency-denominated operating assets, liabilities or commitments on its balance sheet, other than a portion of certain third-party accounts receivable and accounts payable, and the Companys net worldwide intercompany receivables and payables, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Company periodically aggregates its net worldwide balances by currency and then enters into foreign currency exchange contracts that mature within 90 days to hedge a portion of the remaining balance to minimize some of the Companys currency price risk exposure. The foreign currency exchange contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Interest Rate Cross-Currency Swap Agreements In 2018, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative that relates to changes in the foreign currency spot rate are recorded in the currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income and remain in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders equity until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign operation. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreement is recorded in interest income in the statement of operations. The Companys foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate cross-currency swap agreements included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): Foreign currency exchange contracts: Other current assets Other current liabilities Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Other assets Accumulated other comprehensive income The following is a summary of the activity included in the statements of comprehensive income related to the foreign currency exchange contracts (in thousands): Foreign currency exchange contracts: Realized (losses) gains on closed contracts Unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts Cumulative net pre-tax (losses) gains Interest rate cross-currency swap agreements: Interest earned Unrealized gains on contracts In April 2019, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of $110 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. 12 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) Stockholders Equity In January 2019, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 3.3 million and 1.3 million shares of the Companys outstanding common stock at a cost of $747 million and $275 million, respectively, under the January 2019 authorization and other previously announced programs. As of March 30, 2019, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 2.5 million shares at a cost of $598 million under the January 2019 repurchase program and had a total of $3.4 billion authorized for future repurchases. In addition, the Company repurchased $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions. As of March 30, 2019, the Company accrued $25 million as a result of treasury stock purchases that were settled in the second quarter of 2019. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the accrued warranty liability is based on historical information, such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly. The following is a summary of the activity of the Companys accrued warranty liability for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in thousands): Accrued warranty liability: March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Restructuring and Other Charges In January 2019, the Company made organizational changes to better align our resources with our growth and innovation strategies, resulting in a worldwide workforce reduction, impacting 1% of the Companys employees. The Company recorded $8 million of severance and related costs during 2019. 2 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company generally enters into contracts that include a combination of products and services. Revenue is allocated to distinct performance obligations and is recognized net of allowances for returns and discounts. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time control of the product transfers to the customer. In substantially all of the Companys arrangements, title of the product transfers at shipping point and, as a result, the Company determined control transfers at the point of shipment. In more limited cases, there are destination-based shipping terms and, thus, control is deemed to transfer when the products arrive at the customer site. All incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that would have been recognized is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. In situations where the control of the goods transfers prior to the completion of the Companys obligation to 13 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) ship the products to its customers, the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the shipping services as a fulfillment cost. Accordingly, such costs are recognized when control of the related goods is transferred to the customer. In more rare situations, the Company has revenue associated with products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria and the related revenue is not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria are satisfied. The Company elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions and collected by the Company from a customer. Generally, the Companys contracts for products include a performance obligation related to installation. The Company has determined that the installation represents a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized separately upon the completion of installation. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the installation service based on the standalone selling price of the product and the service, which requires judgment. The Company determines relative standalone selling price of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates and estimated installation hours. In developing these estimates, the Company considers past history, competition, billing rates of current services and other factors. The Company has sales from standalone software, which is included in instrument systems revenue. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which the Company has determined are distinct performance obligations. The Company determines the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Companys performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. Payment terms and conditions vary among the Companys revenue streams, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of product shipment. Prior to providing payment terms to customers, an evaluation of the customers credit risk is performed. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and insignificant and are recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are not included in sales arrangements and, therefore, there is minimal variable consideration included in the transaction price of our products. Service revenue includes (i) service and software maintenance contracts and (ii) service calls (time and materials). Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. The amount of the service and software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the maintenance service period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects the Companys performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. The Companys deferred revenue liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance, prior to transfer of control of the instrument. The Company records deferred revenue primarily related to its service contracts, where consideration is billable at the beginning of the service period. The following is a summary of the activity of the Companys deferred revenue and customer advances for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in thousands): Balance at the beginning of the period Recognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period Revenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized Balance at the end of the period The Company classified $39 million of deferred revenue and customer advances in other long-term liabilities at both March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 14 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) The amount of deferred revenue and customer advances equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period presented. Such amounts are expected to be recognized in the future as follows (in thousands): Deferred revenue and customer advances expected to be recognized in: One year or less 13-24 months 25 months and beyond Total 3 Marketable Securities The Companys marketable securities within cash equivalents and investments included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (in thousands): U.S. Treasury securities Foreign government securities Corporate debt securities Time deposits Total Amounts included in: Cash equivalents Investments Total U.S. Treasury securities Foreign government securities Corporate debt securities Time deposits Total Amounts included in: Cash equivalents Investments Total 15 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) The estimated fair value of marketable debt securities by maturity date is as follows (in thousands): Due in one year or less Due after one year through three years Total 4 Inventories Inventories are classified as follows (in thousands): Raw materials Work in progress Finished goods Total inventories 5 Goodwill and Other Intangibles The carrying amount of goodwill was $357 million and $356 million at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. During the three months ended March 30, 2019, the effect of foreign currency translation increased goodwill by $1 million. The Companys intangible assets included in the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows (dollars in thousands): Capitalized software Purchased intangibles Trademarks and IPR&D Licenses Patents and other intangibles Total The gross carrying value of intangible assets and accumulated amortization for intangible assets decreased by $7 million and $5 million, respectively, in the three months ended March 30, 2019 due to the effects of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $13 million for both the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018. Amortization expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $52 million per year for each of the next five years. 16 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) 6 Debt In November 2017, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the 2017 Credit Agreement) that provides for a $1.5 billion revolving facility and a $300 million term loan. The revolving facility and term loan both mature on November 30, 2022 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2017 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the alternate base rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate on such day plus 1/2 of 1% per annum and (c) the adjusted LIBO rate on such day (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 1% per annum) or the applicable 1, 2, 3 or 6 month adjusted LIBO rate or EURIBO rate for Euro-denominated loans, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 0 and 12.5 basis points for alternate base rate loans and between 80 and 112.5 basis points for LIBO rate or EURIBO rate loans. The facility fee on the 2017 Credit Agreement ranges between 7.5 and 25 basis points per annum, based on the leverage ratio, of the amount of the revolving facility commitments and the outstanding term loan. The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of both March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of $560 million of outstanding senior unsecured notes. Interest on the fixed rate senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually each year. Interest on the floating rate senior unsecured notes is payable quarterly. The Company may prepay all or some of the senior unsecured notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus the applicable make-whole amount or prepayment premium for Series H and J senior unsecured notes. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the note purchase agreement), the Company may be required to prepay the senior unsecured notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. In 2018, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with an aggregate notional value of $300 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. In April 2019, the Company entered into three-year interest rate cross-currency swap derivative agreements with a notional value of $110 million to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on a portion of its Euro-denominated net asset investments. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 17 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) The Company had the following outstanding debt at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Foreign subsidiary lines of credit Senior unsecured notes - Series B - 5.00%, due February 2020 Total notes payable and debt, current Senior unsecured notes - Series B - 5.00%, due February 2020 Senior unsecured notes - Series E - 3.97%, due March 2021 Senior unsecured notes - Series F - 3.40%, due June 2021 Senior unsecured notes - Series G - 3.92%, due June 2024 Senior unsecured notes - Series H - floating rate*, due June 2024 Senior unsecured notes - Series I - 3.13%, due May 2023 Senior unsecured notes - Series K - 3.44%, due May 2026 Credit agreement Unamortized debt issuance costs Total long-term debt Total debt * Series H senior unsecured notes bear interest at a 3-month LIBOR for that floating rate interest period plus 1.25%. As of both March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1,208 million after outstanding letters of credit. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to the senior unsecured notes and credit agreement borrowings collectively were 3.80% and 3.83% at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of March 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company and its foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of credit totaling $90 million at both March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, for the purpose of short-term borrowing and issuance of commercial guarantees. The weighted-average interest rates applicable to these short-term borrowings were 4.44% and 1.88% for March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 7 Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates are 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of March 30, 2019. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to continue to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Companys net income for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 by $4 million and $6 million, respectively, and increased the Companys net income per diluted share by $0.06 and $0.07, respectively. The Companys effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was 7.1% and 20.3%, respectively. The income tax provision includes a $7 million and $6 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2019 includes a $3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act). This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 2.9 percentage points for the three months ended March 30, 2019. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes $12 million of additional income tax expense related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act. This additional income tax expense increased the effective tax rate by 8.9 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. 18 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes, which require financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions on the presumption that all concerned tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibit any discounting of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those positions for the time value of money. The Company continues to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The following is a summary of the activity of the Companys uncertain tax positions for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in thousands): Balance at the beginning of the period Net reductions for lapse of statutes taken during the period Net additions for tax positions taken during the current period Balance at the end of the period With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to tax audit examinations in significant jurisdictions for the years ended on or before December 31, 2013. However, carryforward tax attributes that were generated in years beginning on or before January 1, 2014 may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if the attributes are utilized. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of March 30, 2019, the Company expects to record additional reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of less than $1 million within the next twelve months due to potential tax audit settlements and the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments. The Company does not expect to record any other material reductions in the measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 8 Leases The Company adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach that was applied to leases existing as of, or entered into after, January 1, 2019. The Company elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward historical assessments of (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a right-of-use lease asset and lease liabilities in the amount $100 million as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and retained earnings. Prior to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, undiscounted future minimum rents payable as of December 31, 2018 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year were as follows (in thousands): 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 and thereafter Total future minimum lease payments The Companys operating leases consist of property leases for sales, demonstration, laboratory, warehouse and office spaces, automotive leases for sales and service personnel and equipment leases, primarily used in our manufacturing and distribution operations. The lease policies described below were effective as of January 1, 2019. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company recorded the related right-of-use asset and lease liability obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term of the leases. Some of the Companys leases include rental escalation clauses, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into our determination of lease payments. A 19 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) certain number of these leases contain rent escalation clauses, either fixed or adjusted periodically for inflation of market rates, that are factored into the Companys determination of lease payments. The Company also has variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, primarily for items such as common area maintenance and real estate taxes, which are recorded as variable costs when incurred. In addition, the Companys lease agreements that contain lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for as a single lease component. The Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements of the new accounting guidance to leases with terms less than 12 months. For these leases, the Company recognizes lease payments in net income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. As of March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company does not have leases that are classified as finance leases. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to determine the present value of the lease liabilities; however, most of the leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate and, as required by the accounting guidance, the Company estimated its incremental secured borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement (or, for the leases in existence on the adoption date, the January 1, 2019 information). The Companys incremental borrowing rate reflects the estimated rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As of March 30, 2019, the Company has lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2033, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 4.8 years. Rental expense was $9 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 under the new lease accounting standard and $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 under the previous lease accounting standard. The weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of lease liabilities was 3.95%. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities in operating activities in the statement of cash flows was $9 million during the three months ended March 30, 2019. The Companys right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): Financial Statement Classification Assets: Property operating lease assets Automobile operating lease assets Equipment operating lease assets Total lease assets Liabilities: Current operating lease liabilities Long-term operating lease liabilities Total lease liabilities 20 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) Undiscounted future minimum rents payable as of March 30, 2019 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year reconcile to lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet as follows (in thousands): 2019 (remaining 9 months) 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and thereafter Total future minimum lease payments Less: amount of lease payments representing interest Present value of future minimum lease payments Less: current operating lease liabilities Long-term operating lease liabilities 9 Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains various shareholder-approved, stock-based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other types of awards (e.g. restricted stock units and performance stock units). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for stock-based compensation, which require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations, based on their grant date fair values. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line attribution method. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest; therefore, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, if the Company employs different assumptions in the application of these standards, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 include the following stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock unit awards and the employee stock purchase plan (in thousands): Cost of sales Selling and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Total stock-based compensation Stock Options In determining the fair value of the stock options, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected stock option lives. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock options granted during the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 are as follows: 21 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) Options Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Option Fair Values Options issued in thousands Risk-free interest rate Expected life in years Expected volatility Expected dividends Weighted-Average Exercise Price and Fair Value of Options on the Date of Grant Exercise price Fair value The following table summarizes stock option activity for the plans for the three months ended March 30, 2019 (in thousands, except per share data): Outstanding at December 31, 2018 Granted Exercised Outstanding at March 30, 2019 Restricted Stock During the three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company granted five thousand shares of restricted stock. The weighted-average fair value per share of these awards on the grant date was $183.41. Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the unvested restricted stock unit award activity for the three months ended March 30, 2019 (in thousands, except per share data): Unvested at December 31, 2018 Granted Vested Forfeited Unvested at March 30, 2019 Restricted stock units are generally granted annually in February and vest in equal annual installments over a five-year period. 22 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) Performance Stock Units The Companys performance stock units are equity compensation awards with a market vesting condition based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the TSR of the components of the S&P Health Care Index. TSR is the change in value of a stock price over time, including the reinvestment of dividends. The vesting schedule ranges from 0% to 200% of the target shares awarded. In determining the fair value of the performance stock units, the Company makes a variety of assumptions and estimates, including volatility measures, expected yields and expected terms. The fair value of each performance stock unit grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses implied volatility on its publicly-traded options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility is the most appropriate indicator of expected volatility because it is generally reflective of historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The expected life assumption for grants is based on the performance period of the underlying performance stock units. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input to the Monte Carlo simulation model. The correlation coefficient is used to model the way in which each company in the S&P Health Care Index tends to move in relation to each other during the performance period. The relevant data used to determine the value of the performance stock units granted during the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 are as follows: Performance Stock Units Issued and Significant Assumptions Used to Estimate Fair Values Performance stock units issued (in thousands) Risk-free interest rate Expected life in years Expected volatility Average volatility of peer companies Correlation coefficient Expected dividends The following table summarizes the unvested performance stock unit award activity for the three months ended March 30, 2019 (in thousands, except per share data): Unvested at December 31, 2018 Granted Unvested at March 30, 2019 23 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) 10 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted EPS calculations are detailed as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Net income per basic common share Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities Net income per diluted common share Net income per basic common share Effect of dilutive stock option, restricted stock, performance stock unit and restricted stock unit securities Net income per diluted common share For the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company had 0.1 million and 0.3 million stock options that were antidilutive, respectively, due to having higher exercise prices than the Companys average stock price during the period. These securities were not included in the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of dilutive securities was calculated using the treasury stock method. 11 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are detailed as follows (in thousands): Balance at December 31, 2018 Other comprehensive income, net of tax Balance at March 30, 2019 24 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) 12 Retirement Plans The Company sponsors various retirement plans. The components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in other (expense) income in the consolidated statements of operations. The summary of the components of net periodic pension costs for the plans for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 is as follows (in thousands): Service cost Interest cost Expected return on plan assets Net amortization: Prior service credit Net actuarial loss Net periodic pension cost (benefit) In 2018, the Company terminated and settled its frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan, the Waters Retirement Plan, by making lump-sum cash payments and purchasing annuity contracts for participants to permanently extinguish the pension plans obligations. The Company also anticipates that it will settle the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan during 2019, and the Company may incur pension accounting charges in connection with the termination of this plan. During fiscal year 2019, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to the Companys defined benefit plans. 13 Business Segment Information The Companys business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. The Companys two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. 25 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) Net sales for the Companys products and services are as follows for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in thousands): Product net sales: Waters instrument systems Chemistry consumables TA instrument systems Total product sales Service net sales: Waters service TA service Total service sales Total net sales Net sales are attributable to geographic areas based on the region of destination.

This new comprehensive lease standard amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases. The core principle of the new guidance requires lessees to present the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on their balance sheets. This guidance was effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company has adopted this standard using a modified retrospective transition approach to be applied to leases existing as of, or entered into after, January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the Companys balance sheet by recording a right-of-use lease asset and lease liabilities in the amount $100 million as of January 1, 2019; however, it did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and retained earnings. In March 2017, accounting guidance was issued to amend the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amortization period for certain callable debt securities was shortened to end at the earliest call date. This guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2018, accounting guidance was issued to address the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Current accounting guidance requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates with the effect recorded in income from continuing operations, even if the related tax effects were originally recognized in other comprehensive income, the new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. This guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the recognition of credit losses related to financial assets, such as debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and other financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash. Current guidance requires the recognition of a credit loss when it is considered probable that a loss event has occurred. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based upon relevant information, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the asset. As such, expected credit losses may be recognized sooner under the new guidance due to the broader range of information that will be required to determine credit loss estimates. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model used for debt securities classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost, the new guidance requires the total unrealized loss to be bifurcated into its credit and non-credit 27 CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  (Continued) components. Any expected credit losses or subsequent recoveries will be recognized in earnings and any changes not considered credit related will continue to be recognized within other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company currently does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, accounting guidance was issued that simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company currently does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirements identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2018, accounting guidance was issued that modifies the disclosure requirements of retirement benefit plans. The amendments remove disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarify the specific requirements of disclosure and add disclosure requirement identified as relevant. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 28 Item 2: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Company has two operating segments: Waters TM and TA TM . Waters products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC TM  and together with HPLC, referred to as LC), mass spectrometry (MS) and precision chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Companys products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers. These customers use the Companys products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products. The Companys operating results are as follows for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Revenues: Product sales Service sales Total net sales Costs and operating expenses: Cost of sales Selling and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Purchased intangibles amortization Litigation settlement Operating income Operating income as a % of sales Other (expense) income Interest expense, net Income before income taxes Provision for income taxes Net income Net income per diluted common share In the first quarter of 2019, the Companys net sales decreased 3% as compared to the first quarter of 2018, with foreign currency translation reducing sales growth by 3%. Unless otherwise noted, sales growth or decline percentages are presented as compared with the same period in the prior year. Instrument system sales decreased 8% in the quarter, as a result of weaker demand for our products by our customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic impacts relating to Brexit and governmental policy changes in certain regions. Foreign currency translation decreased instrument system sales by 2%. Recurring revenues (combined sales of precision chemistry consumables and services) increased 1% in the quarter, as a result of a larger installed base of customers and higher billing demand for service sales. In the first quarter of 2019, recurring revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 3% as well as one less calendar day as compared to the first quarter of 2018. Geographically, the Companys sales were flat in Asia and the Americas, and decreased 12% in Europe, with the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacting sales growth in Europe and Asia by 7% and 2%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, China sales declined 4%, primarily as a result of economic uncertainty stemming from governmental policy in our food and pharmaceutical markets. Sales in the U.S. increased 2% and sales in Asia Other increased 5%, despite Indias sales declining 1%. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted Indias sales growth by 7% in the first quarter of 2019. 29 During the first quarter of 2019, sales to pharmaceutical customers declined 4%, with the effect of foreign currency translation decreasing sales growth by 4%, primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign currency translation in Europe and India of 8% and 10%, respectively. Combined sales to industrial customers, which include material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, declined 4% and were driven by a 9% decline in TA sales. During the first quarter of 2019, combined sales to academic and governmental customers increased 2%, which was driven by sales growth in the U.S. and Europe. Operating income was $121 million in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of 16% as compared to the first quarter of 2018. This decrease was primarily a result of the effect of lower sales volumes in the first quarter of 2019. Operating income in the first quarter of 2019 also included $8 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. In addition, operating income in the first quarter of 2018 included the benefit of a $2 million litigation settlement. The Company generated $176 million of net cash flows from operations in the first quarter of both 2019 and 2018. Cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization of $26 million and $16 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The first quarter of 2019 includes $7 million of capital expenditures related to the expansion of the Companys precision chemistry consumable operations in the U.S. The Company has incurred $26 million on this facility through the end of the first quarter of 2019 and anticipates spending a total of $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. In January 2019, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. During the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased $747 million and $275 million of the Companys outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and investment levels and debt borrowing capacity, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Companys sales and profits. Results of Operations Sales by Geography Geographic sales information is presented below for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Net Sales: Asia: China Japan Asia Other Total Asia Americas: United States Americas Other Total Americas Europe Total net sales In the first quarter of 2019, sales decreased in China primarily as a result of economic uncertainty caused by certain regulatory changes in our food and pharmaceutical markets. The increase in sales in Japan for the first quarter was 30 driven by TA products and services despite a 3% decrease due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Sales in the rest of Asia were driven by service revenues and LC-MS instrument systems, primarily to pharmaceutical customers. Sales growth in the U.S. was driven by recurring revenues and sales to industrial, academic and governmental customers. Sales declines in the rest of the Americas were broad-based across all product and customer classes, primarily in South America. The sales decline in Europe was primarily attributed to the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales 7% for the quarter. Net sales by customer class are presented below for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Pharmaceutical Industrial Academic and governmental Total net sales In the first quarter of 2019, the decline in sales to pharmaceutical customers was primarily due to a negative impact from the effect of foreign currency translation, which decreased sales to pharmaceutical customers by 4%, as well as a slower release of capital budgets by our customers due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions due to Brexit, particularly in Europe, and regulatory changes in our food and pharmaceutical markets in China. The decline in sales to industrial customers in the quarter is primarily due to a 9% decline in TA sales. The increase in sales to academic and governmental customers was broad-based across all product classes, with increases in the U.S. and Europe being offset by declines in other regions. Waters Products and Services Net Sales Net sales for Waters products and services are as follows for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Waters instrument systems Chemistry consumables Total Waters product sales Waters service Total Waters net sales The effect of foreign currency translation decreased Waters sales by 3% for the quarter. Precision chemistry consumables sales increased in the first quarter of 2019 on the uptake in columns and application-specific testing kits and were driven by sales in the U.S. and China primarily to pharmaceutical customers. Waters service sales benefited from increased sales of service plans and higher service demand billings to a higher installed base of customers and broad-based across all geographic regions, except in Europe, where a 7% decline in service was impacted by a 6% decrease due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Waters recurring revenues were also negatively impacted by one less calendar day and the negative impact of foreign currency translation which lowered sales by 3% in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology-based) decreased in all major geographical regions, primarily due to lower sales to pharmaceutical and industrial customers due to uncertainty caused by macroeconomic conditions relating to Brexit and other regulatory changes in certain regions. In the first quarter of 2019, Waters sales increased 1% in the Americas, were flat in Asia and decreased 10% in Europe. Within Asia, Waters sales decreased 4% in China, were flat in Japan and increased 6% in the rest of Asia. Waters sales in Europe were negatively impacted by 7% due to the effect of foreign currency translation. 31 TA Product and Services Net Sales Net sales for TA products and services are as follows for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): TA instrument systems TA service Total TA net sales The decline in TA instrument system sales in the first quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower customer demand due to the timing of the release of capital budgets by our customers and was broad-based across all TA technologies. TA service sales increased in the quarter due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased TAs sales 1% in the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, TA sales were flat in Asia and decreased 5% and 30% in the Americas and Europe, respectively. Within Asia, a 25% increase in Japan was offset by declines of 8% and 2% in China and the rest of Asia, respectively. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the first quarter of 2019 were flat as compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a change in sales mix and lower manufacturing efficiencies on lower sales volumes. Cost of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, foreign currency translation, product mix, product costs of instrument systems and amortization of software platforms. At current foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to negatively impact gross profit for the remainder of 2019. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 3% in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018. Selling and administrative expenses were impacted by higher merit compensation costs and $8 million of severance-related costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation reduced selling and administrative expenses by 5% in the first quarter of 2019. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 26.1% and 24.6% for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased 2% in the first quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of merit compensation and costs associated with new products and the development of new technology initiatives. In addition, the effect of foreign currency translation decreased research and development expenses by 2% in the quarter on the Companys U.K.-based research and development expenses, as the British pound weakened against the U.S. dollar as compared to the first quarter of 2018. Litigation Settlement In the second quarter of 2017, the Company incurred an $11 million litigation provision related to the issuance of a verdict in a patent litigation case. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company resolved the case with a final settlement that resulted in a gain of $2 million. Interest Expense, Net The decrease in net interest expense in 2019 was primarily attributable to lower interest income on lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, lower interest expense on lower outstanding debt balances and the additional interest income from the three-year U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements entered into during the second half of 2018. 32 Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures are the U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and Singapore, where the statutory tax rates are 21%, 12.5%, 19% and 17%, respectively, as of March 30, 2019. The Company has a contractual tax rate of 0% on qualifying activities in Singapore through March 2021, based upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones, which the Company expects to continue to meet. The effect of applying the contractual tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate to income from qualifying activities in Singapore increased the Companys net income for the quarter in 2019 and 2018 by $4 million and $6 million, respectively, and increased the Companys net income per diluted share by $0.06 and $0.07, respectively. The Companys effective tax rate for the 2019 and 2018 quarters was 7.1% and 20.3%, respectively. The income tax provision includes a $7 million and $6 million income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the 2019 quarter includes a $3 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain regulations relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act). This income tax benefit decreased the effective tax rate by 2.9 percentage points for the 2019 quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2018 quarter includes $12 million of additional income tax expense related to the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings taxed in December 2017 under the toll charge of the 2017 Tax Act. This additional income tax expense increased the effective tax rate by 8.9 percentage points for the 2018 quarter. The remaining differences between the effective tax rates can primarily be attributed to differences in the proportionate amounts of pre-tax income recognized in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Net income Depreciation and amortization Stock-based compensation Deferred income taxes Change in accounts receivable Change in inventories Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities Change in deferred revenue and customer advances Effect of the 2017 Tax Act Other changes Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by investing activities Net cash used in financing activities Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents Cash Flow from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $176 million during both the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the changes in net income: The changes in accounts receivable were primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and timing of sales. Days sales outstanding increased to 88 days at March 30, 2019 as compared to 85 days at March 31, 2018. 33 The changes in inventory were primarily attributable to anticipated annual increases in sales volumes, as well as new product launches and a build of safety stock inventory in advance of the Brexit decision. The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities were a result of the timing of payments to vendors, as well as the annual payment of management incentive compensation. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances results from annual increases in new service contracts as a higher installed base of customers renew annual service contracts. Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures, prepaid income taxes and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $434 million in the three months ended March 30, 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities that totaled $896 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $26 million and $16 million in the first three months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. In February 2018, the Companys Board of Directors approved expanding its precision chemistry consumable manufacturing operations in the U.S. The Company anticipates spending an estimated $215 million to build and equip this new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which will be paid for with existing cash and investments. The Company does not expect to issue any debt in relation to this expansion. The Company has incurred $11 million of costs associated with the construction of this facility during the first quarter of 2019, and has incurred a total of $26 million through the end of the first quarter 2019. During the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company purchased $27 million and $170 million of investments, respectively, while $486 million and $1,085 million of investments matured, respectively, and were used for financing activities described below. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Companys net debt borrowings were flat and decreased by $750 million, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reduced its outstanding debt using cash repatriated under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act). As of March 30, 2019, the Company had a total of $1,149 million in outstanding debt, which consisted of $560 million in outstanding senior unsecured notes, $300 million borrowed under a term loan and $290 million borrowed under a revolving credit facility, with both the term loan and revolving credit facilities under the credit agreement dated November 2017 (2017 Credit Agreement). As of March 30, 2019, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $1,208 million after outstanding letters of credit. As of March 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. In February 2019, certain defined terms related to the subsidiary guarantors were amended in the 2017 Credit Agreement and senior unsecured note agreements. In addition, the Company amended the senior unsecured note agreements to allow the Company to elect an increase in the permitted leverage ratio from 3.50:1 to 4.0:1, for a period of three consecutive quarters, for a material acquisition of $400 million or more. During the period of time where the leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1, the interest payable on the senior unsecured notes shall increase by 0.50%. The debt covenants in the senior unsecured note agreements were also modified to address the change in accounting guidance for leases. In 2018 and April 2019, the Company entered into $410 million of U.S.-to-Euro interest rate cross-currency swap agreements that hedge the Companys net investment in its Euro denominated net assets. As a result of entering into these agreements, the Company anticipates lowering net interest expense by approximately $12 million annually over the three-year term of the agreements. In January 2019, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available from the pre-existing program. During the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased $745 million and $275 million, respectively, of the Companys outstanding common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. In addition, the Company repurchased $8 million of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units during both the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018. The Company expects to increase its share 34 repurchase activity in 2019 as compared to 2018 and intends to use existing cash and investments, cash flows from operations and, as needed, borrowings under its existing credit facilities to fund its repurchases under its share repurchase program. The Company received $28 million and $24 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan during the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1,167 million as of March 30, 2019. The majority of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and investments are generated from foreign operations, with $411 million held by foreign subsidiaries at March 30, 2019, of which $263 million was held in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The Company believes it has sufficient levels of cash flow and access to its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest, finance potential acquisitions and continue the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S. These cash requirements are managed by the Companys cash flow from operations, its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and the use of the Companys revolving credit facility. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that the Companys financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from existing, committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. The Company has conducted a post-tax reform evaluation of its capital allocation strategy and the Company is currently planning to use its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash flow from operations and available debt capacity to repurchase up to $4 billion of the Companys common stock over the next two years. The Company is currently planning to increase its outstanding debt balances up to approximately 2.5 times the Companys net debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio to fund a significant portion of these share repurchases. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company determined that it will provide income taxes on all future foreign earnings and reverse its historical assertion that its foreign earnings were permanently invested. However, the Company will continue to be permanently reinvested in relation to the cumulative historical outside basis difference that is not related to the unremitted earnings. There have been no other significant changes to the Companys financial position. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Dividends A summary of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments is included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. The Company reviewed its contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of March 30, 2019 and determined that there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from the information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and that any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2019, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $3 million to $6 million to its defined benefit plans, excluding the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company has not paid any dividends and has no plans, at this time, to pay any dividends in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. 35 The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Companys business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Companys costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019, the Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which its financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, warranty, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, stock-based compensation, business combinations and asset acquisitions and valuation of contingent consideration. The Company reviewed its policies and determined that those policies remain the Companys most critical accounting policies for the three months ended March 30, 2019. The Company did not make any changes in those policies during the three months ended March 30, 2019.

Many of these statements appear, in particular, under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of the words feels, believes, anticipates, plans, expects, may, will, would, intends, suggests, appears, estimates, projects, should and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, including, and without limitation: 36 Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect translation of the Companys future sales, financial operating results and the condition of its non-U.S. operations, especially when a currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. Current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, particularly regarding the effect of new or proposed tariff or trade regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations; the U.K. voting to exit the European Union as well as the Chinese governments ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Companys ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile market conditions; changes in timing and demand for the Companys products among the Companys customers and various market sectors or geographies, particularly if they should reduce capital expenditures or are unable to obtain funding, as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions; the effect of mergers and acquisitions on customer demand for the Companys products; and the Companys ability to sustain and enhance service. Negative industry trends; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Companys competitors; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from customers or resulting from competition; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products; expansion of our business in developing markets; spending by certain end-markets; ability to obtain alternative sources for components and modules; and the possibility that future sales of new products related to acquisitions, which trigger contingent purchase payments, may exceed the Companys expectations. Increased regulatory burdens as the Companys business evolves, especially with respect to the United States Food and Drug Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among others, as well as regulatory, environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Companys products, completion of purchase order documentation by our customers and ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives. Risks associated with lawsuits, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. The impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates, specifically as it relates to the 2017 Tax Act in the U.S.; shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; and the outcome of and costs associated with ongoing and future tax audit examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Companys effective rates. Certain of these and other factors are discussed under the heading Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements, whether because of these factors or for other reasons. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this report. Except as required by law, the Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. Investments with maturities greater than 90 days are classified as investments, and are held primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated treasury bills and commercial paper, bank deposits and corporate debt securities. As of March 30, 2019, the Company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points across all maturities would not have a material effect on the fair market value of its portfolio. The Company is also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The Company maintains cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $411 million out of $1,167 million and $471 million out of $1,735 million, respectively, of the Companys total cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, $263 million out of $1,167 million and $251 million out of $1,735 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of March 30, 2019, the Company had no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles. 37 Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year-end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and investments held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of March 30, 2019 would decrease by approximately $26 million, of which the majority would be recorded to foreign currency translation in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. There have been no other material changes in the Companys market risk during the three months ended March 30, 2019. For information regarding the Companys market risk, refer to Item 7A of Part II of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Item 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer (principal executive officer and principal financial officer), with the participation of management, evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 30, 2019 (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure and (2) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting No change was identified in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 30, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Part II: Other Information Item 1: Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes in the Companys legal proceedings during the three months ended March 30, 2019 as described in Item 3 of Part I of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Item 1A: Risk Factors Information regarding risk factors of the Company is set forth under the heading Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. The Company reviewed its risk factors as of March 30, 2019 and determined that there were no material changes from the ones set forth in the Form 10-K. Note, however, the discussion under the subheading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and operating results. Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer The following table provides information about purchases by the Company during the three months ended March 30, 2019 of equity securities registered by the Company under the Exchange Act (in thousands, except per share data): 38 Period January 1, 2019 to January 26, 2019 January 27, 2019 to February 23, 2019 February 24, 2019 to March 30, 2019 Total The Company repurchased 34 thousand shares of common stock at a cost of $8 million related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the three months ended March 30, 2019. In January 2019, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions over a two-year period. This new program replaced the remaining amounts available under the pre-existing authorization. 39 Item 6: Exhibits Exhibit Number Description of Document This exhibit shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any filing, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates it by reference. 40 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
