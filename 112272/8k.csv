A related person transaction between Mr. Saperstein and the Company is disclosed in the Company’s proxy statement for its 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders under “Certain Transactions” on page 46 (available at https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000114036123016930/ny20005681x1_def14a.htm ). On October 25, 2023, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, t he Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) approved a one-time staking award (the “Awards”) to each of Mr. Pick, Mr. Saperstein and Mr. Simkowitz. The Committee determined that granting the Awards to each of our incoming Chief Executive Officer and Co-Presidents is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as the Company transitions from 14 years of exceptional leadership by Mr. Gorman. The Committee granted the Awards in acknowledgment of the Board’s assessment of the criticality to the continued success of Morgan Stanley of ensuring that each executive continues their outstanding leadership in their new roles at the Company. The Awards are equity-based, and are designed to reinforce the executive’s accountability for the Company’s future financial goals and directly tie compensation outcomes to shareholder-based value creation over a multi-year period in a balanced manner that does not encourage imprudent risk taking, while incentivizing leadership continuity. Each Award consists of 60% performance stock units (“PSUs”) with a performance period of 2024-2026 that convert to shares in 2027 and 40% restricted-stock units (“RSUs”) that vest and convert to shares on January 25, 2027. Given a recent review of the Company’s PSU program in 2022 with the Committee’s independent compensation consultant and the Company’s Chief Risk Officer and resulting updates to the program, the Committee determined that the program’s equal weighting of absolute and relative ROTCE performance metrics, three-year performance period and performance grid were appropriate for the PSU portion of the Award in order to maintain alignment with the Company’s financial and strategic objectives. The Awards do not contain a provision for vesting upon achieving retirement eligibility, are subject to cancellation for resignation or competitive activity, and are subject to the Company’s accounting restatement clawback policy and Equity Ownership Commitment. Each Award has a grant date fair value of $20 million, which is approximately the average of the annual variable compensation of the three executives. The aggregate number of PSUs and RSUs granted was determined by dividing the Award grant value by the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. These Awards are not part of the executives’ regular annual compensation and will not be awarded on a regular basis. The above summary of the Awards is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable award certificate (forms of which are attached as Exhibit 10.33 to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and Exhibit 10.22 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 ).

We have a global diversified business with a leading client franchise. Thanks to James’ excellent leadership, our Firm is now well-positioned to succeed across market cycles, and I am excited about the opportunities for future growth.

Pre-tax income was $1.2 billion compared to $1.6 billion a year ago. 7 Investment Banking revenues down 27% compared to a year ago: • Advisory revenues decreased driven by fewer completed M&A transactions. • Equity underwriting revenues increased primarily driven by higher block offerings, partially offset by lower revenues from IPOs. • Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily driven by lower event-driven non-investment grade activity. Equity net revenues up 2% compared to a year ago: • Equity net revenues reflected solid results across businesses. Mark-to-market gains on business-related investments compared to losses a year ago were offset by prime brokerage due to changes in the mix of client balances. Fixed Income net revenues down 11% compared to a year ago: • Fixed Income net revenues decreased as lower client activity and less favorable market conditions drove declines in rates and foreign exchange. These declines were partially offset by constructive trading environments in commodities, as well as agency and non-agency trading.

Financial, statistical and business-related information, as well as information regarding business and segment trends, is included in the financial supplement. Both the earnings release and the financial supplement are available online in the Investor Relations section at www.morganstanley.com . NOTICE: The information provided herein and in the financial supplement, including information provided on the Firm’s earnings conference calls, may include certain non-GAAP financial measures. The definition of such measures or reconciliation of such measures to the comparable U.S. GAAP figures are included in this earnings release and the financial supplement, both of which are available on www.morganstanley.com . This earnings release may contain forward-looking statements, including the attainment of certain financial and other targets, objectives and goals. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management’s current estimates, projections, expectations, assumptions, interpretations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the Firm, please see “Forward-Looking Statements” preceding Part I, Item 1, “Competition” and “Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1, “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk” in Part II, Item 7A in the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and other items throughout the Form 10-K, the Firm’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Current Reports on Form 8-K, including any amendments thereto. 1 Includes preferred dividends related to the calculation of earnings per share of $146 million and $138 million for the third quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 2 The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a “non-GAAP financial measure” as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition, operating results, or capital adequacy. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. 3 Our earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and other communications may also include certain metrics which we believe to be useful to us, analysts, investors, and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results. 4 Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy. The calculation of return on average tangible common equity represents full year or annualized net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity, also a non-GAAP financial measure, represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction . 5 The Firm expense efficiency ratio represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Firm results include pre-tax integration-related expenses of $68 million, of which $43 million is reported in the Wealth Management business segment and $25 million is reported in the Investment Management business segment. 6 Pre-tax margin represents income before provision for income taxes divided by net revenues. 7 Pre-tax income represents income before provision for income taxes. 8 Wealth Management fee-based client assets represent the amount of assets in client accounts where the basis of payment for services is a fee calculated on those assets. 9 Wealth Management fee-based asset flows include net new fee-based assets (including asset acquisitions), net account transfers, dividends, interest, and client fees, and exclude institutional cash management-related activity. 10 Wealth Management net new assets represent client inflows, including dividends and interest, and asset acquisitions, less client outflows, and exclude activity from business combinations/divestitures and the impact of fees and commissions. 11 AUM is defined as assets under management. 12 Long-term net flows include the Equity, Fixed Income and Alternative and Solutions asset classes and excludes the Liquidity and Overlay Services asset class. 13 Transactional revenues include investment banking, trading, and commissions and fee revenues. 14 Capital ratios are estimates as of the press release date, October 18, 2023. 15 CET1 capital is defined as Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The Firm’s risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk risk ‐ weighted assets (RWAs) (the “Standardized Approach”) and (ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the “Advanced Approach”). For information on the calculation of regulatory capital and ratios, and associated regulatory requirements, please refer to ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Regulatory Requirements"" in the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). 16 The Tier 1 leverage ratio is a leverage-based capital requirement that measures the Firm’s leverage.

From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a “non-GAAP financial measure” as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing, our financial condition, operating results, or prospective regulatory capital requirements. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. In addition to the following notes, please also refer to the Firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). (b) The following are considered non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of operating performance and capital adequacy. These measures are calculated as follows: - The return on average tangible common equity represents annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. - Segment return on average common equity and return on average tangible common equity represent full year net income or annualized net income for the quarter applicable to Morgan Stanley for each segment, less preferred dividend segment allocation, divided by average common equity and average tangible common equity for each respective segment. The segment adjustments to common equity to derive segment average tangible common equity are generally set at the beginning of the year, and will remain fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (e.g., acquisition or disposition). - Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of certain mortgage servicing rights deduction. - Tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding. - Net revenues excluding DCP represents net revenues adjusted for the impact of mark-to-market gains/losses on economic hedges associated with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans. - Compensation expense excluding DCP represents compensation adjusted for the impact related to certain deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance. 12 Definitions of Performance Metrics and Terms Our earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and other communications may also include certain metrics which we believe to be useful to us, analysts, investors and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results. Page 1: (a) Provision for credit losses represents the provision for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded lending commitments. (b) Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley represents net income, less net income applicable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests. (c) Earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to Morgan Stanley, less preferred dividends. Page 2: (a) The return on average common equity represents annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. (b) Book value per common share represents common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding. (c) Tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by period end common shares outstanding. (d) Pre-tax profit margin percentages represent income before provision for income taxes as percentages of net revenues. (e) The Firm expense efficiency ratio represents total non‐interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Page 3: (a) Liquidity Resources, which are primarily held within the Parent and its major operating subsidiaries, are comprised of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) and cash deposits with banks (""Liquidity Resources""). The total amount of Liquidity Resources is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. Average Liquidity Resources represents the average daily balance for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. (b) The Firm's goodwill and intangible balances utilized in the calculation of tangible common equity are net of certain mortgage servicing rights deduction. (c) U.S. Bank refers to the Firm's U.S. Bank operating subsidiaries Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association, and excludes balances between Bank subsidiaries, as well as deposits from the Parent and affiliates. (d) Firmwide regional revenues reflect the Firm's consolidated net revenues on a managed basis. Further discussion regarding the geographic methodology for net revenues is disclosed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Firm's 2022 Form 10-K. Page 4: (a) The Firm's attribution of average common equity to the business segments is based on the Required Capital Framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. This framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with the Firm's regulatory capital to ensure that the Firm maintains an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The Required Capital Framework is based on the Firm's regulatory capital requirements. The Firm defines the difference between its total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to its business segments as Parent common equity. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of the year, and will remain fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (e.g., acquisition or disposition). The Firm continues to evaluate its Required Capital Framework with respect to the impact of evolving regulatory requirements, as appropriate. For further discussion of the framework, refer to ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Regulatory Requirements"" in the Firm’s 2022 Form 10‐K. (b) The Firm's risk‐based capital ratios are computed under each of the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk risk‐weighted assets (RWAs) (the “Standardized Approach”) and (ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the “Advanced Approach”). For information on the calculation of regulatory capital and ratios, and associated regulatory requirements, please refer to ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Regulatory Requirements"" in the Firm’s 2022 Form 10‐K. (c) Supplementary leverage ratio represents Tier 1 capital divided by the total supplementary leverage exposure. Page 5: (a) Institutional Securities Equity and Fixed income net revenues include trading, net interest income (interest income less interest expense), asset management, commissions and fees, investments and other revenues which are directly attributable to those businesses. (b) Pre-tax profit margin percentages represent income before provision for income taxes as percentages of net revenues. (c) VaR represents the unrealized loss in portfolio value that one would not expect to exceed, on average, more than five times every one hundred trading days in the Firm's trading positions if the portfolio were held constant for a one-day period. Further discussion of the calculation of VaR and the limitations of the Firm's VaR methodology, is disclosed in ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk"" included in the Firm's 2022 Form 10-K. Page 6: (a) Transactional revenues for the Wealth Management segment includes investment banking, trading, and commissions and fee revenues. (b) Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. (c) Other revenues for the Wealth Management segment includes investments and other revenues. (d) Pre-tax profit margin percentages represent income before provision for income taxes as percentages of net revenues. 13 Definitions of Performance Metrics and Terms Our earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and other communications may also include certain metrics which we believe to be useful to us, analysts, investors and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results. Page 7: (a) Client assets represent those for which Wealth Management is providing services including financial advisor-led brokerage, custody, administrative and investment advisory services; self-directed brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace services, including stock plan administration, and retirement plan services.

(c) Margin and other lending represents margin lending arrangements, which allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities and other lending which includes non‐purpose securities-based lending on non‐bank entities. (d) Deposits reflect liabilities sourced from Wealth Management clients and other sources of funding on the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. Deposits include sweep deposit programs, savings and other, and time deposits. (e) Annualized weighted average cost of deposits represents the total annualized weighted average cost of the various deposit products, excluding the effect of related hedging derivatives. The period end cost of deposits is based upon balances and rates as of September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. The period average is based on both daily average deposit balances and rates for the period. (f) Advisor-led client assets represent client assets in accounts that have a Wealth Management representative assigned. (g) Fee‐based client assets represent the amount of assets in client accounts where the basis of payment for services is a fee calculated on those assets. (h) Fee-based asset flows include net new fee-based assets (including asset acquisitions), net account transfers, dividends, interest and client fees, and exclude institutional cash management related activity. For a description of the Inflows and Outflows included in Fee-based asset flows, see Fee-based client assets in the 2022 Form 10-K. (i) Self-directed client assets represent active accounts which are not advisor led. Active accounts are defined as having at least $25 in assets. (j) Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) represent the total self-directed trades in a period divided by the number of trading days during that period. (k) Self-directed households represent the total number of households that include at least one account with self-directed client assets.

Asset management and related fees represents Asset management as reported on the Firm’s consolidated income statement. (b) Performance-based income and other includes performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, gains and losses from investments, gains and losses from hedges on seed capital and certain employee deferred compensation plans, net interest, and other revenues. Performance-based income and other represents investments, investment banking, trading, net interest and other revenues as reported on the Firm’s consolidated income statement. (c) Pre-tax profit margin percentages represent income before provision for income taxes as percentages of net revenues. Page 9: (a) Investment Management Alternatives and Solutions asset class includes products in Fund of Funds, Real Estate, Private Equity and Credit strategies, Multi‐Asset portfolios, as well as Custom Separate Account portfolios.

(d) Institutional Securities Lending Commitments principally include Corporate lending activity. 14 Supplemental Quantitative Details and Calculations Page 1: (1) The following sets forth the net revenue impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on investments associated with DCP and compensation expense impact related to DCP: 3Q23 2Q23 3Q22 3Q23 YTD 3Q22 YTD Net revenues $ 13,273 $ 13,457 $ 12,986 $ 41,247 $ 40,919 Adjustment for mark-to-market on DCP 202 (114 ) 236 (65 ) 1,392 Adjusted Net revenues - non-GAAP $ 13,475 $ 13,343 $ 13,222 $ 41,182 $ 42,311 Compensation expense $ 5,935 $ 6,262 $ 5,614 $ 18,607 $ 17,438 Adjustment for mark-to-market on DCP 57 (178 ) 119 (314 ) 905 Adjusted Compensation expense - non-GAAP $ 5,992 $ 6,084 $ 5,733 $ 18,293 $ 18,343 - Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. - The Firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under these deferred cash-based compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in Net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the Firm’s investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to Income before provision for income taxes for the Firm in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses.

Both the earnings release and the financial supplement are available online in the Investor Relations section at www.morganstanley.com . NOTICE: The information provided herein and in the financial supplement, including information provided on the Firm’s earnings conference calls, may include certain non-GAAP financial measures. The definition of such measures or reconciliation of such measures to the comparable U.S. GAAP figures are included in this earnings release and the financial supplement, both of which are available on www.morganstanley.com . This earnings release may contain forward-looking statements, including the attainment of certain financial and other targets, objectives and goals. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management’s current estimates, projections, expectations, assumptions, interpretations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the Firm, please see “Forward-Looking Statements” preceding Part I, Item 1, “Competition” and “Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1, “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk” in Part II, Item 7A in the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and other items throughout the Form 10-K, the Firm’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Current Reports on Form 8-K, including any amendments thereto. 1 Includes preferred dividends related to the calculation of earnings per share of $146 million and $138 million for the third quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. 2 The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a “non-GAAP financial measure” as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition, operating results, or capital adequacy. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. 3 Our earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and other communications may also include certain metrics which we believe to be useful to us, analysts, investors, and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results. 4 Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy. The calculation of return on average tangible common equity represents full year or annualized net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average tangible common equity.

Dated: October 30, 2019 /s/ Larry D. Hall - 3 - -;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: MEDALLION FINANCIAL CORP. REPORTS 2019 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS NEW YORK, NY  October 30, 2019  Medallion Financial Corp. (Nasdaq: MFIN, Medallion or the Company), is a finance company that originates and services loans in various consumer and commercial niche industries, announced today its 2019 third quarter results. 2019 Third Quarter Highlights Net income was $5.0 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to a net loss of $4.7 million, or $0.19 per share, in the prior year period Cash flow from operations increased to $21.8 million in the 2019 third quarter from $19.3 million in the second quarter and $16.1 million in the first quarter of this year Net interest income was $25.4 million, primarily reflective of the contributions of the consumer lending segments Net interest margin was 8.71% in the 2019 third quarter, up from 7.94% in the year ago quarter, reflecting the greater contribution of the higher yielding consumer and commercial segments Net interest margin for the recreation segment was 13.25% and 7.07% for the home improvement segment, continuing their strong performance Net income from Medallions consumer and commercial segments totaled $10.0 million in the quarter, compared to $7.7 million in the second quarter and $7.0 million in the first quarter of this year, and $13.1 million in the 2018 third quarter which included a one-time gain of sale of $5.2 million Net consumer loans grew 21% year-to-date The total interest yield on the Companys portfolio was 11.87% in the 2019 third quarter Medallion loan exposure continued to be reduced, with the net portfolio now at $112.0 million at quarter end, down 28% year-to-date Provision for medallion loan losses was $1.9 million in the 2019 third quarter, compared to $13.3 million in the prior year period Andrew Murstein, President of Medallion, stated, This was clearly one of the best quarters we have had in quite some time. Our consumer segments had a record third quarter as Medallion Bank continued to deliver for the Company, while our commercial segment is showing steady growth while also contributing to the Companys earnings. Performance at Medallion Bank through the 2019 third quarter showed continued strength, recording the most profitable quarter since the inception of the Bank, excluding one quarter which included a loan sale, resulting in the Bank recording net income this quarter of $9.3 million. As our primary businesses advance forward, and our medallion exposure declines, we continue to build and increase shareholder value. Our strategy on growing these divisions while decreasing our medallion exposure is still our main focus. Loan origination from the consumer segments has been robust as seen through the portfolio growth in the first nine months of the year. We recorded a strong net interest margin of 8.71% in the third quarter, an improvement from 8.46% last quarter, and the Banks Tier 1 leverage ratio was 15.91% at the end of the third quarter. Medallion Capital, the lead driver in our commercial lending segment, had $41.8 million in capital, while Medallion Bank had $180.3 million in capital. Larry Hall, Chief Financial Officer, stated, The medallion portfolio remains at the lowest level since we went public in 1996, and we are hopeful that any future medallion losses we incur will be less severe than what we have recorded in past. Though we saw a shift in medallion delinquencies over 30 days from the second quarter to the third, it is important to note that subsequent to quarter end, one large relationship totaling $17 million became current and is no longer delinquent. We also saw 90 day delinquencies and losses drop significantly. The net portfolio stood at just 7% of total assets at the end of the third quarter. As of September 30, 2019, the Company and its subsidiaries had an estimated $87.4 million of net operating loss carryforwards. This is primarily a result of all of the medallion write offs we have had the past few years. Additionally, the Company extended the terms of its stock repurchase program previously authorized by its Board of Directors, of which up to $22,874,509 of shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program. While we do not currently anticipate repurchasing shares under the program, we feel that it is prudent to have the program available to us. Consumer Lending Segments Medallions net consumer lending portfolio as of September 30, 2019 was $919.0 million, compared to $741.8 million at the end of the prior year period. Net interest income for the third quarter was $26.4 million, compared to $25.0 million in the prior year period. The average interest rate on the portfolio was 14.67%, compared to 15.18% in the prior year period. Consumer loan delinquencies over 90 days past due as of September 30, 2019 were 0.51%, compared to 0.46% in the prior year period. Commercial Lending Segment The Companys net commercial lending portfolio as of September 30, 2019 was $64.6 million, compared to $60.4 million at the end of the second quarter and $51.2 million at the end of the first quarter of this year. The yield on the portfolio was 11.09%, compared to 12.33% in the prior year period. Net income for the third quarter was $0.986 million. Net commercial loans grew 8% year-to-date. Medallion Lending Segment The Companys net medallion lending portfolio as of September 30, 2019 was $112.0 million, compared to $155.9 million at year end, a 28% decrease. The average interest rate on the medallion portfolio was 4.25% compared to 4.35% a year ago.

Dated: August 5, 2019 /s/ Larry D. Hall - 3 - -;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: MEDALLION FINANCIAL CORP. REPORTS 2019 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS NEW YORK, NY  August 5, 2019  Medallion Financial Corp. (Nasdaq: MFIN, Medallion or the Company), a finance company that originates and services loans in various consumer and commercial niche industries, announced today its 2019 second quarter results. Effective April 2, 2018, Medallion Financial Corp. withdrew its BDC election, and now operates as a finance company following the reporting conventions of bank holding companies, which began with the 2018 second quarter. A major component of this change is that we now consolidate wholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries, particularly Medallion Bank, which were previously treated as unconsolidated portfolio investment companies. All comparisons are now on a consolidated basis unless stated otherwise. 2019 Second Quarter Highlights Net loss was $7.5 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to a net loss of $14.6 million, or $0.60 per share, in the prior year period Cash flow from operations increased to $19.3 million in the 2019 second quarter from $16.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of 20% Medallion loan exposure continues to be reduced, with the portfolio now at $121 million, down 53% from $258 million in the prior year period, and now at its lowest level since our IPO in 1996 Net interest income was $23.2 million, reflecting primarily the contributions of the consumer lending segments Net income from Medallions consumer and commercial segments totaled $7.7 million in the quarter, up from $7.0 million, or 10% from the first quarter Consumer loan originations were $136.2 million in the 2019 second quarter compared to $90.3 million in the first quarter of this year and $129.4 million in the prior year period The total interest yield on the Companys portfolio was 11.67%, the highest since the Company began reporting as a bank holding company The provision for medallion loan losses was $8.2 million in the 2019 second quarter, compared to $24.8 million in the prior year period Medallion delinquencies over 30 days dropped from $55 million in the 2019 first quarter to $25 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 55%, and over 90 days dropped from $4.0 million to $3.7 million in the same period Medallion net loans comprised 8% of the Companys assets at the end of the second quarter Medallion Banks Tier 1 leverage ratio at quarter-end was 15.96% Total assets were $1.48 billion as of June 30, 2019 Andrew Murstein, President of Medallion, stated, We showed continued progress in the second quarter in regards to reducing our total net medallion portfolio as it now stands at the lowest level since we went public in 1996, representing just 8% of assets. As we have been saying, the medallion portfolio losses will be volatile as we reduce our exposure. Even though we continue to have losses, they are less than in prior periods, and we are extremely pleased with the continued reduction in our overall exposure. In addition, the majority of our medallion losses have been non cash as we book reserves, and the consumer and commercial segments continue to produce significant cash earnings. Thus, our focus, and our future, has been our consumer and commercial divisions, and we were very pleased with the continued strong performance of these segments. Our consumer loans grew 9% since the 2019 first quarter. Our commercial loans grew 18% during the same period. These are our fastest growing and most profitable divisions and they continue to perform well. Larry Hall, CFO of Medallion stated, The Company recorded $23.2 million of net interest income for the second quarter and $45.5 million for the first six months of the year. We recorded a strong net interest margin of 8.46% in the second quarter, and the Banks Tier 1 leverage ratio was 15.96%. Loan origination continues to be strong from the consumer segments, showing that the demand for Medallion Banks products is stable and the portfolio is growing. As we previously stated, we continue to explore ways to diversify and grow Medallion Bank. One step towards that was the recent hire of a Director of Strategic Partnerships announced on July 15. This position will oversee a new division focused on exploring opportunities between Medallion Bank and financial technology companies. Even though this new hire was just announced, we are already in discussions with several strong and well known potential partners. Consumer Lending Segments Medallions net consumer lending portfolio was $862.5 million as of June 30, 2019, compared to $790.7 million at the end of the prior year period. In the 2018 third quarter, we completed a consumer loan sale of $100.9 million. Net interest income for the second quarter was $24.8 million. The average interest rate on the portfolio was 14.82%, compared to 14.76% in the prior year period. Consumer loan delinquencies over 90 days past due as of June 30, 2019 were 0.44%, compared to 0.33% in the prior year period. Commercial Lending Segment The Companys net commercial lending portfolio as of June 30, 2019 was $60.4 million compared to $51.2 million in the first quarter of this year. The yield on the portfolio was 11.71%, compared to 14.06% in the prior year period. Net income for the second quarter was $0.15 million. Medallion Capital remains well capitalized, and expects continued growth in its loan portfolio for the 2019 second half. Medallion Lending Segment The Companys net medallion lending portfolio as of June 30, 2019 was $121.3 million, compared to $258.0 million at June 30, 2018, a 53% decrease. The average interest rate on the medallion portfolio was 4.37% compared to 4.35% a year ago. Total medallion delinquencies over 90 days were $3.7 million as of June 30, 2019, compared to $12.4 million in the prior year period. Medallion provision for loan losses was $8.2 million in the quarter, compared to $24.8 million in the 2018 second quarter. Medallion loans comprised 12% of the Companys loans receivable as of June 30, 2019, compared to 23% in the prior year period. Mr. Murstein concluded, We continue to execute on our plan to reduce medallion exposure, and grow the Companys most profitable and fastest growing divisions. The total yield on our portfolio increased to 11.67%. Our net interest margin was 8.19% for the 2018 final nine months, and for the 2019 first six months it was 8.49%. That is among the highest of all banks in the US. We also have the potential to increase our yields and net interest margins as the 4% yielding medallion loans are run off, and the 15% yielding recreation loans are added. Medallion Capital, the driver in our commercial lending segment, has $40.6 million in capital, and our Bank has $171.5 million in capital. They both are well capitalized, and project continued growth for the balance of this year and into the foreseeable future. 2 Conference Call Information The Company will be hosting a conference call to discuss the second quarter financial results on Tuesday, August 6, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.
