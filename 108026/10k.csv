BUSINESS Our Company NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications. The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely difficult with traditional coding. Some of the most recent applications of GPU-powered deep learning include recommendation systems, which are AI algorithms trained to understand the preferences, previous decisions, and characteristics of people and products using data gathered about their interactions, large language models, which can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets, and generative AI, which uses algorithms that create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos, based on the data they have been trained on. NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers. Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $37 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU for general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs and networking accelerate many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the pace described by Moore’s Law, NVIDIA accelerated computing delivers performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward. Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the world’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality live video gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding because of the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators. Researchers and developers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to climate forecasting. With support for more than 2,800 applications - including 23 of the top 25 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from climate prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers over 70% of the supercomputers on the global TOP500 list, including 23 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list. 4 Table of Contents The world’s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our GPUs and broader data center-scale accelerated computing platforms to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end-users, including search, recommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, translation, AI assistants, navigation, and cloud computing. A rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our GPUs and software to bring automation to the products and services they build. The transportation industry is turning to our platforms for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry is leveraging them for enhanced medical imaging and acceleration of drug discovery; and the financial services industry is using them for fraud detection. Professional designers use our GPUs and software to create visual effects in movies and to design buildings and products ranging from cell phones to commercial aircraft. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp., or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited, or Arm, from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Our Businesses We report our business results in two segments. The Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and cryptocurrency mining processors, or CMP. The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU, or vGPU, software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating metaverse and 3D internet applications. Our Markets We specialize in markets in which our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. Data Center The NVIDIA computing platform is focused on accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads, such as AI, data analytics, graphics and scientific computing, across hyperscale, cloud, enterprise, public sector, and edge data centers. The platform consists of our energy efficient GPUs, data processing units, or DPUs, interconnects and systems, our CUDA programming model, and a growing body of software libraries, software development kits, or SDKs, application frameworks and services, which are either available as part of the platform or packaged and sold separately. For both AI and HPC applications, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform greatly increases computer and data center performance and power efficiency relative to conventional CPU-only approaches. In the field of AI, NVIDIA’s platform accelerates both deep learning and machine learning workloads. Deep learning is a computer science approach where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data in the form of images, sounds and text - in some instances better than humans - and in turn provide predictions in production use cases. Machine learning is a related approach that leverages algorithms as well 5 Table of Contents as data to learn how to make determinations or predictions. HPC, which includes scientific computing, uses numerical computational approaches to solve large and complex problems. We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such as consumer product and service recommendations, to chatbots for the automation of or assistance with live customer interactions, to enabling fraud detection in financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling. These organizations include the world’s leading consumer internet and cloud services companies, enterprises and startups seeking to implement AI in transformative ways across multiple industries. We partner with industry leaders to help transform their applications or their computing platforms. We also have partnerships in transportation, retail, healthcare, and manufacturing, among others, to accelerate the adoption of AI.

In fiscal year 2023, our supply exceeded our demand in several areas, and our revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. Historical seasonality trends may not repeat. Manufacturing We do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ key suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as memory, substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the 9 Table of Contents production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future. We have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations. We utilize suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers, such as Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., or BYD Auto, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., or Hon Hai, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our networking cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often consign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract manufacturers. We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc. and Chroma ATE Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto and Hon Hai, distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions. Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future. Our current competitors include: • suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; • large cloud services companies with internal teams designing chips and software that incorporate accelerated or AI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc., and Baidu, Inc.; • suppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms; 10 Table of Contents • suppliers of SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla, Inc.; and • suppliers of interconnect, switch cable solutions, and DPUs such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies. Patents and Proprietary Rights We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2023 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as: • the location in which our products are manufactured; • our strategic technology or product directions in different countries; • the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and • the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions. We have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements. Government Regulations Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government announced new license requirements that impact certain exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of some of our data center products. The impact of the new license requirements is difficult to quantify, and it may be challenging for us to manage our operations and forecast our operating results due to these requirements. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors- Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact. Additionally, our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material impact on our business. In February 2022, we announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, 11 Table of Contents climate change, cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts. Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices related to ESG. We assess our programs annually in consideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders. The following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and practices. More information can be found on the Corporate Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, or CR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG. Climate Change In the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts. In our CR Report published in July 2022, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2022. Fiscal year 2023 metrics are expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2024. There has been no material impact to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers. Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs are inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the November 2022 Green500 list. We plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies. Human Capital Management We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders.

Recruitment As the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted strong talent globally with our differentiated hiring strategies for university, professional, executive and diverse recruits. The COVID-19 pandemic created expanded hiring opportunities in new geographies and provided increased 12 Table of Contents flexibility for employees to work from locations of their choice. Our workforce is about 80% technical and about 50% hold advanced degrees. Earlier in fiscal year 2023, we slowed our hiring to focus on our current employees and manage costs. We maintain a connection for global talent from universities through on-campus collaborations with professors and student organizations, as well as engagement with technical organizations and participation at industry conferences. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 37% of our new hires in fiscal year 2023 coming from employee referrals. Development and Retention To support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate learning paths focused on our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current programs and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on developmental activities and internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement. To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses. We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In fiscal year 2023, our overall turnover rate was 5.3%. Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and financial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents. Diversity and Inclusion We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees. When recruiting for new talent or managing current talent, we focus on recruiting, developing, and retaining a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates. To this end, we have been: • Partnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities; • Assigning dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process; 13 Table of Contents • Embedding inclusion recruiting partners throughout the business to help align candidates with internal opportunities; • Supporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders; • Providing peer support and executive sponsors for nine internal community resource groups; • Providing training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for diversity; • Ensuring we have and review a diverse pool of candidates for requisitions; and • Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees. Health and COVID-19 We supported our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority during fiscal year 2023 and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to keep our workforce safe. Hybrid Working Environment We support a hybrid work environment, understanding that many employees want the flexibility to work in the office or from home, and make that decision based on the conditions around them at any point in time. Steps we took to support employees working from home include: • Home-focused health and well-being programs; • Learning and development resources on how to work, lead and manage remotely; and • Opportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually. During fiscal year 2024, we will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days” for employees to recharge.

RISK FACTORS In evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Risk Factors Summary Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets • Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results. 15 Table of Contents • Competition in our current and target markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue. Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing • Failure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. • Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business. • Defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate and can damage our business. Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business • Adverse economic conditions may harm our business. • International operations are a significant part of our business, and economic, political, business, and other changes in the regions in which we operate may expose us to risks that could harm our business. • Product, system security, and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, stock price and reputation. • Business disruptions could harm our operations and financial results. • Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. • We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, nor successfully integrate acquisition targets. • A significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of customers and could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. • We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. • Modification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. • The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. • Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters • We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations, and political and other actions, which may adversely impact our business. • Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities could result in financial, reputational and operational harm. • Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational and financial harm and liability. • Adequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. • We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations. Privacy or security concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter customers, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability. 16 Table of Contents • Our operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors. • Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. • Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. • Delaware law, provisions in our governing documents, and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results. Our accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to: • timely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance existing products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies; • develop new products and technologies through investments in research and development; • launch new offerings with new business models including standalone software, cloud solutions, and software-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions; • expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies; • meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety and compliance standards; • manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction; • develop, acquire, and maintain the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including our acquisitions integrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and • complete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities. We invest in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed. We will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services include NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI models, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has partnered with leading cloud service providers to host these services in their data centers, and we entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of fiscal year 2023 to support these offerings and our research and development activities. NVIDIA AI cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and several other software solutions. These new 17 Table of Contents business models or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or as-a-service solutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings. Competition in our current and target markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue. Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline. Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing Failure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have had and may in the future have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Demand for our products is based on many factors in addition to the lead times described above that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including: • competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements; • changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand; • sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local health issues; • rapidly changing technology or customer requirements; • time to market; 18 Table of Contents • new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products; • new or unexpected end use cases; • increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions; • business decisions made by third parties; • the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and AI cloud service offerings; • the demand for cryptocurrency mining; or • government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage. Our supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand. At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with demand for our products. Our demand predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently negatively impact our revenue as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult and prior trends may not continue. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. We sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties. If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. If we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and become a greater portion of our total supply while our 19 Table of Contents revenue has sequentially declined. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us. The use of our GPUs for other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, a number of years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the recently implemented Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In addition, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. Additionally, we depend on developers and other third parties to build accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers to build applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand. Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedules and could harm our business. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. We face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including: • lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner; 20 Table of Contents • failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products; • failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products; • limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers; • loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier; • lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules; • suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification; • delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours; • requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance; • low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology; and • disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts. Defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage our reputation and cause us to lose market share. Our hardware and software product offerings are complex and they have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases, or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies. 21 Table of Contents For example, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business Adverse economic conditions may harm our business. Economic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, higher interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: • increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively impacted our gross margin and may continue to do so; • increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margins; • decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or licensees; • the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users; • limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions; • the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensing parties; reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations; lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and • increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. International operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to us to risks that could harm our business. We conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 69% of our revenue during fiscal year 2023 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of COVID-19 or other global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations, and natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events. 22 Table of Contents Product, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation. Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible. Threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business. To defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to detect all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm. We hold confidential and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For example, we hold propriety game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. 23 Table of Contents Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs . Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results. Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our business and those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, 24 Table of Contents unexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business. We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, in February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded in operating expenses a $1.35 billion charge in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. Additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to: • difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business; • diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; • assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets; • integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles; • coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate; • difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; • difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; • stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition; • legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; • potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions; • the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities; • the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration; 25 Table of Contents • negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate; • exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; • potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring; and • impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers. For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. In fiscal year 2023, we continued the implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. 26 Table of Contents Identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. COVID-19-related disruptions have created and may continue to create supply chain and logistics constraints, and COVID-19 containment around the world has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations. Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment efforts in China. End customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may continue if lockdowns return. COVID-19 has also resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption of and volatility in global financial markets, which could impact overall technology spending or negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. All of these factors have had or could in the future have a material negative impact on our business. We modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, including with respect to flexible work and social distancing measures, and we may take further actions as required by government regulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. These and other measures have caused and may in the future cause us to incur incremental expenses and costs. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. The impact of COVID-19 can also exacerbate other risks discussed in these risk factors. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to: • our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services; • our ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations; • our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for these customers and their extended payment terms, and customer bad debt write-offs; • our vendors' payment requirements; • unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and • changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards. Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated future financial results. For example, we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for general business operations. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or experience substantial price volatility. 27 Table of Contents Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business. We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future. The increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies has already resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls may be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which are increasingly likely, would restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and 28 Table of Contents negatively impacting our business and financial results. Increasing use of economic sanctions may also impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. The new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. We are required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), which could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new A800 offering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner. The new requirements may have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products. Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. Additionally, if we are unable to sell our alternative product offerings in China, we may have excess inventory, harming our results. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel. Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us. Shareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have placed increased importance on the implications of the social and environmental cost of their investments and these parties, as well as government regulators, have focused increasingly on corporate ESG and sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. Additionally, our ESG practices, oversight of ESG practices, or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator, or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet sustainability disclosure or ESG reporting standards. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, choose not to conduct business with potential 29 Table of Contents customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to liability. Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational and financial harm and liability. Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational and financial harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and services. AI poses emerging ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the cost of related research and development, and changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational harm. Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. We may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results. We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable. We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations. Privacy or security concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability. We may process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use 30 Table of Contents of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims. In the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, became operative in 2023, and restricts the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restricts the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restricts the retention of personal information; expands the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency which can impose administrative fines for noncompliance. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have each passed their own privacy legislation which differ from the CPRA and each become effective in 2023. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase. Worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices. In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. While the European Union and United States governments have recently announced an agreement in principle on a new bilateral cross-border transfer mechanism, it is uncertain whether this agreement will be overturned in court like the previous two European Union-United States bilateral cross-border transfer agreements. These mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China, or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China, and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business. We may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, 31 Table of Contents certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We may publish privacy policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences. Data protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition. We have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors. We are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and undergoing tax audits in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows. Further, changes in tax laws may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. These include changes to U.S. tax laws and regulations, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which implements a 15% minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and parts of which became effective for us in fiscal year 2023. It is possible that these changes, or other tax law changes, could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse impacts. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD. The OECD recommended changes to long-standing tax principles and continues to develop new proposals, including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and financial condition. Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of tax audits, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our financial results. Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to 32 Table of Contents our business. For example, we are defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. As of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may receive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program. Maintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our business. Our ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing. Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 17, 2023, we had approximately 344 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On May 23, 2022, our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.10 billion shares for a total cost of $17.12 billion through January 29, 2023. During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 63 million shares for $10.04 billion. As of January 29, 2023, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.23 billion through December 2023. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. In fiscal year 2023, we paid $398 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications. Our two operating segments are ""Compute & Networking"" and ""Graphics."" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Supply, Products Transitions, and New Products and Business Models Our supply, which includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current supply chain conditions, complexity of our products, and recent reductions in demand. At the end of fiscal year 2023, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented more than half of our total supply. Inventory provisions for excess inventory and purchase obligations totaled $2.17 billion in fiscal year 2023. We may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with demand for our products. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and legacy architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are currently transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of legacy architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult and prior trends may not continue. We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist. Examples include our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models and generative models. Our demand estimates for these use cases and applications can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use cases and applications. NVIDIA AI Cloud Service Offerings We will offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI cloud services directly and through our network of partners. Examples of these services include NVIDIA DGX Cloud, which is cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI models, and customizable pretrained AI models. NVIDIA has partnered with leading cloud service providers to host these services in their data centers. We entered into multi-year cloud service agreements in the second half of fiscal year 2023 to these offerings and our research and development activities. NVIDIA AI cloud services may not be successful and will take time, resources and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software solutions for AI including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE for automotive, and several other software solutions. These new business models or strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or as-a-service solutions. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings. 36 Table of Contents Global Trade During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced new license requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. We are required to transition certain operations out of China (including Hong Kong), including research and development and supply and distribution operations. We have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new A800 offering. Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our results and competitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, or if customers develop their own internal solution, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. COVID-19 During fiscal year 2023, we reopened our offices worldwide. We incurred incremental expenses and related in-office costs as we ramped onsite services. Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment efforts in China. During fiscal year 2023, end customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted by lockdowns and this impact may continue if lockdowns return. COVID-19-related disruptions have created and may continue to create supply chain and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Russia In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and later in the year, we closed business operations in Russia. Direct sales to Russia in fiscal year 2022 were immaterial. Our revenue to partners that sell into Russia may have been negatively impacted due to the war in Ukraine. Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Fiscal Year 2023 Summary Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Change ($ in millions, except per share data) Revenue $ 26,974 $ 26,914 — % Gross margin 56.9 % 64.9 % Down 8.0 pts Operating expenses $ 11,132 $ 7,434 Up 50% Income from operations $ 4,224 $ 10,041 Down 58% Net income $ 4,368 $ 9,752 Down 55% Net income per diluted share $ 1.74 $ 3.85 Down 55% We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. Revenue for fiscal year 2023 revenue was $26.97 billion, flat compared with a year ago. 37 Table of Contents Data Center revenue was up 41% from a year ago led by strong growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects purchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud service offerings and our research and development activities. Gaming revenue was down 27% from a year ago reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand. Professional Visualization revenue was down 27% from a year ago reflecting a lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels. Automotive revenue was up 60% from a year ago reflecting growth in sales of self-driving solutions, computing solutions for electric vehicle makers and strength in sales of AI cockpit solutions. The increase also included growth in automotive development arrangements. OEM and Other revenue was down 61% from a year ago driven by notebook OEM and CMP. CMP revenue was nominal in fiscal year 2023 and $550 million in fiscal year 2022. Gross margin for fiscal year 2023 declined from a year ago, driven by $2.17 billion of inventory charges largely relating to excess supply of NVIDIA Ampere architecture Gaming and Data Center products as compared to the demand expectations for these products, particularly for the expected demand in China. The inventory charges were comprised of $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our demand expectations. Operating expenses, which included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction, were up 50% from a year ago. The increase also reflected compensation, data center infrastructure, and engineering development costs. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.30 billion. During fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.44 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $7.23 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Market Platform Highlights Data Center revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $15.01 billion, up 41% from fiscal year 2022. The strong growth in Data Center revenue was influenced by hyperscaler and cloud usage of our accelerated computing platforms and networking portfolio. In Data Center, we announced the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture and began ramping the first products based on the architecture, including the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. The NVIDIA OVX server reference design launched for digital twins and other Omniverse applications. We completed two new large language models for cloud AI services — NVIDIA NeMo LLM and NVIDIA BioNeMo LLM. Additionally, we announced the NVIDIA Spectrum-4 end-to-end 400Gbps networking platform and began shipping Quantum-2 in December 2022. Gaming revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $9.07 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022. Gaming results were influenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess inventory with our channel partners. We introduced pricing programs for our channel partners and started undershipping GPU supply to the partners so that we could lower inventory in the channel. As we exited fiscal year 2023, we have made meaningful progress in establishing lower inventory levels with our channel partners. In Gaming, we announced the new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture, and introduced the first products based on Ada, including the GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX 4070 Ti desktop GPUs and laptop GPUs featured in over 170 laptop designs. We introduced NVIDIA DLSS 3 for over 50 games and applications. We brought GeForce RTX 4080-class performance to the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier. Professional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $1.54 billion, down 27% from fiscal year 2022. Professional Visualization results were influenced by the rapid change in economic conditions causing excess inventory with our OEM partners. In Professional Visualization, we added new NVIDIA Ampere architecture RTX GPUs for workstations. We also announced Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and Omniverse Cloud and released a major update to NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise. 38 Table of Contents Automotive revenue for fiscal year 2023 grew 60% compared to fiscal year 2022 to $903 million. In Automotive, we started production of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin autonomous vehicle SOC and introduced next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Thor. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% in fiscal year 2023 and 0.9% in fiscal year 2022. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. In the past, our manufacturing lead times have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products. Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling 39 Table of Contents price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion and $907 million, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. 40 Table of Contents We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 43.1 35.1 Gross profit 56.9 64.9 Operating expenses Research and development 27.2 19.6 Sales, general and administrative 9.1 8.0 Acquisition termination cost 5.0 — Total operating expenses 41.3 27.6 Income from operations 15.6 37.3 Interest income 1.0 0.1 Interest expense (1.0) (0.9) Other, net (0.1) 0.4 Other income (expense), net (0.1) (0.4) Income before income tax 15.5 36.9 Income tax expense (benefit) (0.7) 0.7 Net income 16.2 % 36.2 % 41 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Compute & Networking $ 15,068 $ 11,046 $ 4,022 36 % Graphics 11,906 15,868 (3,962) (25) % Total $ 26,974 $ 26,914 $ 60 — % Compute & Networking - The year-on-year increase was led by growth from hyperscale customers and also reflects purchases made by several CSP partners to support multi-year cloud service agreements for our new NVIDIA AI cloud service offerings and our research and development activities. The increase was also related to the growth in Automotive. CMP contributed an insignificant amount in fiscal year 2023 compared to $550 million in fiscal year 2022. Graphics - The year-on-year decrease primarily reflects lower sell-in to partners to help reduce channel inventory levels as global macro-economic conditions and COVID-19 related disruptions in China weighed on gaming demand. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 69% and 84% of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in revenue outside the U.S. was primarily driven by China and Taiwan related to Data Center and Gaming. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers in a different location. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations. Gross margin was 56.9% and 64.9% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $2.17 billion of inventory provisions in fiscal year 2023, which consists of approximately $1.04 billion for inventory on hand and approximately $1.13 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our current demand projections. Inventory provisions totaled $2.17 billion and $354 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off totaled $137 million and $111 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% and 0.9% in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory provisions. Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment decreased during fiscal year 2023 when compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory and related provisions and lower margins of GeForce GPUs. 42 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 7,339 $ 5,268 $ 2,071 39 % % of revenue 27.2 % 19.6 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 2,440 2,166 274 13 % % of revenue 9.1 % 8.0 % Acquisition termination cost 1,353 — 1,353 100 % % of revenue 5.0 % — % Total operating expenses $ 11,132 $ 7,434 $ 3,698 50 % % of revenue 41.3 % 27.6 % The increase in research and development expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased compensation, employee growth, engineering development costs, and data center infrastructure. The increase in sales, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2023 was primarily driven by increased compensation and employee growth. We recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Interest income $ 267 $ 29 $ 238 821 % Interest expense (262) (236) (26) 11 % Other, net (48) 107 (155) (145) % Other income (expense), net $ (43) $ (100) $ 57 (57) % Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher yields earned on our investments. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. The increase in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion debt offering issued in June 2021. Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Change in other, net, compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by mark-to-market losses from publicly traded equity investments and changes in value from our non-affiliated private investments.

Income Taxes We recognized income tax benefit of $187 million for fiscal year 2023 and income tax expense of $189 million for fiscal year 2022. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was a benefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023 and an expense of 1.9% for fiscal year 2022. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. 43 Table of Contents The fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate includes the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses beginning in fiscal year 2023, which resulted in a greater FDII deduction and significantly increased current taxes, with a corresponding deferred tax benefit at the relevant statutory tax rate. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to increased tax benefits of the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to lower profitability. This is partially offset by the impact of an increase in the proportion of earnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time benefits of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary in fiscal year 2022, or the Domestication. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.

Liquidity and Capital Resources January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,389 $ 1,990 Marketable securities 9,907 19,218 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 13,296 $ 21,208 Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,641 $ 9,108 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 7,375 $ (9,830) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (11,617) $ 1,865 As of January 29, 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $7.91 billion from the end of fiscal year 2022. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to a decrease in net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the Arm acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion, and higher tax payments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by lower accounts receivable due to strong collections partially offset by timing of supplier payments and inventory deliveries. Cash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by lower purchases and higher sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by higher capital expenditures. 44 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, due to share repurchases and the absence of debt issuance proceeds in fiscal year 2023, offset by absence of debt repayment. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and cash generated by our operations. At the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $13.30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.25 billion of debt repayment due in fiscal year 2024. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. During fiscal year 2024, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.10 billion to $1.30 billion related to property and equipment. Except for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. at the end of fiscal year 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. The adverse cash flow impact of mandatory capitalization will be reduced in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Capital Return to Shareholders During fiscal year 2023, we returned $10.04 billion in share repurchases and $398 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. As of January 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.23 billion through December 2023. 45 Table of Contents Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program Our aggregate debt maturities as of January 29, 2023, by year payable, are as follows: January 29, 2023 (In millions) Due in one year $ 1,250 Due in one to five years 2,250 Due in five to ten years 4,000 Due in greater than ten years 3,500 Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs (47) Net carrying amount 10,953 Less short-term portion (1,250) Total long-term portion $ 9,703 We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had not issued any commercial paper. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively. We have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.02 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $95 million, recorded in non-current income tax payable at the end of fiscal year 2023. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Climate Change To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $17 million. As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of 46 Table of Contents the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United States dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. The primary currency we hedge is Israeli Shekel. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $112 million and $103 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized. If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $36 million and $41 million as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The information required by this Item is set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of January 29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 29, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we completed the consolidated financial reporting phase of the implementation, which included updating our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framewor k (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 52 Table of Contents directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments As described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 29, 2023, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159 million and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were both 52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year. Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. Prior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 7 have been adjusted to write off immaterial fully amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. In February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to five years , and assembly and test equipment from five to seven years . This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $ 133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are 59 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Cloud Services Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Product Warranties We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Stock-based Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line 60 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.48 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period. 61 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount 62 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years . Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years . Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Leases We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. The quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. 63 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. Business Combination We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee. Marketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net. Note 2 - Business Combination Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate due to significant 64 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $ 1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing. Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $ 7.13 billion. Purchase Price Allocation The aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions): Purchase Price Cash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares (1) $ 7,033 Cash for Mellanox equity awards (2) 16 Total cash consideration 7,049 Fair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by NVIDIA (3) 85 Total purchase consideration $ 7,134 Allocation Cash and cash equivalents $ 115 Marketable securities 699 Accounts receivable, net 216 Inventories 320 Prepaid expenses and other assets 179 Property and equipment, net 144 Goodwill 3,431 Intangible assets 2,970 Accounts payable ( 136 ) Accrued and other current liabilities ( 236 ) Income tax liability ( 191 ) Deferred income tax liability ( 258 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 119 ) $ 7,134 (1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00 per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately 56 million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares. (2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox. (3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services. We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments. The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10 % for fiscal year 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to 65 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2021. Intangible Assets The estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets at the time of the acquisition are as follows: Fair Value Useful Lives (In millions) Developed technology (1) $ 1,640 5 years Customer relationships (2) 440 3 years Order backlog (3) 190 Based on actual shipments Trade names (4) 70 5 years Total identified finite-lived intangible assets 2,340 IPR&D (5) 630 N/A Total identified intangible assets $ 2,970 (1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. (2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method. (3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021. (4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach. (5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses. Mellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 630 million for the fair value of this project, which was initially not amortized.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. Equity Incentive Program We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 29, 2023, up to 47 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 2 million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 29, 2023, there were 160 million shares available for future grants. Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25 % vesting quarterly thereafter, (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5 % vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 6.25 % vesting quarterly. PSUs vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25 % vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100 % on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria. 69 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the 2012 Plan. Employees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15 % of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months . The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85 % of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 29, 2023, we had 230 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022.

In fiscal year 2022, we repaid the $ 1.00 billion of 2.20 % Notes Due 2021. 77 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The carrying value of the Notes, the calendar year of maturity, and the associated interest rates were as follows: Expected Remaining Term (years) Effective Interest Rate January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 (In millions) 0.309 % Notes Due 2023 0.4 0.41 % $ 1,250 $ 1,250 0.584 % Notes Due 2024 1.4 0.66 % 1,250 1,250 3.20 % Notes Due 2026 3.6 3.31 % 1,000 1,000 1.55 % Notes Due 2028 5.4 1.64 % 1,250 1,250 2.85 % Notes Due 2030 7.2 2.93 % 1,500 1,500 2.00 % Notes Due 2031 8.4 2.09 % 1,250 1,250 3.50 % Notes Due 2040 17.2 3.54 % 1,000 1,000 3.50 % Notes Due 2050 27.2 3.54 % 2,000 2,000 3.70 % Notes Due 2060 37.2 3.73 % 500 500 Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs ( 47 ) ( 54 ) Net carrying amount 10,953 10,946 Less short-term portion ( 1,250 ) — Total long-term portion $ 9,703 $ 10,946 All our notes are unsecured senior obligations. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the notes. Our notes pay interest semi-annually. We may redeem each of our notes prior to maturity, subject to a make-whole premium as defined in the applicable form of note. As of January 29, 2023, we were in compliance with the required covenants, which are non-financial in nature, under the Notes. Commercial Paper We have a $ 575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 29, 2023, we had no t issued any commercial paper. Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations reflect our commitments to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including long-term supply agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets. We have entered into several long-term supply agreements, under which we have made advance payments and have $ 810 million remaining unpaid. As of January 29, 2023, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations totaling $ 4.92 billion, inclusive of the $ 810 million. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers, subcontractors and contract manufacturers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but may result in the payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Other non-inventory purchase obligations of $ 3.14 billion include $ 2.23 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. 78 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Total future purchase commitments as of January 29, 2023, are as follows: Commitments (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2024 $ 5,230 2025 983 2026 679 2027 622 2028 296 2029 and thereafter 253 Total $ 8,063 Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities The estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $ 82 million and $ 46 million as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, respectively. The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty activity consisted of the following: Year Ended January 29, January 30, January 31, 2023 2022 2021 (In millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 46 $ 22 $ 15 Additions 145 40 28 Utilization ( 109 ) ( 16 ) ( 21 ) Balance at end of period $ 82 $ 46 $ 22 In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we recorded $ 122 million in product warranty liabilities primarily related to a defect identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we recognized a warranty-related benefit of approximately $ 70 million in cost of revenue due to favorable product recovery. In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. Litigation Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, 79 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 10, 2022. The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures. Accounting for Loss Contingencies As of January 29, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. 80 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 14 - Income Taxes The income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) Current income taxes: Federal $ 1,703 $ 482 $ 197 State 46 42 1 Foreign 228 71 161 Total current 1,977 595 359 Deferred taxes: Federal ( 2,165 ) ( 420 ) ( 246 ) Foreign 1 14 ( 36 ) Total deferred ( 2,164 ) ( 406 ) ( 282 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ ( 187 ) $ 189 $ 77 Income before income tax consists of the following: Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) U.S. $ 3,477 $ 8,446 $ 1,437 Foreign 704 1,495 2,972 Income before income tax $ 4,181 $ 9,941 $ 4,409 The income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes as follows: Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions, except percentages) Tax expense computed at federal statutory rate $ 878 21.0 % $ 2,088 21.0 % $ 926 21.0 % Expense (benefit) resulting from: Acquisition termination cost 261 6.2 % — — % — — % State income taxes, net of federal tax effect 50 1.2 % 42 0.4 % 10 0.2 % Foreign-derived intangible income ( 739 ) ( 17.7 ) % ( 520 ) ( 5.2 ) % — — % Stock-based compensation ( 309 ) ( 7.4 ) % ( 337 ) ( 3.4 ) % ( 136 ) ( 3.1 ) % U.S. federal research and development tax credit ( 278 ) ( 6.6 ) % ( 289 ) ( 2.9 ) % ( 173 ) ( 3.9 ) % Foreign tax rate differential ( 83 ) ( 2.0 ) % ( 497 ) ( 5.0 ) % ( 561 ) ( 12.7 ) % IP domestication — — % ( 244 ) ( 2.5 ) % — — % Other 33 0.8 % ( 54 ) ( 0.5 ) % 11 0.2 % Income tax expense (benefit) $ ( 187 ) ( 4.5 ) % $ 189 1.9 % $ 77 1.7 % 81 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below: January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Capitalized research and development expenditure (1) $ 1,859 $ 508 Research and other tax credit carryforwards 951 798 GILTI deferred tax assets 800 378 Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes 686 258 Net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 409 118 Operating lease liabilities 193 125 Stock-based compensation 99 86 Property, equipment and intangible assets 66 22 Other deferred tax assets 91 22 Gross deferred tax assets 5,154 2,315 Less valuation allowance ( 1,484 ) ( 907 ) Total deferred tax assets 3,670 1,408 Deferred tax liabilities: Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 228 ) ( 150 ) Operating lease assets ( 179 ) ( 113 ) Acquired intangibles ( 115 ) ( 169 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities ( 522 ) ( 432 ) Net deferred tax asset (2) $ 3,148 $ 976 (1) Capitalized research and development deferred tax assets were previously included in Property, equipment and intangible assets. (2) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $ 3.40 billion and $ 1.22 billion and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $ 247 million and $ 245 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 29, 2023, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.05 billion and $ 245 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable. As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $ 1.48 billion and $ 907 million, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. As of January 29, 2023, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 363 million, $ 329 million and $ 329 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years 2026 and 2024, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 329 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 29, 2023, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 26 million, before the impact of uncertain tax positions, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2024. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.49 billion, before the impact of uncertain tax positions. $ 1.41 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely and $ 83 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2024. As of January 29, 2023, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of $ 1.38 billion that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2024. Our tax attributes remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of tax attributes may also 82 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the tax attributes may expire or be denied before utilization. A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,013 $ 776 $ 583 Increases in tax positions for current year 268 246 158 Increases in tax positions for prior years 1 14 60 Decreases in tax positions for prior years ( 15 ) ( 4 ) ( 11 ) Settlements ( 9 ) ( 8 ) ( 5 ) Lapse in statute of limitations ( 20 ) ( 11 ) ( 9 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,238 $ 1,013 $ 776 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 29, 2023 are $ 770 million of tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We recognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense line of our consolidated statements of income of $ 33 million, $ 14 million, and $ 7 million during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, we have accrued $ 95 million and $ 59 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 29, 2023, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 29, 2023, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2022. As of January 29, 2023, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany, India, Israel, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2022. Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity Capital Return Program During fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 63 million shares for $ 10.04 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program through January 29, 2023, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.10 billion shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $ 17.12 billion. As of January 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase an additional $ 7.23 billion of shares through December 2023. 83 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) During fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, we paid $ 398 million, $ 399 million, and $ 395 million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. In fiscal year 2022, we retired our existing 349 million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $ 20 million and retained earnings by $ 12.0 billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares. Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 227 million, $ 168 million, and $ 120 million, respectively. Note 17 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. The Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and CMP. The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating metaverse and 3D internet applications. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, corporate infrastructure and support costs, restructuring costs, acquisition termination cost, IP-related and legal settlement costs, contributions, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category. 84 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Compute & Networking Graphics All Other Consolidated (In millions) Year Ended January 29, 2023: Revenue $ 15,068 $ 11,906 $ — $ 26,974 Operating income (loss) $ 5,083 $ 4,552 $ ( 5,411 ) $ 4,224 Year Ended January 30, 2022: Revenue $ 11,046 $ 15,868 $ — $ 26,914 Operating income (loss) $ 4,598 $ 8,492 $ ( 3,049 ) $ 10,041 Year Ended January 31, 2021: Revenue $ 6,841 $ 9,834 $ — $ 16,675 Operating income (loss) $ 2,548 $ 4,612 $ ( 2,628 ) $ 4,532 Year Ended January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) Reconciling items included in ""All Other"" category: Stock-based compensation expense $ ( 2,710 ) $ ( 2,004 ) $ ( 1,397 ) Acquisition termination cost ( 1,353 ) — — Acquisition-related and other costs ( 674 ) ( 636 ) ( 836 ) Unallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses ( 595 ) ( 399 ) ( 357 ) Restructuring costs and other ( 54 ) — — IP-related and legal settlement costs ( 23 ) ( 10 ) ( 38 ) Contributions ( 2 ) — — Total $ ( 5,411 ) $ ( 3,049 ) $ ( 2,628 ) Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the billing location of the customer.

Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, and software layers. With our acquisition of Mellanox, we strengthened our end-to-end expertise in data center architectures, positioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets, which include Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in R&D: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets. Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and other software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership 7 Table of Contents position. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are almost 3 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and almost 10,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform.

Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers. Seasonality Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers, professional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2022, our demand exceeded our supply in several areas, and our revenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. However, there can be no assurance that these trends will continue. Our fiscal year 2022 supply-constrained environment or historical seasonality trends may not repeat. Manufacturing We do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future. We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often consign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit to the contract manufacturers. We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration using test equipment purchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as BYD Auto Co. Ltd. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouses in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions. Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our 9 Table of Contents competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future. Our current competitors include: • suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel; • large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon; • suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and • suppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon. Patents and Proprietary Rights We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2022 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as: • the location in which our products are manufactured; • our strategic technology or product directions in different countries; • the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and • the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions. We have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements. Government Regulations Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material impact on our business. On February 8, 2022, we announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts. 10 Table of Contents Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. We integrate sound environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices concerning ESG. We undertake an annual analysis to ensure that our ESG priorities remain aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders. The following section provides an overview of some of these principles and practices. More information can be found on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, or CSR Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual CSR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG. Climate Change In the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts. In our CSR Report, we report several metrics related to our environmental impact, our most recent full reporting year being fiscal year 2021, with our fiscal year 2022 metrics expected to be published in May 2022. There has been no material impact to capital expenditures, our results of operations or competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers. Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs are inherently more energy efficient than other forms of computing because they are optimized for throughput and performance per watt rather than absolute performance. GPU servers are approximately 40x more energy efficient than traditional CPU servers for AI workloads. The power efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 25 systems on the November 2021 Green500 list. We plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change. The system will build a digital twin of the Earth on our Omniverse platform, enable scientists to do ultra-high-resolution climate modeling, and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of cities and nations so they can act with more urgency. Human Capital Management We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of January 30, 2022, we had 22,473 employees in 32 countries. 16,242 were engaged in research and development and 6,231 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff. Recruitment The demand for talent in new markets such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. With differentiated hiring strategies for university, professional, executive, and for diversity, we have been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We attract global talent from universities, collaborations with college programs, professional organization affiliations, industry conferences, community resource group participation, direct sourcing and outreach. Our employees play an important part in recruiting, with over 39% of our new hires coming from employee referrals. Development and Retention To support employee advancement, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We curate learning paths focused on our most common 11 Table of Contents development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current programs and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career coaching that advises employees on developmental activities and pursuing internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement. To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses. In fiscal year 2022, our overall turnover rate was 4.9%. Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being and financial health, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents. Diversity and Inclusion We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability. We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates. Other efforts we have been or are undertaking include: • Expanded recruiting teams and deepened our college pipeline to engage more diverse students and partnering with minority-serving institutions and professional organizations; • Supported the development of women employees to build a pipeline of future leaders; • Supported underrepresented employees through our 11 internal community resource groups; • Providing training and education to managers and peers on how to foster a supportive environment; and • Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts. As of January 30, 2022, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared and 6% of our workforce in the United States was composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees. Health and COVID-19 We support our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority. During fiscal year 2022 and the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our global protocols to keep our workforce safe. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we maintained appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. We have also made some of our offices accessible based on a clearly defined set of metrics while adhering to government guidelines. Steps we took to support employees include: • Providing work from home support, including reimbursement for home office equipment and certain work from home expenses; 12 Table of Contents • Enhanced health coverage, including-COVID-19 testing, vaccine costs and support, expanded mental health resources and virtual care offerings, and care for those with COVID-19; • Learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely; and • Opportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually. We will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide “rest days” for employees to recharge.

RISK FACTORS In evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted. Our accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. These markets experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and industry standards. Our strategic and business success depends on our ability to: • timely identify emerging industry changes, and develop new or enhance existing products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets; • expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies; • accurately forecast demand in our businesses; • meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change; • manage product, software, and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction; • develop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including related to our acquisitions, customer support, e-commerce and IP licensing capabilities; and • complete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities. We make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Achieving design wins, which is important to our success in several businesses, may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers will demand. Unanticipated changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry and safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. Furthermore, a design win does not guarantee revenue. We cannot ensure that our strategic direction will result in products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, our business will be harmed. 14 Table of Contents Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue. Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies, such as the high-end discrete GPUs offered by Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which may result in lower than expected selling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, more quickly transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of IP rights that may enable such customers to develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. If we are unable to successfully compete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline. Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand, and our financial results could be harmed. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product releases and announcements, competing technologies, and other factors, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our products through channel partners, who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and demand for our products could impact our ability to properly forecast demand. GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products, and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. However, if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our gaming GPUs and limiting our ability to supply our gaming cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome. In addition, our products may be resold on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products compete with our distribution channels. Consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center, and workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand. These challenges may continue in the future when the effects of the pandemic subside. Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. We have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of the worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory. Demand for our products may be perishable or may disappear, which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause us to lose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished products and carry inventory for anticipated demand that does not materialize. We may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors. We may write-down our 15 Table of Contents inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand. Situations that may result in excess inventory or related impairments include: • changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy and changes in the credit market; • higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements; • new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases; • increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions; • fluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or • decrease in future demand, decrease in the cost of supply chain materials, or changes in the design of future products where we have entered into long-term supply commitments, including prepayments, particularly to the extent we are placing orders well in advance of our historical lead times and/or before the design of those products is final. Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. If we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we are in today, we have placed and may continue to place non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six months’ lead time, we have begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. However, we may not be able to accurately predict when such periods of shortage will end, nor do we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs. These actions may increase our product costs and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is served by our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results. We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business. We do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including: • lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner; • failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity for our products; 16 Table of Contents • failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products; • limited number of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers; • loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier; • lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules; • delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over ours; and • low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology. If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share. Our hardware and software product offerings are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. An error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic conditions, which may harm our business. We conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including: • domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business; • differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices; • domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ; • disruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and 17 Table of Contents • natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events. Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. More recently, increased inflation may impact supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs. To the extent such inflation continues, increases or both, it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Economic and industry uncertainty or changes could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: • decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers or licensees; • the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us; • our customers’ or our licensees’ inability to supply products to customers and/or end users; • the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensees; • limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions; • difficulties in obtaining capital; • reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations; • lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and • increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. We have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing located in Israel. The State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have been and could in future be the subject of an economic boycott. Other countries have and may continue in the future restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Such laws and policies may have adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy availability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical. We have facilities in regions that may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk. These measures can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations, products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and lawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased levels of capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our 18 Table of Contents operations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business. We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. Risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to: • difficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of the acquired business; • diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; • assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets; • integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles; • coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate; • difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; • difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; • Stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition; • legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; • potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions; 19 Table of Contents • the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities; • the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration; • negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate; • potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring; and • impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment. System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation. Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. For example, on February 23, 2022, we became aware of a security incident involving unauthorized access to our network by a group of independent criminal threat actors, not affiliated with any government or political cause. The threat actors obtained NVIDIA network credentials and through deception, obtained two-factor authentication capability and access to our network. The threat actors misappropriated certain NVIDIA proprietary information, including NVIDIA source code, and leaked some of that information online. Upon learning of the security incident, we engaged in remedial and preventative actions, rotated all NVIDIA network credentials to prevent further unauthorized access, hardened our network, analyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated, and notified law enforcement and other authorities. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible. Threat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Due to increasing geopolitical conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach. To defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers. We may not always be able to detect vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities. Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial 20 Table of Contents loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the invasion by Russia of Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our employees or operations both within and outside these regions, and may result in the loss of some or even all of our assets in those regions. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. For example, our operations could be harmed, and our costs could increase, if the conflict between Russia and Ukraine results in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our foundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our business may be adversely affected. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success. 21 Table of Contents Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical and they need to be scalable to support our growth, including for acquisitions of other businesses. We expect in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to commence implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. COVID-19 has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty, and the limited availability of our supply chain and logistical services, may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. While COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for certain of our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. COVID-19 containment around the world has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations could limit our capacity to meet customer demand. Stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, which could increase our costs, limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all, or cause us to hold excess inventory if demand changes. COVID-19’s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption of global financial markets, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock. We have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take further actions as required by government regulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. When we begin to reopen our offices, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, and access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration of these impacts is uncertain. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to: • our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services; 22 Table of Contents • our ability to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations; • the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers, and customer bad debt write-offs; • unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and • changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards. Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility. Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business. We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business operations negatively. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations. Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions or export control measures, which have and could in the future result in, among other things, severe or complete restrictions on exports to and other commerce and business dealings involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular entities and individuals. Such actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products, services and support into Russia or other regions determined to be supporting Russia, and restrict access by our Russian or Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our systems, negatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United States and foreign government bodies, we recently ceased product sales to Russia. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions, our employees, contractors, partners, and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. If we were ever found to have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export controls, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. The increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target products 23 Table of Contents and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions could limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively impact our business and financial results. Deemed export control limitations could negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Recent restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming business. Additionally, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Issues relating to the responsible use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability. Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and services. AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI poses emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Compliance with government regulation in the area of AI ethics may also increase the cost of related research and development. Our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational harm. Increased scrutiny from shareholders and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us. Shareholder advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have focused increasingly on the ESG and sustainability practices of companies, including those associated with climate change and human rights. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet shareholder or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and business activities may be negatively impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and talent diversity and inclusion practices. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices, or choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers, due to our policies. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could have a material negative impact on our reputation and business activities. Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. We may commence legal proceedings in order to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable 24 Table of Contents terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results. We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections. We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligations. Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability. Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims. Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and individuals may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists a proposed European regulation related to AI that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations and could require us to change our business practices. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. The United States federal, state and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. California’s privacy laws will further expand in 2023 under the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, which may restrict the use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restrict the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to impose administrative fines. Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. If we become subject to new data privacy laws the risk of enforcement action against us could increase as we become subject to additional obligations. The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is 25 Table of Contents inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition. We have exposure to tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes, including proposed changes to existing tax rules and regulations under the current U.S. administration and Congress and as a result of recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Starting in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. If Congress does not modify or repeal this provision, it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, recent proposals to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate or impose a minimum tax on financial statement income, increase U.S. taxation of international business operations and impose a global minimum tax, could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates. Numerous countries, as well as organizations such as the OECD, support the global minimum tax initiative and are considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business, which could materially impact our results of operations. Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders seeking to assert claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Our business is subject to laws and 26 Table of Contents regulations that are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. As of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575 million commercial paper program. Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, or materially change our business. We are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. Changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, restrict our ability to obtain financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing. Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to develop and sell graphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if someone makes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 11, 2022, we had approximately 313 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. On July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock, such that each stockholder of record at the close of business on June 21, 2021 received a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, or the Stock Split. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through January 30, 2022. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022. As of January 30, 2022, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. In fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of all existing 349 million treasury shares. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the retirement of our treasury shares. Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding We withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2022, we withheld approximately 8 million shares for a total value of $1.90 billion through net share settlements. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital, with withheld shares assuming the status of authorized and unissued shares. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds During fiscal year 2022, we issued a total of 175,333 shares of our common stock as consideration in connection with acquisitions, all in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), Regulation D, or Regulation S. 28 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graphs The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq 100 Index for the five years ended January 30, 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, AR and VR. Our two operating segments are ""Graphics"" and ""Compute & Networking."" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement On February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. Demand Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, transitions, competitor product releases and announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and new cryptocurrency standards can impact and have impacted in the past cryptocurrency demand, and further impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly all our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. If attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome. Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. Supply Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. To 30 Table of Contents have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build finished products and maintain inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, anticipating demand that does not materialize, or for what we believe is pent-up demand. During fiscal year 2022, we made substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. We expect to remain supply-constrained into the first half of fiscal year 2023, primarily in Gaming and Networking. We have placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain supply in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future. Ordering product in advance of our historical lead times to secure supply in a constrained environment may trigger excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is served by our competitors. Given our long lead times on inventory purchasing, demand may be perishable or may disappear. Given our current long lead times, we may order components before our product design is finalized and changes to the product design or end demand could trigger excess inventory. Our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year which could cause changes to expected revenue or cash flows. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic continued during fiscal year 2022. Most of our employees continue to work remotely and we have paused most business travel. During fiscal year 2022, our Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform also benefited from demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments. As our offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers, the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply, and the impact of rising inflation may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. Fiscal Year 2022 Summary Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 Change ($ in millions, except per share data) Revenue $ 26,914 $ 16,675 Up 61% Gross margin 64.9 % 62.3 % Up 260 bps Operating expenses $ 7,434 $ 5,864 Up 27% Income from operations $ 10,041 $ 4,532 Up 122% Net income $ 9,752 $ 4,332 Up 125% Net income per diluted share $ 3.85 $ 1.73 Up 123% We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. Revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $26.91 billion, up 61% from a year ago. Gaming revenue was up 61% from a year ago reflecting higher sales of GeForce GPUs. We continue to benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in cryptocurrency mining. 31 Table of Contents Although nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are LHR to help direct GeForce GPUs to gamers, our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining. Gamers and others are therefore able to mine cryptocurrency using our GPUs, although we have limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or method of verifying transactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability to accurately estimate it. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future. Data Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across both training and inference for cloud computing and AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models. Professional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and strong demand for workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in workloads such as 3D design, AI and rendering. Automotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in legacy cockpit revenue. OEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for the fiscal year and was nominal in the prior year. Revenue for our CMP products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above, is likely to have on future CMP sales. Gross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins also benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center. Operating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs. Income from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share were $9.75 billion and $3.85, up 125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The increase reflects operating cash flow generation and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds. We paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022. Market Platform Highlights At our November 2021 GPU Technology Conference, we announced general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise; 65 new and updated software development kits, including NVIDIA Riva, Modulus, ReOpt, Morpheus, cuNumeric, and Clara Holoscan; NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gbps switch and end-to-end networking platform; and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge AI and autonomous machines. In our Gaming platform during fiscal year 2022, we further expanded our desktop and laptop GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU line-ups; expanded the RTX ecosystem of games and applications to over 240; announced plans to integrate NVIDIA DLSS into the Unity game engine; and introduced a new high-performance membership tier to GeForce NOW. In our Data Center platform, we launched new NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs for mainstream AI, data analytics and graphics; debuted a new class of NVIDIA-Certified Systems with leading server OEMs; unveiled NVIDIA Grace, our first Arm-based data center CPU; launched the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite; unveiled the NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command AI software offerings; and announced plans to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to addressing the global climate change crisis. In our Professional Visualization platform, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX GPUs for next-generation notebook and desktop workstations; and launched NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for collaborative 3D design, digital twins and virtual worlds and NVIDIA Omniverse for Creators. 32 Table of Contents In our Automotive platform, we unveiled the NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan next-generation SOC; announced design wins with Mercedes-Benz for the AI cockpit in its new EQS sedan; with Volvo Cars for the autonomous driving computer in its next-generation cars, beginning with the XC90 in 2022; with energy vehicles from R-Auto, IM Motors, NIO, Faraday Future, VinFast and Xpeng; with robotaxis including Cruise, Amazon Zoox, Pony.ai and AutoX; with autonomous trucking companies Embark, Kodiak Robotics and Plus; formed a multi-year partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to jointly develop and deliver next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled services and experiences; and announced that Desay, Flex, Quanta, Valeo and ZF are using the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform to manufacture safe and secure AV systems for vehicle makers. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend on to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products. Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is 33 Table of Contents allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 34 Table of Contents Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. As of January 30, 2022, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.35 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $361 million and $3.99 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 35.1 37.7 Gross profit 64.9 62.3 Operating expenses: Research and development 19.6 23.5 Sales, general and administrative 8.0 11.6 Total operating expenses 27.6 35.1 Income from operations 37.3 27.2 Interest income 0.1 0.3 Interest expense (0.9) (1.1) Other, net 0.4 0.1 Other income (expense), net (0.4) (0.7) Income before income tax expense 36.9 26.5 Income tax expense 0.7 0.5 Net income 36.2 % 26.0 % 35 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Graphics $ 15,868 $ 9,834 $ 6,034 61 % Compute & Networking 11,046 6,841 4,205 61 % Total $ 26,914 $ 16,675 $ 10,239 61 % Graphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. We continue to benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in cryptocurrency mining. Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, driven primarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud computing and workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical industries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong sales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP contributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also benefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking. Inventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021. The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher-end mix within GeForce GPUs. The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a shift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive solutions. 36 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 5,268 $ 3,924 $ 1,344 34 % % of net revenue 19.6 % 23.5 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 2,166 1,940 226 12 % % of net revenue 8.0 % 11.6 % Total operating expenses $ 7,434 $ 5,864 $ 1,570 27 % Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 34% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs. Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles. Other Income (Expense), Net Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense was $236 million and $184 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021. Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in non-affiliated entities. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. 37 Table of Contents Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information, including the Domestication. Liquidity and Capital Resources January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,990 $ 847 Marketable securities 19,218 10,714 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 21,208 $ 11,561 Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,108 $ 5,822 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (9,830) $ (19,675) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 1,865 $ 3,804 As of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $9.65 billion from the end of fiscal year 2021. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio. Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by prepayments of $1.87 billion for long-term supply agreements and increases in trade receivables due to higher revenue. Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, reflecting lower payments in acquiring businesses as compared to the acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021, and higher marketable securities sales and maturities, partially offset by higher purchases of marketable securities. Cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects a debt repayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock units. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and additional supply. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements. Our marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. During fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.4 billion related to property and equipment. We have approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Following the Domestication, we 38 Table of Contents have utilized almost all of our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, resulting in higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. This will impact cash flows from operations and result in significantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Capital Return to Shareholders In fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. As of January 30, 2022, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022. Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program As of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding: • $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2023; • $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2024; • $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2026; • $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2028; • $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030; • $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2031; • $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040; • $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050; and • $500 million of Notes Due 2060. We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 30, 2022, we had not issued any commercial paper. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Contractual Obligations We have unrecognized tax benefits of $729 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $59 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 30, 2022. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively. Climate Change Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance activities. To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends. There are no material current climate change regulations impacting us, however, we are monitoring potential regulation changes in California, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions. We believe that climate change has not had a material impact to our revenue to date. We have not experienced any significant physical effects of climate change to date on our operations and results, nor any significant impacts on the cost or availability of insurance. In fiscal year 2023, we plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change and increase our purchases of Renewable Energy Credits. 39 Table of Contents Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of January 30, 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a zero percent yield floor, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $33 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $22 million, respectively. At January 30, 2022, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $103 million and $84 million lower as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized. If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $41 million and $44 million as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances. 40 Table of Contents Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of January 30, 2022, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 30, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases with the consolidated financial reporting and general ledger module to be implemented in fiscal year 2023. We will evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that affect our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 45 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 30, 2022, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $2,605 million. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California March 17, 2022 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004. 46 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. On July 19, 2021, we executed a four -for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2022 and 2020 were both 52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year. Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. 52 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Cloud Services Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Product Warranties We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Stock-based Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial 53 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) settlement payments or judgements. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $ 907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of 54 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years . Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years . Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. 55 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Leases We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. Business Combination We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used 56 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee. Marketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to require that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We early adopted this accounting standard in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the impact was immaterial. Note 2 - Business Combination Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement On February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $ 1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $ 7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack. 57 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Purchase Price Allocation The aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions): Purchase Price Cash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares (1) $ 7,033 Cash for Mellanox equity awards (2) 16 Total cash consideration 7,049 Fair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by NVIDIA (3) 85 Total purchase consideration $ 7,134 Allocation Cash and cash equivalents $ 115 Marketable securities 699 Accounts receivable, net 216 Inventories 320 Prepaid expenses and other assets 179 Property and equipment, net 144 Goodwill 3,431 Intangible assets 2,970 Accounts payable ( 136 ) Accrued and other current liabilities ( 236 ) Income tax liability ( 191 ) Deferred income tax liability ( 258 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 119 ) $ 7,134 (1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00 per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately 56 million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares. (2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox. (3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services. We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments. The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10 % for fiscal year 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2021. 58 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intangible Assets The estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets at the time of the acquisition are as follows: Fair Value Useful Lives (In millions) Developed technology (1) $ 1,640 5 years Customer relationships (2) 440 3 years Order backlog (3) 190 Based on actual shipments Trade names (4) 70 5 years Total identified finite-lived intangible assets 2,340 IPR&D (5) 630 N/A Total identified intangible assets $ 2,970 (1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. (2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method. (3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021. (4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach. (5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses. Mellanox has an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 630 million for the fair value of this project, which was initially not amortized. Instead, the project is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once and if the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life. Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for NVIDIA and Mellanox as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020: Pro Forma Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Revenue $ 17,104 $ 12,250 Net income $ 4,757 $ 2,114 The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma information presented above is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the combined business had the acquisition actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 or of the results of our future operations of the combined businesses. The pro forma results reflect the inventory step-up expense of $ 161 million in the fiscal year 2020 and were excluded from the pro forma results for fiscal year 2021. There were no other material nonrecurring adjustments. 59 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3 - Leases Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2023 and 2035. Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 30, 2022, are as follows: Operating Lease Obligations (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2023 $ 176 2024 162 2025 136 2026 124 2027 114 2028 and thereafter 288 Total 1,000 Less imputed interest 115 Present value of net future minimum lease payments 885 Less short-term operating lease liabilities 144 Long-term operating lease liabilities $ 741 In addition to our existing operating lease obligations, we have operating leases that are expected to commence within fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of 7 years for $ 169 million. Operating lease expense for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 168 million, $ 145 million, $ 114 million, respectively. Short-term and variable lease expenses for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not significant. Other information related to leases was as follows: Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Supplemental cash flows information Operating cash flows used for operating leases $ 154 $ 141 $ 103 Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (1) $ 266 $ 200 $ 238 (1) Fiscal year 2021 includes $ 80 million of operating lease assets addition due to Mellanox. As of January 30, 2022, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.1 years and a weighted average discount rate of 2.51 %. As of January 31, 2021, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.6 years and a weighted average discount rate of 2.87 %. Note 4 - Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our ESPP. 60 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows: Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Cost of revenue $ 141 $ 88 $ 39 Research and development 1,298 860 540 Sales, general and administrative 565 449 265 Total $ 2,004 $ 1,397 $ 844 Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020. The following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans: Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions, except per share data) RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Awards granted 18 36 28 Estimated total grant-date fair value $ 3,492 $ 2,764 $ 1,282 Weighted average grant-date fair value per share $ 190.69 $ 76.81 $ 46.12 ESPP Shares purchased 5 4 4 Weighted average price per share $ 56.36 $ 34.80 $ 37.19 Weighted average grant-date fair value per share $ 23.24 $ 16.91 $ 16.22 As of January 30, 2022, there was $ 4.87 billion of aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and 0.9 years for ESPP. The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions: Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (Using the Black-Scholes model) ESPP Weighted average expected life (in years) 0.1 - 2.0 0.1 - 2.0 0.1 - 2.0 Risk-free interest rate — %- 0.5 % 0.1 %- 1.6 % 1.5 %- 2.6 % Volatility 20 %- 58 % 26 %- 89 % 30 %- 82 % Dividend yield 0.1 % 0.1 %- 0.3 % 0.3 %- 0.4 % For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield. 61 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. Equity Incentive Program We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 30, 2022, up to 50 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 6 million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 30, 2022, there were 131 million shares available for future grants. Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25 % vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5 % vesting quarterly thereafter. PSUs vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25 % vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100 % on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria. Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the 2012 Plan. Employees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15 % of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months . The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85 % of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 30, 2022, we had 233 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan. 62 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Equity Award Activity The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In millions, except per share data) Balances, January 31, 2021 59 $ 66.17 Granted 18 $ 190.69 Vested restricted stock ( 29 ) $ 66.67 Canceled and forfeited ( 2 ) $ 86.47 Balances, January 30, 2022 46 $ 114.19 Vested and expected to vest after January 30, 2022 46 $ 113.84 As of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, there were 131 million and 148 million shares, respectively, of common stock available for future grants under our equity incentive plans.

This excludes revenue related to performance obligations for contracts with a length of one year or less. 69 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021: January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) Designated as cash flow hedges $ 1,023 $ 840 Non-designated hedges $ 408 $ 441 As of January 30, 2022, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months . The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Note 12 - Debt Long-Term Debt In June 2021, March 2020, and September 2016, we issued a total of $ 5.00 billion, $ 5.00 billion, and $ 2.00 billion aggregate principal of senior notes, respectively. The net proceeds from these offerings were $ 4.98 billion, $ 4.97 billion, and $ 1.98 billion, respectively, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. On August 16, 2021, we repaid the $ 1.00 billion of 2.20 % Notes Due 2021. All of our notes are unsecured senior obligations. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the notes. Our notes pay interest semi-annually. We may redeem each of our notes prior to maturity, subject to a make-whole premium as defined in the applicable form of note. 70 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The carrying value of the Notes, the calendar year of maturity, and the associated interest rates were as follows: Expected Remaining Term (years) Effective Interest Rate January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) 2.20 % Notes Due 2021 — 2.38 % $ — $ 1,000 0.309 % Notes Due 2023 1.4 0.41 % 1,250 — 0.584 % Notes Due 2024 2.4 0.66 % 1,250 — 3.20 % Notes Due 2026 4.6 3.31 % 1,000 1,000 1.55 % Notes Due 2028 6.4 1.64 % 1,250 — 2.85 % Notes Due 2030 8.2 2.93 % 1,500 1,500 2.00 % Notes Due 2031 9.4 2.09 % 1,250 — 3.50 % Notes Due 2040 18.2 3.54 % 1,000 1,000 3.50 % Notes Due 2050 28.2 3.54 % 2,000 2,000 3.70 % Notes Due 2060 38.2 3.73 % 500 500 Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs ( 54 ) ( 37 ) Net carrying amount 10,946 6,963 Less short-term portion — ( 999 ) Total long-term portion $ 10,946 $ 5,964 As of January 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the required covenants under the Notes.

Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations primarily include our commitments to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including long-term supply agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets. We have entered into several long-term supply agreements, under which we have made advance payments and have $ 1.58 billion remaining unpaid. As of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations totaling $ 9.00 billion, inclusive of the $ 1.58 billion, and other purchase obligations totaling $ 1.30 billion. Total future unconditional purchase commitments as of January 30, 2022, are as follows: Commitments (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2023 $ 9,302 2024 765 2025 201 2026 28 Total $ 10,296 71 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In March 2022, we entered into a supply agreement with payments of $ 670 million to be paid over nine years . Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities The estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $ 46 million and $ 22 million as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included IP indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability for such indemnifications. Litigation Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation , filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument is scheduled for May 10, 2022. The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation , was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures. Accounting for Loss Contingencies As of January 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. 72 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 14 - Income Taxes The income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Current income taxes: Federal $ 482 $ 197 $ 65 State 42 1 4 Foreign 71 161 87 Total current 595 359 156 Deferred taxes: Federal ( 420 ) ( 246 ) 2 Foreign 14 ( 36 ) 16 Total deferred ( 406 ) ( 282 ) 18 Income tax expense $ 189 $ 77 $ 174 Income before income tax consists of the following: Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Domestic (1) $ 8,446 $ 1,437 $ 620 Foreign 1,495 2,972 2,350 Income before income tax $ 9,941 $ 4,409 $ 2,970 (1) Fiscal year 2022 domestic income before income tax increased as compared to fiscal years 2021 and 2020 due to the Domestication in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. 73 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes as follows: Year Ended January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Tax expense computed at federal statutory rate $ 2,088 $ 926 $ 624 Expense (benefit) resulting from: State income taxes, net of federal tax effect 42 10 12 Foreign-derived intangible income ( 520 ) — — Foreign tax rate differential ( 497 ) ( 561 ) ( 301 ) Stock-based compensation ( 337 ) ( 136 ) ( 60 ) U.S. federal R&D tax credit ( 289 ) ( 173 ) ( 110 ) IP domestication ( 244 ) — — Other ( 54 ) 11 9 Income tax expense $ 189 $ 77 $ 174 The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below: January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Research and other tax credit carryforwards $ 798 $ 650 Property, equipment and intangible assets 530 32 GILTI deferred tax assets 378 709 Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes 258 59 Operating lease liabilities 125 120 Net operating loss carryforwards 118 100 Stock-based compensation 86 36 Other deferred tax assets 22 — Gross deferred tax assets 2,315 1,706 Less valuation allowance ( 907 ) ( 728 ) Total deferred tax assets 1,408 978 Deferred tax liabilities: Acquired intangibles ( 169 ) ( 191 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 150 ) ( 111 ) Operating lease assets ( 113 ) ( 111 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities ( 432 ) ( 413 ) Net deferred tax asset (1) $ 976 $ 565 (1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $ 1.22 billion and $ 806 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $ 245 million and $ 241 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized income tax expense of $ 189 million, $ 77 million, and $ 174 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9 %, 1.7 %, and 5.9 % for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an 74 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and the discrete benefit of the Domestication. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. On June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP to the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more closely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax laws. The impact of the Domestication, which is regarded as a change in tax status, resulted in a discrete benefit primarily from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $ 244 million in fiscal year 2022. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time benefits of the Domestication. Our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $ 256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $ 153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. As of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.05 billion and $ 232 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable. As of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $ 907 million and $ 728 million, respectively, related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. As of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 397 million, $ 345 million and $ 341 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 341 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 102 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 1.24 billion, of which $ 1.18 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $ 55 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization. As of January 30, 2022, we had $ 1.01 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $ 808 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $ 181 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $ 808 million of net unrecognized tax benefits as of January 30, 2022 consisted of $ 670 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $ 138 million reflected as a net reduction to the deferred tax assets. 75 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: January 30, 2022 January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 776 $ 583 $ 477 Increases in tax positions for current year 246 158 104 Increases in tax positions for prior years (1) 14 60 7 Decreases in tax positions for prior years ( 4 ) ( 11 ) — Settlements ( 8 ) ( 5 ) — Lapse in statute of limitations ( 11 ) ( 9 ) ( 5 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,013 $ 776 $ 583 (1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the Mellanox acquisition. We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 30, 2022, January 31, 2021, and January 26, 2020, we had accrued $ 59 million, $ 44 million, and $ 31 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 30, 2022, unrecognized tax benefits of $ 670 million and the related interest and penalties of $ 59 million are included in non-current income taxes payable. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 30, 2022, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 30, 2022, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2021. As of January 30, 2022, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany, India, Israel, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2019. Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity Capital Return Program Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Through January 30, 2022, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $ 7.08 billion. As of January 30, 2022, we have a remaining authorization, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24 billion through December 2022. From January 31, 2022 through March 17, 2022, we repurchased 7.7 million shares of our common stock for $ 1.75 billion. During fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid $ 399 million, $ 395 million, and $ 390 million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of our existing 349 million treasury shares. These shares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $ 20 million and retained earnings by $ 12.0 billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares. 76 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 168 million, $ 120 million, and $ 76 million, respectively. Note 17 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

Our GPU computing solutions enhance productivity and introduce new capabilities for critical parts of the workflow for such major industries as automotive, media and entertainment, architectural engineering, oil and gas, and medical imaging. Designers who build the products we use every day need the images that they view digitally to mirror reality. This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering. Our DesignWorks software delivers this to designers and enables an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. It also allows an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models. Our Professional Visualization platforms are critical enablers in many fields, such as design and manufacturing and digital content creation. Design and manufacturing encompass computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video editing and post-production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics. The NVIDIA RTX platform makes it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and environments with physically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time. Many leading 3D design and content creation applications developed by our ecosystem partners now support RTX, allowing professionals to accelerate and transform their workflows with NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise applications. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life all deploy this technology, powered by our GPUs.

Seasonality Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as enterprise and cloud data centers, consumer gaming, professional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue. Manufacturing We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd. to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix. We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions. We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as Flex Ltd. and Fabrinet, and ODMs such as Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key 9 Table of Contents elements such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process. Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, including Intel’s recent announcement that they will introduce high performance GPUs, embedded SOCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in our fiscal year 2022. Our current competitors include: • suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, and Xilinx, Inc.; • large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc. and Amazon, Inc.; • suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, and Xilinx or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and • suppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, Marvell Technology Group, and Xilinx, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon. Patents and Proprietary Rights We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2021 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as: • the location in which our products are manufactured; • our strategic technology or product directions in different countries; • the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and • the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions. 10 Table of Contents We have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements. Government Regulations Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts. Human Capital Management We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of January 31, 2021, we had 18,975 employees in 29 countries. 13,532 were engaged in research and development and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development personnel. The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized below, in addition to an overview of employee programs we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment The demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our intern and new college graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner with higher education institutions globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our employees to submit referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal recommendations. Collaborations with our community resource groups improve how we reach and attract minority candidates. Development and Retention To support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based forums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning libraries around our most common development needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly listen to learner feedback through internal messaging channels to improve and update those topics. We offer tuition reimbursement programs and subsidize advanced technical education programs and online technical certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide trained coaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource groups allow us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs. To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline. In fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%. Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the company’s future. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations) that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents. Diversity and Inclusion 11 Table of Contents We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability. We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic candidates. In fiscal year 2021, we created the role of Head of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, along with hiring a global diversity recruiting leader, and a Head of Strategic Initiatives to build our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents the global population. Efforts we are undertaking include: • Shepherding underrepresented candidates through the interviewing process, engaging employees from underrepresented communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased investment in minority-serving institutions and professional organizations. • Developing an internal slate of diverse talent for all open management positions, beginning semi-annual talent review sessions with executives to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming sponsorship and career acceleration programs. • Increasing inclusion communications and pulse surveys to measure employee sentiment. As of January 31, 2021, our global workforce was 80% male and 20% female, and 6% of our workforce in the United States was composed of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino employees. Safety and COVID-19 We support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global protocols to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around the world in March 2020 for all except essential workers. We also eliminated most business travel. We provided our employees with resources to work remotely and continued to pay all employees and contractors. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we instituted appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, we provided resources for employees, including work from home support, enhanced health coverage, reimbursement for certain work from home expenses, and learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely.

RISK FACTORS In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted. Our GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. For example, we must continue to accurately forecast demand, scale and optimize utilization in our data center business, and develop and deliver next-generation autonomous driving solutions to our partners and customers or our business could be negatively impacted. We also must continue to scale our networking business following the Mellanox acquisition by leveraging our joint product capabilities and continuing to effectively integrate company processes. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support, e-commerce and intellectual property, or IP, licensing capabilities. If we do not continue to evolve our business, including by developing 13 Table of Contents market specific technologies, managing the social and environmental impact of our products and technologies, expanding the ecosystem for our current and future products and technologies, and monetizing and expanding our business in various areas, our financial results could be negatively impacted. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change, including those applicable to our automotive solutions and systems. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners, and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed. For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor, including for our interconnect products. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. Additionally, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Furthermore, winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any. Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue. Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them. Consequently, these customers may become competitors to us. Further, each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation. If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results. Risks Related to Our Supply and Manufacturing We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business. We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. In the past we have not had and going forward we may not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. Nevertheless, we may enter into long-term procurement and capacity commitments 14 Table of Contents as our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain. As our business grows, we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our business. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, scale our supply chain and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including: • a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices, which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in sufficient quantities and/or in a timely manner; • a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate, or any, manufacturing or test capacity for our products; • a failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis; • a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers; • loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier; • a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and • delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise. In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed. If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share. Our products, including both hardware and software offerings, are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write-off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in 15 Table of Contents failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or recalls due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. Risks Related to Our Operating Business If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed. Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include: • changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy; • changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market; • a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products; • a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements; • our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products; • less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or • increased competition, including competitive pricing actions. The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results. 16 Table of Contents Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged. System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation. Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of our third party software service providers, was subject to a data security breach. To date, our investigations of this breach, which were supported by a third party expert, have not identified any adverse impact to NVIDIA. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted. Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics (including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement 17 Table of Contents could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political or social unrest, elections and post-election developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, other negative impacts from climate change, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. It continues to affect our business in both positive and negative ways, and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform benefited from work-from-home trends in mobile workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In our Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. A significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our headquarters is located in California. Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees continue to work remotely. There is no 18 Table of Contents certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. While the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or treat its impact, availability of vaccines or other treatments, further related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain. We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or investments, including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion in April 2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Furthermore, if we are unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner, including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. In addition, we have made and may in the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to: • difficulty in combining the technology, products, or operations of the acquired business with our business; • difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees; • diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; • assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets; • integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles; • coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated; • acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating international operations and joint ventures; • difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all; • difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other approvals or financing; 19 Table of Contents • the potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an acquisition; • the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition; • failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment; • legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; • the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities; • the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration; • uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; • negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate; • the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations; • potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and • impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because: • most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty; • our partners may develop their own solutions; • our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or • our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products. We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade restrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient. We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic conditions, which may harm our business. We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue 20 Table of Contents to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 81% of total revenue for fiscal year 2021, 92% for fiscal year 2020 and 87% for fiscal year 2019. Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 23% of our revenue for fiscal year 2021. Additionally, as of January 31, 2021, approximately 53% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including: • international economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in which we do business; • unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws and employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions; • differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices; • local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations; • exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; • disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; • increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits; and • natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations,” above), and other catastrophic events. If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted. We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is likely that the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A slowdown in economic growth could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the 21 Table of Contents inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on inventories. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. Additionally, we have engineering facilities, corporate and sales support operations and some of our manufacturing located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the Middle East may directly affect our business. In addition, the State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have in the past been the subject of an economic boycott and could be in the future. Other countries have in the past, and may continue in the future, to restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Further, we are unable to ship products manufactured in Israel to certain countries. These laws and policies may have an impact on our results of operations. Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We continue to evolve our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources to our employees who are working remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the essential labs and offices that remain open. If we do not continue to anticipate and address the safety and wellness needs of our employees sufficiently and/or in a timely manner, their productivity could be impacted, or we could fail to retain them. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors, other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to: • our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products; • our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services; • fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID-19, as discussed further in the risk factor “If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed;” 22 Table of Contents • changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products; • our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing; • our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations; • product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; • our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards; • supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products; • inventory write-downs; • our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies; • our dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products, including InfiniBand; • the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers; • customer bad debt write-offs; • any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; • unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property; • our ability to maintain and scale our business processes, information systems and internal controls; • changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and • general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets. Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility. Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results. 23 Table of Contents Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our intellectual property if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections. Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims. Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which required companies to meet requirements effective as of May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. California’s privacy laws will expand substantially effective January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. Since the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the states in the United States and the United States Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity. We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may 24 Table of Contents disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA. Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. For example, we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. In addition, multiple stockholders, purporting to act on our behalf, filed derivative lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations. Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following: • the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval; • the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; • advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; • the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval; • a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; • the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and • the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws. 25 Table of Contents On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes. Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Additionally, our obligation to make payments related to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California. It includes ten leased commercial buildings totaling 1,019,887 square feet, and real property that we own totaling 720,046 square feet. Our owned property consists of two commercial buildings and a building under construction. The construction is targeted for completion in fiscal year 2023. In addition, we also lease data center space in Santa Clara, California. Outside of Santa Clara, California, we lease facilities in a number of regional facilities in other U.S. locations that are used as research and development centers and/or sales and administrative offices. Outside of the United States, we own a building in Hyderabad, India, that is being used primarily as a research and development center. We also lease facilities in various international locations that are used as research and development centers and/or sales and administrative offices. These leased facilities are located primarily in Asia, Europe, and Israel. In addition, we also lease data center space in various locations around the world. We believe that we currently have sufficient facilities to conduct our operations for the next twelve months. We do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment.

Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 19, 2021, we had approximately 303 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through January 31, 2021. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. In fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021. Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2021, we withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $942 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans. 27 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graphs The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq 100 Index for the five years ended January 31, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI. Through fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. We changed our reportable segments to ""Graphics"" and ""Compute & Networking"" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. All prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments. Our market platforms – Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022. Demand Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made 29 Table of Contents by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. COVID-19 The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Since March 2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel. Our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. In Professional Visualization, mobile workstations continue to benefit from work-from-home trends, and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In Automotive, COVID is no longer having a significant impact on demand. Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information under the heading “Risk Factors”. We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 Change ($ in millions, except per share data) Revenue $ 16,675 $ 10,918 Up 53% Gross margin 62.3 % 62.0 % Up 30 bps Operating expenses $ 5,864 $ 3,922 Up 50% Income from operations $ 4,532 $ 2,846 Up 59% Net income $ 4,332 $ 2,796 Up 55% Net income per diluted share $ 6.90 $ 4.52 Up 53% Revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $16.68 billion, up 53% from a year earlier. 30 Table of Contents From a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was up 41% from a year ago, reflecting higher sales across desktop and laptop GPUs for gaming, and game-console SOCs. GPUs for gaming benefited from the ramp of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. Professional Visualization revenue was down 13% from a year ago due to lower sales of GPUs for desktop workstations as enterprise demand was impacted by COVID. Data Center revenue was up 124% from a year ago. Revenue growth was driven by our Mellanox acquisition and the ramp of the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In fiscal year 2021, Mellanox revenue contributed 10% of total company revenue. Automotive revenue was down 23% from a year earlier, reflecting lower revenue from the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements, partially offset by increases in AI cockpit and autonomous vehicle solutions. OEM and Other revenue was up 25% from a year ago, primarily due to higher volume of entry-level laptop GPUs. Gross margin for fiscal year 2021 was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges. Operating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $5.86 billion, up 50% from a year ago. The growth was influenced by the inclusion of Mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, employee additions and increases in employee compensation and related expenses. Additionally, acquisition-related and other costs of $411 million primarily include $190 million in non-recurring intangible amortization of Mellanox order backlog, $123 million in recurring amortization of Mellanox intangible assets, and $40 million related to the pending acquisition of Arm. Income from operations for fiscal year 2021 was $4.53 billion, up 59% from a year earlier. Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2021 were $4.33 billion and $6.90, up 55% and 53%, respectively, from a year earlier. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.56 billion as of January 31, 2021, compared with $10.90 billion as of January 26, 2020. The increase primarily reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March 2020 and cash-flow generation, partially offset by acquisitions. We paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2021. Market Platform Highlights During fiscal year 2021, in our Gaming platform, we announced the launch of new laptop models powered by NVIDIA GeForce GPUs; unveiled GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs including our second generation NVIDIA RTX; expanded NVIDIA GeForce NOW; announced that a range of games now support NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and DLSS AI super resolution; unveiled NVIDIA Reflex and NVIDIA Broadcast; expanded the RTX Studio lineup powered by new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs; and released DLSS 2.0.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to business combinations, inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Business Combinations The application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analyses. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period of resolution, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our assessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or 32 Table of Contents unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products. Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change 33 Table of Contents based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We changed our reportable segments to ""Graphics"" and ""Compute & Networking"" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $3.85 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com. 34 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 37.7 38.0 Gross profit 62.3 62.0 Operating expenses: Research and development 23.5 25.9 Sales, general and administrative 11.6 10.0 Total operating expenses 35.1 35.9 Income from operations 27.2 26.1 Interest income 0.3 1.6 Interest expense (1.1) (0.5) Other, net 0.1 — Other income (expense), net (0.7) 1.1 Income before income tax expense 26.5 27.2 Income tax expense 0.5 1.6 Net income 26.0 % 25.6 % Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Graphics $ 9,834 $ 7,639 $ 2,195 29 % Compute & Networking 6,841 3,279 3,562 109 % Total $ 16,675 $ 10,918 $ 5,757 53 % Graphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 29% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting growth in GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro/NVIDIA RTX workstations. Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 109% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture systems and new products. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81% and 92% of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021. Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of 35 Table of Contents revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 62.3% and 62.0% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2021 was driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of $263 million. Inventory provisions totaled $116 million and $161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix within Quadro/Nvidia RTX. Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by the addition of Mellanox products, higher margins in Data Center compute systems, and lower product mix of certain Automotive solutions. Operating Expenses Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 3,924 $ 2,829 $ 1,095 39 % % of net revenue 23.5 % 25.9 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 1,940 1,093 847 77 % % of net revenue 11.6 % 10.0 % Total operating expenses $ 5,864 $ 3,922 $ 1,942 50 % Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 39% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven primarily by the acquisition of Mellanox. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs. Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 77% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation. Other Income (Expense), Net Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $57 million and $178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $184 million and $52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7% and 5.9% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. 36 Table of Contents The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 847 $ 10,896 Marketable securities 10,714 1 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 11,561 $ 10,897 Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,822 $ 4,761 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (19,675) $ 6,145 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 3,804 $ (792) As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $664 million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm, which was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion, the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The cash flow allocation of the payment resulted in $1.36 billion of advanced consideration included in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $0.17 billion for the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and $0.47 billion in prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets. Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, due to higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital include increases in purchases of inventory and outstanding trade receivables, both due to higher fiscal year 2021 revenue, and a prepayment of royalties to Arm. Cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed acquisition of Arm, higher purchases of marketable securities, higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, and lower sales of marketable securities, offset by higher maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, offset by payments related to tax on restricted stock units. 37 Table of Contents Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including our proposed acquisition of Arm. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements beyond twelve months. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, and certificates of deposits. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. During fiscal year 2022, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion related to property and equipment, including construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus. We have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2021 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Capital Return to Shareholders In fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. As of January 31, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021. Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities We have outstanding $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. We have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes. We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 31, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement. We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we had not issued any commercial paper. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Contractual Obligations We have $157 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax benefits of $395 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $43 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 31, 2021. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 38 Table of Contents For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of January 31, 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a yield floor of 0%, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $24 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $8 million, respectively. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $84 million and $43 million lower as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized. 39 Table of Contents If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $44 million and $29 million as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The information required by this Item is set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of January 31, 2021, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting despite the fact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their operating effectiveness. We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal year 2020. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 44 Table of Contents management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd.- Valuation of Developed Technology and In-process Research and Development Intangible Assets Acquired As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2021 the Company completed the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. for consideration of approximately $7.13 billion, of which $1,640 million of developed technology and $630 million of in-process research and development intangible assets were recorded. The fair values of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. As disclosed by management, management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, the technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate, (ii) significant audit effort in evaluating management’s assumptions relating to the estimate, such as revenue growth and the technology migration curve, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible assets and controls over development of the assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration curve. These procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement and testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration curve for the intangible assets acquired, and using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist with the evaluation. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth involved considering the past performance of the acquired business as well as economic and industry forecasts. The technology migration curve was evaluated by considering the revenue attribution between existing technology and in-process research and development based on the assessment of the separation of forecasted future revenue between developed products and new generation products and the technology carryover rate. Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As 45 Table of Contents disclosed by management, the inventory provisions developed include assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As of January 31, 2021, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $1,826 million. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California February 26, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004. 46 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were both 52-week years. Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. 52 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Product Warranties We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Stock-based Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. 53 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $ 728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. We generally classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses 54 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for expected losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years . Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years . Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Leases We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease 55 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired intellectual property. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from two to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. Business Combination We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. 56 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 - Business Combination Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $ 40 billion. We paid $ 2 billion in Signing Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $ 10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $ 21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional $ 5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $ 1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $ 2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $ 1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $ 0.17 billion and royalties of $ 0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $ 1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $ 2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022. Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $ 7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack. 57 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Purchase Price Allocation The aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions): Purchase Price Cash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares (1) $ 7,033 Cash for Mellanox equity awards (2) 16 Total cash consideration 7,049 Fair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by NVIDIA (3) 85 Total purchase consideration $ 7,134 Allocation Cash and cash equivalents $ 115 Marketable securities 699 Accounts receivable, net 216 Inventories 320 Prepaid expenses and other assets 179 Property and equipment, net 144 Goodwill 3,431 Intangible assets 2,970 Accounts payable ( 136 ) Accrued and other current liabilities ( 236 ) Income tax liability ( 191 ) Deferred income tax liability ( 258 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 119 ) $ 7,134 (1) Represents the cash consideration of $ 125.00 per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately 56 million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares. (2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox. (3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services. We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments. The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10 % for fiscal year 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $ 28 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2021. 58 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intangible Assets The estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets are as follows: Fair Value Useful Lives (In millions) Developed technology (1) $ 1,640 5 years Customer relationships (2) 440 3 years Order backlog (3) 190 Based on actual shipments Trade names (4) 70 5 years Total identified finite-lived intangible assets 2,340 IPR&D (5) 630 N/A Total identified intangible assets $ 2,970 (1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. (2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method. (3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021. (4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach. (5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses. Mellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 630 million for the fair value of this project, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, the project will be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life. Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for NVIDIA and Mellanox as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020: Pro Forma Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Revenue $ 17,104 $ 12,250 Net income $ 4,757 $ 2,114 The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma information presented above is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the combined business had the acquisition actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 or of the results of our future operations of the combined businesses. The pro forma results reflect the inventory step-up expense of $ 161 million in the fiscal year 2020 and were excluded from the pro forma results for fiscal year 2021. There were no other material nonrecurring adjustments. Note 3 - Leases 59 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) On January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method. Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2022 and 2035. Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 31, 2021, are as follows: Operating Lease Obligations (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2022 $ 152 2023 135 2024 115 2025 94 2026 86 2027 and thereafter 288 Total 870 Less imputed interest 115 Present value of net future minimum lease payments 755 Less short-term operating lease liabilities 121 Long-term operating lease liabilities $ 634 Operating lease expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 145 million, $ 114 million, $ 80 million, respectively. Short-term and variable lease expenses for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were not significant. Other information related to leases was as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Supplemental cash flows information Operating cash flows used for operating leases $ 141 $ 103 Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations (1) $ 200 $ 238 (1) Fiscal year 2021 includes $ 80 million of operating lease assets addition due to a business combination. As of January 31, 2021, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.6 years and a weighted average discount rate of 2.87 %. As of January 26, 2020, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.3 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.45 %. Note 4 - Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our ESPP. 60 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Cost of revenue $ 88 $ 39 $ 27 Research and development 860 540 336 Sales, general and administrative 449 265 194 Total $ 1,397 $ 844 $ 557 Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. The following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans: Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions, except per share data) RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Awards granted 9 7 4 Estimated total grant-date fair value $ 2,764 $ 1,282 $ 1,109 Weighted average grant-date fair value per share $ 307.25 $ 184.47 $ 258.26 ESPP Shares purchased 1 1 1 Weighted average price per share $ 139.19 $ 148.76 $ 107.48 Weighted average grant-date fair value per share $ 67.65 $ 64.87 $ 38.51 As of January 31, 2021, there was $ 3.17 billion of aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and 0.9 years for ESPP. The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions: Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (Using the Black-Scholes model) ESPP Weighted average expected life (in years) 0.1 - 2.0 0.1 - 2.0 0.1 - 2.0 Risk-free interest rate 0.1 %- 1.6 % 1.5 %- 2.6 % 1.6 %- 2.8 % Volatility 26 %- 89 % 30 %- 82 % 24 %- 75 % Dividend yield 0.1 %- 0.3 % 0.3 %- 0.4 % 0.3 %- 0.4 % For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield. 61 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. Equity Incentive Program We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed the stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and substituted them with our RSUs. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 31, 2021, up to 244 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 2 million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by May 2024 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 31, 2021, there were 37 million shares available for future issuance. Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25 % vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5 % vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100 % on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria. Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan. Employees who participate may have up to 10 % of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock. Starting in March 2021, employees who participate may have up to 15 % of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months . The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85 % of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 31, 2021, we had 60 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan. 62 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Equity Award Activity The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In millions, except years and per share data) Balances, January 26, 2020 14 $ 176.72 Granted 9 $ 307.25 Vested restricted stock ( 7 ) $ 159.35 Canceled and forfeited ( 1 ) $ 193.83 Balances, January 31, 2021 15 $ 264.69 Vested and expected to vest after January 31, 2021 14 $ 264.13 As of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, there were 37 million and 29 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. As of January 31, 2021, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $ 1.20 billion, with an average exercise price of $ 14.40 per share and an average remaining term of 1.7 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 521 million, $ 84 million, and $ 180 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Upon the exercise of an option, we issue new shares of stock. The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, was $ 2.67 billion, $ 1.45 billion, and $ 2.62 billion, respectively. Note 5 - Net Income Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions, except per share data) Numerator: Net income $ 4,332 $ 2,796 $ 4,141 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares 617 609 608 Dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards 11 9 17 Diluted weighted average shares 628 618 625 Net income per share: Basic (1) $ 7.02 $ 4.59 $ 6.81 Diluted (2) $ 6.90 $ 4.52 $ 6.63 Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive 3 11 5 (1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares. (2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares. 63 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6 - Goodwill We changed our reportable segments to ""Graphics"" and ""Compute & Networking"" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, as discussed in Note 17 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. Comparative periods presented reflect this change. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 4.19 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $ 347 million and $ 3.85 billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $ 618 million and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $ 347 million and $ 271 million, respectively. Goodwill increased by $ 3.57 billion in fiscal year 2021 due to goodwill of $ 3.43 billion arising from the Mellanox acquisition, and goodwill of $ 143 million from other acquisition activities, all of which were allocated to the Compute & Networking reporting unit. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was no t impaired in any of these years. Note 7 - Amortizable Intangible Assets The components of our amortizable intangible assets are as follows: January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount (In millions) (In millions) Acquisition-related intangible assets (1) $ 3,280 $ ( 774 ) $ 2,506 $ 195 $ ( 192 ) $ 3 Patents and licensed technology 706 ( 475 ) 231 520 ( 474 ) 46 Total intangible assets $ 3,986 $ ( 1,249 ) $ 2,737 $ 715 $ ( 666 ) $ 49 (1) As of January 31, 2021, acquisition-related intangible assets include the fair value of a Mellanox IPR&D project of $ 630 million, which has not been amortized. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life. Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 612 million, $ 25 million, and $ 29 million, respectively. Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of January 31, 2021 is estimated to be $ 548 million in fiscal year 2022, $ 545 million in fiscal year 2023, $ 423 million in fiscal year 2024, $ 367 million in fiscal year 2025, $ 97 million in fiscal year 2026, and $ 757 million in fiscal year 2027 and thereafter.

This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of January 31, 2021, the amount of our remaining performance that has not been recognized as revenue was $ 683 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 44 % as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020: January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Designated as cash flow hedges $ 840 $ 428 Not designated for hedge accounting $ 441 $ 287 As of January 31, 2021, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months . The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness. Note 12 - Debt Long-Term Debt In March 2020, we issued $ 1.50 billion of the 2.85 % Notes Due 2030, $ 1.00 billion of the 3.50 % Notes Due 2040, $ 2.00 billion of the 3.50 % Notes Due 2050, and $ 500 million of the 3.70 % Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. Interest on the March 2020 Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2020. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2030 on or after January 1, 2030, the Notes Due 2040 on or after October 1, 2039, the Notes Due 2050 on or after October 1, 2049, or the Notes Due 2060 on or after October 1, 2059. The net proceeds from the March 2020 Notes were $ 4.97 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. In September 2016, we issued $ 1.00 billion of the 2.20 % Notes Due 2021, and $ 1.00 billion of the 3.20 % Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes. Interest on the September 2016 Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $ 1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. 69 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Both the September 2016 Notes and the March 2020 Notes, or collectively, the Notes, are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes. The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows: Expected Remaining Term (years) Effective Interest Rate January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) 2.20 % Notes Due 2021 0.6 2.38 % $ 1,000 $ 1,000 3.20 % Notes Due 2026 5.6 3.31 % 1,000 1,000 2.85 % Notes Due 2030 9.2 2.93 % 1,500 — 3.50 % Notes Due 2040 19.2 3.54 % 1,000 — 3.50 % Notes Due 2050 29.2 3.54 % 2,000 — 3.70 % Notes Due 2060 39.2 3.73 % 500 — Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs ( 37 ) ( 9 ) Net carrying amount 6,963 1,991 Less short-term portion ( 999 ) — Total long-term portion $ 5,964 $ 1,991 As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the required covenants under the Notes. Credit Facilities We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $ 575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $ 425 million. As of January 31, 2021, we had no t borrowed any amounts and were in compliance with the required covenants under this agreement. The Credit Agreement expires October 2021. We have a $ 575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we had no t issued any commercial paper. Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations As of January 31, 2021, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $ 2.54 billion, which are expected to occur over the next 12 months, and other purchase obligations totaling $ 317 million, which are primarily expected to occur over the next 18 months. Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities The estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $ 22 million and $ 15 million as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability for such indemnifications. Litigation Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation 70 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserts that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On June 29, 2020, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the individual defendants. As of September 14, 2020, the motion was fully briefed but the Court has not yet issued a decision. The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures. It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants. Accounting for Loss Contingencies As of January 31, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. 71 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 14 - Income Taxes The income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Current income taxes: Federal $ 197 $ 65 $ 1 State 1 4 — Foreign 161 87 69 Total current 359 156 70 Deferred taxes: Federal ( 246 ) 2 ( 315 ) Foreign ( 36 ) 16 — Total deferred ( 282 ) 18 ( 315 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 77 $ 174 $ ( 245 ) Income before income tax consists of the following: Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Domestic $ 1,437 $ 620 $ 1,843 Foreign 2,972 2,350 2,053 Income before income tax $ 4,409 $ 2,970 $ 3,896 The income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Tax expense computed at federal statutory rate $ 926 $ 624 $ 818 Expense (benefit) resulting from: State income taxes, net of federal tax effect 10 12 23 Foreign tax rate differential ( 561 ) ( 301 ) ( 412 ) U.S. federal R&D tax credit ( 173 ) ( 110 ) ( 141 ) Stock-based compensation ( 136 ) ( 60 ) ( 191 ) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — — ( 368 ) Other 11 9 26 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 77 $ 174 $ ( 245 ) 72 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below: January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: GILTI deferred tax assets $ 709 $ 428 Research and other tax credit carryforwards 650 605 Operating lease liabilities 120 114 Net operating loss carryforwards 100 62 Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes 59 39 Stock-based compensation 36 28 Property, equipment and intangible assets 32 12 Gross deferred tax assets 1,706 1,288 Less valuation allowance ( 728 ) ( 621 ) Total deferred tax assets 978 667 Deferred tax liabilities: Acquired intangibles ( 191 ) ( 1 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 111 ) ( 40 ) Operating lease assets ( 111 ) ( 107 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities ( 413 ) ( 148 ) Net deferred tax asset (1) $ 565 $ 519 (1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $ 806 million and $ 548 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $ 241 million and $ 29 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized an income tax expense of $ 77 million and $ 174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and income tax benefit of $ 245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7 %, 5.9 %, and ( 6.3 )% for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $ 256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $ 153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred tax liabilities and long-term tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price allocation. As a result of the acquisition, as of January 31, 2021, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $ 1.16 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable. As of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $ 728 million and $ 621 million, respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax 73 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. As of January 31, 2021, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 333 million, $ 308 million and $ 344 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 344 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 31, 2021, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 238 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2035. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 987 million, of which $ 944 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $ 43 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2022. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization. As of January 31, 2021, we had $ 776 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $ 606 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $ 132 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $ 606 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2021 consisted of $ 352 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable, $ 5 million recorded in current income taxes payable, and $ 249 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets. A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 583 $ 477 $ 447 Increases in tax positions for current year 158 104 129 Increases in tax positions for prior years (1) 60 7 52 Decreases in tax positions for prior years ( 11 ) — ( 141 ) Settlements ( 5 ) — — Lapse in statute of limitations ( 9 ) ( 5 ) ( 10 ) Balance at end of period $ 776 $ 583 $ 477 (1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the Mellanox acquisition. We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, we had accrued $ 44 million, $ 31 million, and $ 21 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 31, 2021, unrecognized tax benefits of $ 352 million and the related interest and penalties of $ 43 million are included in non-current income taxes payable, and unrecognized tax benefits of $ 5 million and the related interest and penalties of $ 1 million are included in current income taxes payable. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 31, 2021, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. 74 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 31, 2021, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, and India for fiscal years 2005 through 2020. As of January 31, 2021, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India, for fiscal years 2005 through 2019. Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity Capital Return Program Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Through January 31, 2021, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $ 7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24 billion through December 2022. During fiscal year 2021, we paid $ 395 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 120 million, $ 76 million, and $ 70 million, respectively. Note 17 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported two operating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in which our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The two new operating segments are ""Graphics"" and ""Compute & Networking"". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category. 75 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Graphics Compute & Networking All Other Consolidated (In millions) Year Ended January 31, 2021: Revenue $ 9,834 $ 6,841 $ — $ 16,675 Operating income (loss) $ 4,612 $ 2,548 $ ( 2,628 ) $ 4,532 Year Ended January 26, 2020: Revenue $ 7,639 $ 3,279 $ — $ 10,918 Operating income (loss) $ 3,267 $ 751 $ ( 1,172 ) $ 2,846 Year Ended January 27, 2019: Revenue $ 8,159 $ 3,557 $ — $ 11,716 Operating income (loss) $ 3,417 $ 1,251 $ ( 864 ) $ 3,804 Year Ended January 31, 2021 January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Reconciling items included in ""All Other"" category: Stock-based compensation expense $ ( 1,397 ) $ ( 844 ) $ ( 557 ) Acquisition-related intangible asset amortization ( 591 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) Unallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses ( 357 ) ( 283 ) ( 261 ) Acquisition-related inventory step-up charge ( 161 ) — — Acquisition-related and other costs ( 84 ) ( 25 ) 4 IP-related costs ( 38 ) ( 14 ) ( 35 ) Legal settlement costs — — ( 9 ) Total $ ( 2,628 ) $ ( 1,172 ) $ ( 864 ) Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location.

Our GeForce Experience gaming application further enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as GRID for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming. Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches, and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provided a full functionally safe AI-based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving. Leveraging our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through licenses and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology. Sales and Marketing Our sales strategy involves working with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient GPU and embedded system-on-a-chip, or SOC, platforms. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers in each industry. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, internet and cloud service providers, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.

We also employ a team of application engineers to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform. To encourage the development of applications optimized for our GPUs, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. 8 Table of Contents Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, Software Development Kits, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our GPU and CUDA platforms. We now have over 1.6 million registered developers across our platforms, including accelerated computing, gaming, deep learning, autonomous machines, and others. As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms and complete systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers. Sales to Dell Technologies Inc., or Dell, accounted for 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020. Backlog Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability. Our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules, thus, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonality Our GPU and Tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and cloud service provider data centers, although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks or game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue. Manufacturing We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix. We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutions. We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and ODMs such as Quanta Computer and Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key elements such as the GPU, SoC and memory are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process. 9 Table of Contents Working Capital We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platform-by-platform basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products. A substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 47% to $10.90 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 compared with the end of fiscal year 2019 . Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SOCs, and other accelerated and AI computing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. Our current competitors include: • suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, or Intel, and Xilinx, Inc.; • large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc.; and • suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, and Xilinx, Inc. or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors. Patents and Proprietary Rights We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2020 to October 2039. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as: • the location in which our products are manufactured; • our strategic technology or product directions in different countries; • the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and • the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions. We have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements. Employees As of January 26, 2020 , we had 13,775 employees, 9,823 of whom were engaged in research and development and 3,952 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions. 10 Table of Contents Environmental Regulatory Compliance To date, we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters.

RISK FACTORS In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted. We created GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed. Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue. Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or IP, portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results. System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation. Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or 12 Table of Contents implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses. Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business. We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including: • a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints; • a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products; • a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis; • a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers; • loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier; • a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and • delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise. In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available 13 Table of Contents software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed. For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any. If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share. Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their 14 Table of Contents interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. In January 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. The impact has extended to other regions. We have operations and employees in China, and the region represents an important end market for our products. Our customers and suppliers within China and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures. The coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business. If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed. We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. Such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell-through, as we experienced with our mid-range gaming GPUs in fiscal year 2019. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include: • changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy; • changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market; • a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products; • a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements; • our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products; • less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or • increased competition, including competitive pricing actions. The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. For fiscal year 2020, 11% of our total revenue was from one customer, Dell. Our operating results in the foreseeable 15 Table of Contents future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because: • most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty; • our partners may develop their own solutions; • our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or • our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products. We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade restrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient. We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business. We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 92% of total revenue for fiscal year 2020 , and 87% for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 . Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 25% of our revenue for fiscal year 2020, even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Additionally, as of January 26, 2020 , approximately 46% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including: • international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union, and other political tensions between countries in which we do business; • unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws; • differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices; • local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations; • exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; • disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and • increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits. If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful 16 Table of Contents in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments, including the Mellanox acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. In March 2019, we announced our agreement to acquire Mellanox for approximately $6.9 billion. The Mellanox acquisition and other past or future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to: • difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business; • diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; • assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets; • integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles; • coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated; • difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all; • difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing; • failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment; • legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; • uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; • negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate; • the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations; • potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and • impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment. Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from 17 Table of Contents a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results. Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to: • our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products; • our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services; • fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies; • changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products; • our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing; • our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations; • product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; • our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards; • supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products • inventory write-downs; • our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors; • the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers; • customer bad debt write-offs; • any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; • unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property; • changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and • general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets. Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility. 18 Table of Contents Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims. Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires companies to meet new requirements effective as of May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity. We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. For example, multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. In addition, a stockholder, purporting to act on behalf of the Company, filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the Company against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. 19 Table of Contents In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations. Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following: • the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval; • the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; • advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; • the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval; • a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; • the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and • the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws. On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. 20 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 14, 2020 , we had approximately 301 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through January 26, 2020 . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 26, 2020 , we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox. Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2020 , we withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $551 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans. 21 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graphs The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq 100 Index for the five years ended January 26, 2020 .

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, “Item 6. Selected Financial Data”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for VR, HPC, and AI. Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying graphics architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Fiscal Year 2020 Summary Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 Change ($ in millions, except per share data) Revenue $ 10,918 $ 11,716 Down 7% Gross margin 62.0 % 61.2 % Up 80 bps Operating expenses $ 3,922 $ 3,367 Up 16% Income from operations $ 2,846 $ 3,804 Down 25% Net income $ 2,796 $ 4,141 Down 32% Net income per diluted share $ 4.52 $ 6.63 Down 32% Revenue for fiscal year 2020 was $10.92 billion, down 7% from a year earlier. GPU business revenue was $9.47 billion, down 7% from a year earlier. Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes Automotive, SoCs for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $1.45 billion, down 6% from a year earlier. From a market platform perspective, Gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from a year ago, reflecting lower sales of GeForce desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs. Professional Visualization revenue was $1.21 billion, up 7% from a year ago, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations. Data Center revenue was $2.98 billion, up 2% from a year ago, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales. Automotive revenue was $700 million, up 9% from a year ago, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements. 24 Table of Contents OEM and Other revenue was $505 million, down 34% from a year ago, primarily due to the absence of cryptocurrency-specific product sales. Gross margin for fiscal year 2020 was 62.0%, up 80 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $3.92 billion, up 16% from a year ago, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation and infrastructure costs. Income from operations for fiscal year 2020 was $2.85 billion, down 25% from a year earlier. Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2020 were $2.80 billion and $4.52, respectively, both down 32% from a year earlier reflecting lower revenue and higher operating expenses. On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commission in December 2019. In addition, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in May 2019. Discussions with China's regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million . In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $10.90 billion as of January 26, 2020 , compared with $7.42 billion as of January 27, 2019 . The increase primarily reflects growth in operating cash flow. In January 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. The impact has extended to other regions. We have operations and employees in China, and the region represents an important end market for our products. Our customers and suppliers within China and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures. The coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have a material negative impact on our business. GPU Business In Gaming, we extended NVIDIA’s family of Turing-based GPUs with the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1660 and GTX 1650, as well as with our new SUPER line, including the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, RTX 2070 SUPER, RTX 2060 SUPER, GTX 1660 SUPER, and GTX 1650 SUPER; and accelerated momentum of ray-tracing games by supporting a growing list of titles; introduced new RTX Studio laptops powered by GeForce RTX and Quadro RTX GPUs for online and studio-based creatives and prosumer customers; unveiled two new models of the SHIELD TV streaming media player; and introduced two new service offerings for GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Professional Visualization, we expanded adoption of NVIDIA RTX ray-tracing technology by 3D application providers; rolled out a full range of Turing-based Quadro GPUs for mobile workstations, incorporating ray tracing for product design, architecture, effects and scientific visualization; and unveiled the NVIDIA Omniverse open-collaboration platform to simplify creative workflows for content creation. In Data Center, we introduced the NVIDIA CUDA-X AI platform for accelerating data science; announced availability of NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs from leading OEMs and cloud service providers; unveiled the DGX SuperPOD; and announced support for Arm CPUs, providing a new path to build AI-enabled exascale supercomputers, as well as a collaboration with Arm and others on a reference design for GPU accelerated Arm-based servers. We launched the NVIDIA EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform, bringing accelerated AI to vertical industries; and announced a collaboration to integrate Microsoft 25 Table of Contents Azure with EGX, as well as plans for a scalable GPU-accelerated supercomputer in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Additionally, we entered the 5G telecom market, enabling telcos to build efficient, virtualized 5G RANs; announced a collaboration to deliver software-defined 5G RAN; and announced that Alibaba and Baidu’s recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI. Tegra Processor Business In our Automotive platform, we announced a partnership with Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development to develop, train and validate self-driving vehicles; unveiled the NVIDIA DRIVE AP2X automated driving solution, encompassing DRIVE AutoPilot software, DRIVE AGX and DRIVE validation tools; introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE AV Safety Force Field to enable safe, comfortable driving experiences; and announced availability of the NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation autonomous vehicle simulation platform. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and m arket conditions. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019 . The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM, other components, and prior architecture components and chips. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products. Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. 26 Table of Contents Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 26, 2020 , we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units, 27 Table of Contents GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 26, 2020 was $210 million and $408 million , respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 38.0 38.8 Gross profit 62.0 61.2 Operating expenses: Research and development 25.9 20.3 Sales, general and administrative 10.0 8.5 Total operating expenses 35.9 28.7 Income from operations 26.1 32.5 Interest income 1.6 1.2 Interest expense (0.5 ) (0.5 ) Other, net — 0.1 Total other income 1.1 0.8 Income before income tax expense 27.2 33.3 Income tax expense (benefit) 1.6 (2.1 ) Net income 25.6 % 35.3 % Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) GPU $ 9,465 $ 10,175 $ (710 ) (7 )% Tegra Processor 1,453 1,541 (88 ) (6 )% Total $ 10,918 $ 11,716 $ (798 ) (7 )% GPU Business. GPU business revenue decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 , which reflects a decline in GPUs sold for gaming. GeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased by 10%, reflecting lower sales of GeForce 28 Table of Contents desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations. Data Center revenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lower hyperscale sales. Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 . This was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increase of 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , respectively . Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019 . Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year 2019. Operating Expenses Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 2,829 $ 2,376 $ 453 19 % % of net revenue 25.9 % 20.3 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 1,093 991 102 10 % % of net revenue 10.0 % 8.5 % Total operating expenses $ 3,922 $ 3,367 $ 555 16 % Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 , driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. 29 Table of Contents Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 , driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. Total Other Income, Net Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $178 million and $ 136 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016. Interest expense was $52 million and $58 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Other, Net Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was not significant during fiscal year 2020 and was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $174 million for fiscal year 2020 and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9% and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,896 $ 782 Marketable securities 1 6,640 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 10,897 $ 7,422 Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,761 $ 3,743 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 6,145 $ (4,097 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (792 ) $ (2,866 ) As of January 26, 2020 , we had $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $3.48 billion from the end of fiscal year 2019 . Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration. 30 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to changes in working capital driven by a reduction in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in operating income. Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower purchases, higher sales, and lower maturities of marketable securities in preparation for the acquisition of Mellanox. Cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to no share repurchases in fiscal year 2020 and lower tax payments related to employee stock plans. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 26, 2020 , we had $ 10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including our proposed acquisition of Mellanox. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the United States government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, asset-backed issuers, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. During fiscal year 2021, we expect our capital investment to be approximately $700 million to $900 million to fund property and equipment including construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus. As a result of the TCJA, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the United States as of January 26, 2020 are available for use in the United States without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Capital Return to Shareholders In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we returned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend to return to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox. As of January 26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities We have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, collectively, the Notes. We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 26, 2020 , we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement. We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 26, 2020 , we had not issued any commercial paper. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 26, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable SEC regulations. 31 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 26, 2020 : Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years (In millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,248 $ 54 $ 1,078 $ 64 $ 1,052 Inventory purchase obligations 1,156 1,156 — — — Transition tax payable (2) 351 33 67 146 105 Operating leases (3) 773 121 219 141 292 Capital purchase obligations 186 186 — — — Total contractual obligations $ 4,714 $ 1,550 $ 1,364 $ 351 $ 1,449 (1) Represents the aggregate principal amount of $2.00 billion and anticipated interest payments of $248 million for the Notes.

(2) Represents our remaining tax payable of the one-time transition tax that resulted from enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018. As of January 26, 2020, we have paid the first two installments totaling $67 million. The remaining will be payable in six annual installments. The next installment of $33 million is classified as a current income tax payable. The installment amounts are equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025 and 25% in fiscal year 2026. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (3) For further information, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of $211 million which consists of $180 million and the related interest and penalties of $31 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 26, 2020. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of January 26, 2020 , we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $1 million. In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2020 and 2019. Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their 32 Table of Contents prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The information required by this Item is set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of January 26, 2020 , our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 26, 2020 . The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are 33 Table of Contents met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal year 2020. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 37 Table of Contents and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Management applies significant judgment in the valuation of inventories, which involves estimating future demand and market conditions. As of January 26, 2020, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $979 million. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing their provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures over the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, which included evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past

of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 will be a 53-week year. Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. 45 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Advertising Expenses We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 were $ 15 million , $ 21 million , and $ 25 million , respectively. Product Warranties We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Stock-based Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency 46 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 26, 2020 , we had a valuation allowance of $ 621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable Securities Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an 47 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019 . Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, was approximately 21 % of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 26, 2020 and 19 % of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 27, 2019 . We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years . Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years . Depreciation expense includes the amortization 48 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Leases We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities. Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Refer to Note 6 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer relationships. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases under which lease assets and liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet. We adopted this guidance on January 49 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 28, 2019 using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We plan to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. We do not currently believe it will have a material impact upon adoption. Note 2 - Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $ 125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $ 6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commission in December 2019. In addition, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in May 2019. Discussions with China's regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $ 350 million . Note 3 - New Lease Accounting Standard Method and Impact of Adoption On January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet and not adjusting comparative information for prior periods. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. The cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $ 470 million of operating lease assets and $ 500 million of operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The difference of $ 30 million represents deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was an offset to the opening balance of operating lease assets. Lease Obligations Our lease obligations consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2021 and 2035 . 50 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of January 26, 2020 , are as follows: Operating Lease Obligations (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2021 $ 121 2022 117 2023 102 2024 79 2025 62 2026 and thereafter 292 Total 773 Less imputed interest 121 Present value of net future minimum lease payments 652 Less short-term operating lease liabilities 91 Long-term operating lease liabilities $ 561 Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 27, 2019, based on the previous lease accounting standard, are as follows: Lease Obligations (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2020 $ 100 2021 97 2022 90 2023 77 2024 54 2025 and thereafter 265 Total $ 683 Operating lease expense for fiscal years 2020 , 2019, and 2018 was $ 114 million , $ 80 million , $ 54 million , respectively.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. Equity Incentive Program We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 230 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 26, 2020 , there were 29 million shares available for future issuance. Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vested over a four -year period, subject to continued service, with 25 % vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25 % vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four -year period, subject to continued service, with 25 % vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grants made prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5 % vesting semi-annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016, 6.25 % vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100 % on approximately the three -year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria. Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment. 53 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Up to 89 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 26, 2020 , we had issued 30 million shares and reserved 59 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan. The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months , which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months . Employees or those employed by an affiliate of ours are eligible to participate as designated by the Board. Employees who participate may have up to 10 % of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15 % . The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85 % of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In millions, except years and per share data) Balances, January 27, 2019 16 $ 129.92 Granted (1)(2) 7 $ 184.47 Vested restricted stock ( 8 ) $ 92.70 Canceled and forfeited ( 1 ) $ 185.46 Balances, January 26, 2020 14 $ 176.72 Vested and expected to vest after January 26, 2020 11 $ 176.46 (1) Includes the number of PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest based on the corporate financial performance level achieved for fiscal year 2020 . (2) Includes the number of market-based PSUs granted that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum goal for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3 -year measurement period is achieved.

These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019 . We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019 : January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Designated as cash flow hedges $ 428 $ 408 Not designated for hedge accounting $ 287 $ 241 As of January 26, 2020 , all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months .

During fiscal years 2020 and 2019 , the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness. Note 12 - Debt Long-Term Debt 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 In fiscal year 2017, we issued $ 1.00 billion of the 2.20 % Notes Due 2021, and $ 1.00 billion of the 3.20 % Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $ 1.98 billion , after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes. 60 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows: Expected Remaining Term (years) Effective Interest Rate January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) 2.20% Notes Due 2021 1.6 2.38 % $ 1,000 $ 1,000 3.20% Notes Due 2026 6.6 3.31 % 1,000 1,000 Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs ( 9 ) ( 12 ) Net carrying amount $ 1,991 $ 1,988 Revolving Credit Facility We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $ 575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $ 425 million .

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. Litigation Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669), naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s officers. On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar purported securities class action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief. On February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective counsel to be appointed lead counsel. On March 12, 2019, the two cases were consolidated under case number 4:18-cv-07669-HSG and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. On May 2, 2019, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On June 21, 2019, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint. The consolidated complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. The plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On August 2, 2019, NVIDIA moved 61 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the named defendants. On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern District of California, captioned Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of NVIDIA against the members of NVIDIA’s board of directors and certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. On February 12, 2019, a substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766), naming the same named defendants, and seeking the same relief. On February 19, 2019, a third substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The Booth Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking substantially the same relief. On March 12, 2019, the three derivative actions were consolidated under case number 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation. The parties stipulated to stay the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation pending resolution of any motion to dismiss that NVIDIA may file in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. On September 24, 2019, two shareholders, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed two identical lawsuits in the District of Delaware. One is captioned Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and the other is captioned Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA). The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures. On December 11, 2019, the court approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the Lipchitz and Huang actions pending resolution of the motion to dismiss filed by NVIDIA in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants. Accounting for Loss Contingencies We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. As of January 26, 2020, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 62 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 14 - Income Taxes The income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Current income taxes: Federal $ 65 $ 1 $ 464 State 4 — 1 Foreign 87 69 43 Total current 156 70 508 Deferred taxes: Federal 2 ( 315 ) ( 376 ) State — — — Foreign 16 — 17 Total deferred 18 ( 315 ) ( 359 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 174 $ ( 245 ) $ 149 Income before income tax consists of the following: Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Domestic $ 620 $ 1,843 $ 1,600 Foreign 2,350 2,053 1,596 Income before income tax $ 2,970 $ 3,896 $ 3,196 The income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% , 21% , and 33.9% for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, to income before income taxes as follows: Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Tax expense computed at federal statutory rate $ 624 $ 818 $ 1,084 Expense (benefit) resulting from: State income taxes, net of federal tax effect 12 23 10 Foreign tax rate differential ( 301 ) ( 412 ) ( 545 ) Stock-based compensation ( 60 ) ( 191 ) ( 181 ) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — ( 368 ) ( 133 ) U.S. federal R&D tax credit ( 110 ) ( 141 ) ( 87 ) Other 9 26 1 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 174 $ ( 245 ) $ 149 63 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below: January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 62 $ 70 Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes 39 41 Property, equipment and intangible assets 12 2 Operating lease liabilities 114 — Research and other tax credit carryforwards 605 626 Stock-based compensation 28 25 GILTI deferred tax assets 428 376 Gross deferred tax assets 1,288 1,140 Less valuation allowance ( 621 ) ( 562 ) Total deferred tax assets 667 578 Deferred tax liabilities: Acquired intangibles ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 40 ) ( 35 ) Operating lease assets ( 107 ) — Gross deferred tax liabilities ( 148 ) ( 37 ) Net deferred tax asset (1) $ 519 $ 541 (1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $ 548 million and $ 560 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $ 29 million and $ 19 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets are included in Other assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized an income tax expense of $ 174 million and $ 149 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2018, respectively, and income tax benefit of $ 245 million for fiscal year 2019 . Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9 % , ( 6.3 )% , and 4.7 % for fiscal years 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 , respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higher U.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. As of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $ 621 million and $ 562 million , respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. 64 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of January 26, 2020, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 70 million , $ 153 million and $ 295 million , respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023 and 2021, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 295 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 26, 2020, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $ 314 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2039. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $ 814 million , of which $ 774 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $ 40 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2021. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization. As of January 26, 2020, we had $ 583 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $ 464 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $ 104 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $ 464 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 26, 2020 consisted of $ 180 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $ 284 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets. A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 477 $ 447 $ 224 Increases in tax positions for prior years 7 52 7 Decreases in tax positions for prior years — ( 141 ) ( 1 ) Increases in tax positions for current year 104 129 222 Lapse in statute of limitations ( 5 ) ( 10 ) ( 5 ) Balance at end of period $ 583 $ 477 $ 447 We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 26, 2020, January 27, 2019, and January 28, 2018, we had accrued $ 31 million , $ 21 million , and $ 15 million , respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 26, 2020, unrecognized tax benefits of $ 180 million and the related interest and penalties of $ 31 million are included in non-current income taxes payable. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 26, 2020, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 26, 2020, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2019. As of January 26, 2020, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include India, China, and United Kingdom for fiscal years 2003 through 2019. 65 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity Capital Return Program Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Through January 26, 2020 , we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $ 7.08 billion . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 26, 2020 , we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $ 7.24 billion through December 2022. During fiscal year 2020 , we paid $ 390 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. Preferred Stock As of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019 , there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Common Stock We are authorized to issue up to 2.00 billion shares of our common stock at $ 0.001 per share par value. Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans We have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, participating employees may defer up to 80 % of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits and we match a portion of the employee contributions. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 was $ 44 million , $ 39 million , and $ 23 million , respectively. We also have defined contribution retirement plans outside of the United States to which we contributed $ 32 million , $ 31 million , and $ 25 million for fiscal years 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 , respectively. Note 17 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying graphics architecture. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue included in all other is Intel licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related and other costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record inter-segment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category. 66 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) GPU Tegra Processor All Other Consolidated (In millions) Year Ended January 26, 2020: Revenue $ 9,465 $ 1,453 $ — $ 10,918 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 322 $ 44 $ 15 $ 381 Operating income (loss) $ 3,806 $ 196 $ ( 1,156 ) $ 2,846 Year Ended January 27, 2019: Revenue $ 10,175 $ 1,541 $ — $ 11,716 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 197 $ 47 $ 18 $ 262 Operating income (loss) $ 4,443 $ 241 $ ( 880 ) $ 3,804 Year Ended January 28, 2018: Revenue $ 8,137 $ 1,534 $ 43 $ 9,714 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 123 $ 37 $ 39 $ 199 Operating income (loss) $ 3,507 $ 303 $ ( 600 ) $ 3,210 Year Ended January 26, 2020 January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Reconciling items included in ""All Other"" category: Unallocated revenue $ — $ — $ 43 Stock-based compensation expense ( 844 ) ( 557 ) ( 391 ) Unallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses ( 267 ) ( 277 ) ( 237 ) Acquisition-related and other costs ( 30 ) ( 2 ) ( 15 ) Legal settlement costs ( 15 ) ( 44 ) — Total $ ( 1,156 ) $ ( 880 ) $ ( 600 ) Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location.

BUSINESS Our Company Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the graphics processing unit, or GPU, to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence, or AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, or VR, high performance computing, or HPC, and AI. The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning continues to be adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and features that would have been impossible with traditional coding. NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and Compute Unified Device Architecture, or CUDA, as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers. Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $17 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual computing. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the performance of the most demanding applications in HPC in fields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs power the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software have proven to be well suited for deep learning and are now expanding into machine learning, powering the era of AI. As the laws of physics have begun to slow down Moore’s Law, we continue to deliver GPU performance improvements ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.

This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering, an emerging trend in professional design. Our DesignWorks software delivers this to designers and enables an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. It also allows an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models. Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise applications, including within medicine, architecture, product design, and retail. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life all deploy this technology, powered by our GPUs. Visual computing is vital to productivity in many environments, including design and manufacturing and digital content creation. Design and manufacturing includes computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video editing and post production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics. Our brand for this market is Quadro for workstations. Quadro GPUs enhance the productivity of designers by improving performance and adding functionality, such as photorealistic rendering, high color fidelity, and advanced scalable display capabilities.

Datacenter The NVIDIA accelerated computing platform addresses AI and HPC applications. The platform consists of our energy efficient GPUs, our CUDA programming language, specific libraries such as cuDNN and TensorRT, and innovations such as NVLink, which enables application scalability across multiple GPUs. In the field of AI, NVIDIA’s platform accelerates both deep learning and machine learning workloads. Deep learning is a computer science approach where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data in the form of images, sounds and text - in some instances better than humans. Machine learning is a related approach that leverages algorithms as well as data to learn how to make determinations or predictions, often used in data science. HPC, also referred to as scientific computing, uses numerical computational approaches to solve large and complex problems. For both AI and HPC applications, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform greatly increases the performance and power efficiency of high-performance computers and datacenters, as GPUs excel at parallel workloads. For example, an NVIDIA GPU-accelerated machine learning cluster for data science is 1/8 the cost, 1/15 the space, and 1/18 the power of a traditional CPU-based cluster. We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such as reading medical images, to enabling fraud detection in financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling. These organizations include the world’s leading cloud services companies such as Amazon, Baidu, and Facebook, which are infusing AI in applications that enable highly accurate voice recognition and real-time translation; enterprises that are increasingly turning to AI to improve products and services; and startups seeking to implement AI in transformative ways across multiple industries.

NVIDIA is working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tier-one suppliers, sensor manufacturers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep neural networks using our Tesla GPUs, and then running them within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE computing platform. The platform consists of high-performance, energy efficient hardware - DRIVE AGX, and open, modular software - including DRIVE AV for autonomous driving and DRIVE IX for in-vehicle AI assistance. In addition, we offer a scalable simulation solution, NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, for testing and validating a self-driving platform before commercial deployment. This end-to-end, software-defined approach allows cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle. NVIDIA DRIVE can perceive and understand in real-time what's happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on an HD map, and plan a safe path forward. This advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVE platform scales from a palm-sized, energy-efficient module for automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiple systems aimed at enabling driverless cars. Our Xavier SoC, which started shipping in 2018, enables vehicles to use deep neural networks to process data from multiple cameras and sensors. It powers the DRIVE AutoPilot, the first commercially available Level 2+ automated driving system, combining the DRIVE AV self-driving solution with the DRIVE IX cockpit software, including a visualization system for allowing the driver to see what the car sees and plans to do. Business Strategies NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include: Advancing the GPU computing platform. The massive parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs can solve complex problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, GPUs can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued GPU performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, and software layers. Our strategy is to target markets where GPUs deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches. Our target markets so far include gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in R&D: we can support several multi-billion dollar end markets with the same underlying technology 7 Table of Contents by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets. Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end GPU computing platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and system software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are over 1.2 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and more than 3,600 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform. Extending our technology and platform leadership in visual computing. We believe that visual computing is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources to extending our leadership in visual computing, enabling us to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications. Our technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to create near-cinematic and VR experiences. Our close collaboration with game developers allows us to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our GeForce Experience gaming application further enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as GRID for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming. Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches, and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we have provided a full functionally safe AI-based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving. Leveraging our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through licenses and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology. Sales and Marketing Our sales strategy involves working with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient GPU and embedded system-on-a-chip, or SOC, platforms. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers in each industry. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, internet and cloud service providers, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants. Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform. To encourage the development of applications optimized for our GPUs, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, Software Development Kits, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training 8 Table of Contents for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our GPU and CUDA platforms. We now have over 700 thousand registered developers across our platforms, including accelerated computing, gaming, deep learning, autonomous machines, and others. As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms and complete systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers. Backlog Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements and in manufacturing availability. Our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules, thus, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable portion is not significant. Seasonality Our GPU and Tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and cloud service provider datacenters, although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry. Our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue; for example, in fiscal year 2019 second half revenue was weaker than the first half. Manufacturing We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI Logistics Ltd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix. We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutions. We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and ODMs such as Quanta Computer and Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key elements such as the GPU, SOC and memory are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process. Working Capital We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platform-by-platform basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand. We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. A substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands. 9 Table of Contents Our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 4% to $7.42 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019 compared with the end of fiscal year 2018 . Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SOCs, and accelerated and AI computing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. Our current competitors include: • suppliers or licensors of discrete and integrated GPUs and accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC or accelerated computing functionality as part of their solutions or platforms, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, or Intel, and Xilinx, Inc.; and • suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, Texas Instruments Incorporated, and Xilinx Inc. Patents and Proprietary Rights We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2019 to February 2038. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as: • the location in which our products are manufactured; • our strategic technology or product directions in different countries; • the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and • the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions. We have also licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons, and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements. Employees As of January 27, 2019 , we had 13,277 employees, 9,486 of whom were engaged in research and development and 3,791 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions. Environmental Regulatory Compliance To date, we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters. 10 Table of Contents Executive Officers of the Registrant The following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of February 15, 2019 : Name Age Position Jen-Hsun Huang 55 President and Chief Executive Officer Colette M.

RISK FACTORS In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Partners If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted. We have created GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We currently devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and datacenter markets, which presents additional risks to our business. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas, including customer service and customer support. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed. Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue. Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or IP, portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results. System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation. Security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may 12 Table of Contents create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses. Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share. Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business. We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including: • a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints; • a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products; 13 Table of Contents • a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis; • loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier; • a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and • delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise. In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed. For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any. Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current datacenter capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, and Korea. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our operations 14 Table of Contents could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed. We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. Such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell-through, as we experienced with our mid-range gaming GPUs in fiscal year 2019. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include: • changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy; • changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market; • a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products; • a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements; • our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products; • less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or • increased competition, including competitive pricing actions. The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged. We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business. We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 87% of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 24% of our revenue for fiscal year 2019, even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Additionally, as of January 27, 2019 , approximately 46% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including: • international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union, and other political tensions between countries in which we do business; • unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws; • differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices; 15 Table of Contents • local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations; • exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; • disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and • increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits. If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. The risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to: • difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business; • diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention; • assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets; • difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all; • difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing; • failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment; • legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; • uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; • the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations; • potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and • impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment. 16 Table of Contents Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results. Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to: • our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products; • our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services; • fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies; • changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products; • our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing; • our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations; • product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; • our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards; • supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products • inventory write-downs; 17 Table of Contents • our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors; • the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers; • customer bad debt write-offs; • any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; • unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property; • changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and • general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets. Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility. Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims. Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity. We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income. 18 Table of Contents Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings. We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. For example, multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. In addition, a stockholder, purporting to act on behalf of the Company, filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the Company against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex, and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or remedy violations of, these regulations. Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following: • the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval; • the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; • advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; • the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval; • a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; • the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and • the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws. On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California. It includes ten leased commercial buildings totaling 981,389 square feet, and real property that we own totaling 1,257,346 square feet.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 15, 2019 , we had approximately 317 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through January 27, 2019 . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. In November 2018, the Board authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program and extended it through the end of December 2022. As of January 27, 2019 , we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion . We intend to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million of share repurchases we made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. 20 Table of Contents The following table presents details of our share repurchase transactions during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (In thousands) Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program (In thousands) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program (In billions) October 29, 2018 - November 25, 2018 123 $ 195.72 123 $ 7.94 November 26, 2018 - December 23, 2018 3,304 $ 142.05 3,304 $ 7.47 December 24, 2018 - January 27, 2019 1,777 $ 129.87 1,777 $ 7.24 Total 5,204 5,204 Transactions Related to our 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 and Note Hedges During fiscal year 2019 , we issued an aggregate of 714 thousand shares of our common stock upon settlement of $16 million in principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018, or the Convertible Notes, submitted for conversion. In connection with these conversions, we exercised a portion of our Note Hedges to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock. The counterparty to the Note Hedges may be deemed an “affiliated purchaser” and may have purchased the shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon this exercise of our option. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and the Note Hedges. Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2019 , we withheld approximately 4 million shares at a total cost of $1.03 billion through net share settlements. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans. 21 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graphs The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq 100 Index for the five years ended January 27, 2019 .

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, “Item 6. Selected Financial Data”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. 23 Table of Contents Overview Our Company and Our Businesses Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of VR, HPC, and AI. Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Fiscal Year 2019 Summary Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 Change ($ in millions, except per share data) Revenue $ 11,716 $ 9,714 Up 21% Gross margin 61.2 % 59.9 % Up 130 bps Operating expenses $ 3,367 $ 2,612 Up 29% Income from operations $ 3,804 $ 3,210 Up 19% Net income $ 4,141 $ 3,047 Up 36% Net income per diluted share $ 6.63 $ 4.82 Up 38% Revenue for fiscal year 2019 increased 21% year over year, reflecting growth in each of our market platforms - gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. GPU business revenue was $10.17 billion, up 25% from a year earlier. Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes automotive, SOC modules for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $1.54 billion, up slightly from a year ago. Gaming revenue was $6.25 billion, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in gaming GPUs. Gaming GPU growth was fueled by Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our Max-Q technology. We experienced significant volatility in our Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2019. We believe demand for our desktop gaming GPU products used by end users for cryptocurrency mining and its after-effects have distorted trends in Gaming revenue. We also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China have impacted consumer demand for our GeForce gaming GPU products. In addition, sales of certain high-end GeForce gaming GPUs using our new Turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. As a result, during a portion of fiscal year 2019, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory. For fiscal year 2020, we expect our Gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019, with expected growth from sales of Turing-based GPU products and notebook GPU products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previously-noted factors. Professional visualization revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% from a year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products. Datacenter revenue was $2.93 billion, up 52% from a year ago, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems. Toward the end of fiscal year 2019, we believe that customers across broad-based vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty, and a number of 24 Table of Contents Datacenter deals did not close. While we believe the pause is temporary, our visibility remains relatively low and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in the Datacenter market until later in fiscal year 2020. Automotive revenue of $641 million was up 15% from a year earlier, driven by infotainment modules, production DRIVE platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies. OEM and IP revenue was $767 million, down 1% from a year ago, driven by the absence of Intel licensing revenue, which concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $306 million and $273 million, respectively. We expect revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products to be negligible going forward. Gross margin for fiscal year 2019 was 61.2%, compared with 59.9% a year earlier, which reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips. Operating expenses for fiscal year 2019 were $3.37 billion, up 29% from a year earlier, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs. Income from operations for fiscal year 2019 was $3.80 billion, up 19% from a year earlier. Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2019 were $4.14 billion and $6.63, respectively, up 36% and 38%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled primarily by revenue growth and improved gross margin, as well as the impact of the U.S. tax reform benefit. During fiscal year 2019 , we returned $1.95 billion to shareholders through a combination of $1.58 billion in share repurchases and $371 million in quarterly cash dividends. We intend to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million of share repurchases we made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.42 billion as of January 27, 2019 , compared with $7.11 billion as of January 28, 2018 . The increase was primarily related to the increase in net income, partially offset by changes in working capital and the increases in stock repurchases, dividends and taxes paid related to restricted stock units. GPU Business During fiscal year 2019, for gaming, we announced NVIDIA RTX - a computer graphics technology using our Turing architecture that produces movie-quality images in real time using ray tracing and AI. During the year, we released many new GeForce RTX desktop gaming GPU products, including RTX 2080Ti, 2080, 2070 and 2060, as well as many new Max-Q GeForce gaming notebook GPU products - the most recent of which are powered by RTX GPUs. For our professional visualization platform, we announced the Quadro GV100 GPU with RTX technology, making real-time ray tracing possible on professional design and content creation applications. We also unveiled the Quadro RTX series, which is designed to revolutionize the workflow of designers and artists on the desktop, and announced the NVIDIA CUDA-accelerated REDCODE RAW decode SDK, enabling developers and studios to edit 8K video. For our datacenter platform, we unveiled many advances to our deep learning computing platform - including NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with 32GB memory, NVIDIA NVSwitch GPU interconnect fabric, the NVIDIA DGX-2 and HGX-2 for AI and HPC, the NVIDIA RTX Server, and TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software. In addition, we introduced RAPIDS, an open-source GPU-acceleration platform for data science and machine learning, launched the NVIDIA T4 cloud GPU and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Inference Platform for advanced acceleration in hyperscale datacenters, announced GPU acceleration for Kubernetes to facilitate enterprise inference deployment on multi-cloud GPU clusters, and announced that five of the world’s seven fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA GPUs. Tegra Processor Business During fiscal year 2019, for the automotive market, we introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE AutoPilot Level 2+ automated driving system, announced NVIDIA DRIVE AGX design wins with Toyota, Volvo Cars and Isuzu Motors, and announced that Daimler and Bosch have selected NVIDIA’s DRIVE platform to bring automated and driverless vehicles to city streets. We also began production of our Xavier single-chip autopilot SOC, started shipping the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier developer kit, and introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation server with DRIVE Sim software to safely test drive autonomous vehicles over billions of miles in virtual reality by leveraging NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA DRIVE Pegasus. In addition, we launched the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier module to help build the next-generation of autonomous machines and announced that Yamaha Motor Co. will use NVIDIA to power its upcoming lineup of autonomous machines. 25 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 26 Table of Contents Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and m arket conditions. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 . The higher amount of charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM, other components, and prior architecture components and chips, whereas the charges we took during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to the write-off of excess quantities of GPU and Tegra products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products. Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 27, 2019 , we had a valuation allowance of $562 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. The SEC had provided guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year 27 Table of Contents from the enactment date. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and elected to account for GILTI in deferred taxes. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information specific to accounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the TCJA. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units, GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 27, 2019 was $210 million and $408 million , respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 , we used the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit and concluded there was no impairment. Refe r to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased. We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. The fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments. We performed an impairment review of our debt investment portfolio as of January 27, 2019 . We concluded that our debt investments were appropriately valued and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale debt investments as of January 27, 2019 . Refe r to Notes 7 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Stock-based Compensation Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan. The number of PSUs and market-based PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the Company’s level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year. Re fer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations co uld be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.

GPU business revenue increased by 25% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 . This increase was due primarily to 18% growth in sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming, driven by initial sales of Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our Max-Q technology. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 52%, reflecting strong sales of our Volta architecture products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 21% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products. Our PC OEM revenue decreased by 1% driven by the absence of Intel licensing revenue in fiscal year 2019. Revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $306 million and $273 million, respectively. We expect cryptocurrency-related revenue to be negligible going forward. GPU business revenue increased by 40% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 led by growth in gaming, datacenter and professional visualization. Revenue from sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 20%, reflecting continued strong demand for our Pascal-based GPU products. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 133%, reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated GPU computing as well as demand for HPC, DGX AI supercomputing and GRID virtualization platforms. Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 12% due primarily to higher sales in both high-end desktop and mobile 29 Table of Contents workstation products. Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs increased by over 90% due primarily to strong demand for GPU products targeted for cryptocurrency mining. Tegra Processor Business. Tegra Processor business revenue was up slightly in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 . This was driven by an increase of over 15% in automotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies, offset by a decline of approximately 15% in SOC modules for gaming platforms and related development services. Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 86% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 . This was driven by an increase of over 300% in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms and development services, and an increase of 15% in automotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements for self-driving cars. All Other. Our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2018, we recognized related revenue of $ 43 million , down from $ 264 million for fiscal year 2017. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 87% of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based o n the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. In fiscal year 2017, we had one customer that represented 12% of our total revenue. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 61.2% , 59.9% , and 58.8% for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2019 reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue, and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Inventory provisions totaled $270 million, $48 million, and $62 million for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $41 million, $35 million, and $51 million for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 . A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018 , primarily due to strong sales of high-end GeForce gaming GPUs and revenue growth in Datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to strong sales of our GeForce gaming GPU products and revenue growth in datacenter, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, for cloud, deep learning, AI, and graphics virtualization. Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018 , primarily due to a favorable mix shift. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 , primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive. 30 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 $ Change % Change January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 2,376 $ 1,797 $ 579 32 % $ 1,797 $ 1,463 $ 334 23 % % of net revenue 20.3 % 18.5 % 18.5 % 21.2 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 991 815 176 22 % 815 663 152 23 % % of net revenue 8.5 % 8.4 % 8.4 % 9.6 % Restructuring and other charges — — — — % — 3 (3 ) (100 )% % of net revenue — % — % — % — % Total operating expenses $ 3,367 $ 2,612 $ 755 29 % $ 2,612 $ 2,129 $ 483 23 % Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 32% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 and increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 , driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. Sales, General and Administrative Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 22% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 and increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 , driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense. Total Other Income (Expense) Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $136 million , $69 million , and $54 million in fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher rates from our floating rate securities and the purchase of new securities. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $58 million , $61 million , and $58 million in fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Other, Net Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, losses on early debt conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments. Other, net, was $22 million and $25 million of expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisting primarily of $19 million and $21 million of losses recognized from early conversions of the Convertible Notes during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income Taxes The TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes (GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. 31 Table of Contents We recognized income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019, and income tax expense of $149 million and $239 million for fiscal years 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was (6.3)%, 4.7%, and 12.5% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higher U.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 and 35% for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. In fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the TCJA by applying the SEC guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects. Furthermore, under U.S. GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Because we were still evaluating the GILTI provisions as of January 28, 2018, we recorded no GILTI-related deferred balances. After further evaluation, we elected to account for GILTI deferred taxes. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and recognized a reduction of $368 million to the provisional amount recorded at January 28, 2018, primarily relating to the effects of electing to account for GILTI in deferred taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 782 $ 4,002 Marketable securities 6,640 3,106 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 7,422 $ 7,108 Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,743 $ 3,502 $ 1,672 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (4,097 ) $ 1,278 $ (793 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (2,866 ) $ (2,544 ) $ 291 As of January 27, 2019 , we had $7.42 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $314 million from the end of fiscal year 2018 . Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration. Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 , primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital. 32 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 , due to higher purchases and lower sales of marketable securities, partially offset by higher maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2018 increased from fiscal year 2017 , primarily due to a reduction in purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by the purchase of our previously-financed Santa Clara campus building. Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 , due to higher share repurchases and higher tax payments related to employee stock plans, partially offset by lower repayments of Convertible Notes. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2018 increased from fiscal year 2017 , primarily due to cash provided from the issuance of $2.00 billion of Notes in fiscal year 2017 as well as higher repayments of Convertible Notes, tax payments related to employee stock plans, share repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal year 2018. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 , we had $ 7.42 billion and $ 7.11 billion , respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, asset-backed issuers, mortgage-backed securities by government-sponsored enterprises, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A and Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. As a result of the TCJA, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the United States as of January 27, 2019 are available for use in the United States without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Capital Return to Shareholders We previously announced our plan to return $1.25 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2019 and an additional $3.00 billion by the end of fiscal year 2020 - some of which would begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. During fiscal year 2019 , we repurchased a total of 9 million shares for $1.58 billion , including $700 million of the $3.00 billion, and paid $371 million in cash dividends. We intend to return the remaining $2.30 billion of the $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020 through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. In November 2018, the Board authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program and extended it through the end of December 2022. As of January 27, 2019 , we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion . In November 2018, we also announced a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share from $0.15 per share. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Notes Due 2021 and Notes Due 2026 In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026, collectively, the Notes. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs. Revolving Credit Facility We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 27, 2019 , we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement. Commercial Paper We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 27, 2019 , we had not issued any commercial paper. 33 Table of Contents Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements In fiscal year 2019, we began construction on a 750 thousand square foot building on our Santa Clara campus, which is currently targeted for completion in fiscal year 2022. We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 27, 2019, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable SEC regulations. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 27, 2019 : Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years All Other (In millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,302 $ 54 $ 1,100 $ 64 $ 1,084 $ — Inventory purchase obligations 912 912 — — — — Transition tax payable (2) 384 33 67 96 188 — Uncertain tax positions, interest and penalties (3) 163 — — — — 163 Operating leases 683 100 187 131 265 — Capital purchase obligations 258 192 66 — — — Total contractual obligations $ 4,702 $ 1,291 $ 1,420 $ 291 $ 1,537 $ 163 (1) Represents the aggregate principal amount of $2.00 billion and anticipated interest payments of $302 million for the Notes. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Represents our remaining tax payable of the one-time transition tax that resulted from enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018. As of January 27, 2019, we have paid the first installment of $33 million. The remaining will be payable in seven annual installments. The next installment of $33 million is classified as a current income tax payable. The installment amounts are equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal year 2024, 20% in fiscal year 2025 and 25% in fiscal year 2026. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information about the one-time transition tax. (3) Represents unrecognized tax benefits of $163 million which consists of $142 million and the related interest and penalties of $21 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 27, 2019. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses. As of January 27, 2019 , we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $8 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $7 million , respectively. In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 34 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017. Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of January 27, 2019 , our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 27, 2019 . The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein. 35 Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 27, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 27, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 39 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California February 21, 2019 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004. 40 Table of Contents NVIDIA

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 52-week years. Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers. For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. 47 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Advertising Expenses We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 were $ 21 million , $25 million , and $17 million , respectively. Product Warranties We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Stock-based Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency 48 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant. Income Taxes We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of January 27, 2019 , we had a valuation allowance of $562 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly changes U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, had provided guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year from the enactment date. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and elected to account for GILTI in deferred taxes. Refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Additionally, we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that required us, upon conversion, to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock. Our Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and related Warrants contained various conversion features, which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the Convertible Notes and Warrants under the treasury stock method were included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion was dilutive. However, the Note Hedges were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share unless actually exercised, as their pre-exercised effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. 49 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable Securities Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have other indicators of impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 . Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, aggregated approximately 19% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 27, 2019 and 28% of our account receivable balance from two customers as of January 28, 2018 . We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. 50 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Refer to Note 5 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer relationships. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the 51 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries. We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. We are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity investments through net income rather than other comprehensive income. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted The FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases under which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months. We will adopt this guidance using the optional transition method at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 and will not restate comparative prior periods. Additionally, we will elect the package of practical expedients as permitted by the guidance. We are in the process of finalizing changes to our systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements and currently expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $500 million . In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. The standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 2 - New Revenue Accounting Standard Method and Impact of Adoption On January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a $7 million increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax. Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted. The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019 was not significant. Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations Deferred revenue is comprised mainly of customer advances and deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS related to software licensing. The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during fiscal year 2019: 52 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) January 27, 2019 (in millions) Balance as of January 28, 2018 $ 68 Adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of new revenue standard (5 ) Balance as of January 29, 2018 63 Deferred revenue added during the period 344 Revenue recognized during the period (269 ) Balance as of January 27, 2019 $ 138 Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. As of January 27, 2019, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $305 million , of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Refer to Note 16 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including disaggregated revenue disclosures. Note 3 - Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our ESPP. Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows: Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions) Cost of revenue $ 27 $ 21 $ 15 Research and development 336 219 134 Sales, general and administrative 194 151 98 Total $ 557 $ 391 $ 247 Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventories was not significant during fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . The following is a summary of equity awards granted under our equity incentive plans: Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions, except per share data) RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Awards granted 4 6 12 Estimated total grant-date fair value $ 1,109 $ 929 $ 591 Weighted average grant-date fair value (per share) $ 258.26 $ 145.91 $ 50.57 ESPP Shares purchased 1 5 4 Weighted average price (per share) $ 107.48 $ 21.24 $ 18.51 Weighted average grant-date fair value (per share) $ 38.51 $ 7.12 $ 5.80 53 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Beginning fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Company’s level of achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year. Of the total fair value of equity awards, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest for fiscal year 2019 was $88 million . January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense $ 1,580 $ 1,091 Estimated weighted average remaining amortization period (In years) RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs 2.2 2.3 ESPP 0.8 0.7 The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions: Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (Using the Black-Scholes model) ESPP Weighted average expected life (in years) 0.1-2.0 0.5-2.0 0.5-2.0 Risk-free interest rate 1.6%-2.8% 0.8%-1.4% 0.5%-0.9% Volatility 24%-75% 40%-54% 30%-39% Dividend yield 0.3%-0.4% 0.3%-0.5% 0.7%-1.4% For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. Equity Incentive Program We grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 230 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 27, 2019 , there were 35 million shares available for future issuance. 54 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vest over a four -year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four -year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grants made prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5% vesting semi-annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016, 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three -year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria. Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment. Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Up to 89 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 27, 2019 , we had issued 29 million shares and reserved 60 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan. The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months. Employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board. Employees who participate in an offering may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld up to certain limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion, up to 15% . The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. Employees may end their participation in the 2012 Plan at any time during the offering period, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with us. In each case, the employee’s contributions are refunded. The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In millions, except years and per share data) Balances, January 28, 2018 22 $ 66.72 Granted (1)(2) 4 $ 258.26 Vested restricted stock (10 ) $ 52.56 Canceled and forfeited — $ — Balances, January 27, 2019 16 $ 129.92 Vested and expected to vest after January 27, 2019 13 $ 129.44 (1) Includes PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest based on the corporate financial performance level achieved for fiscal year 2019 . (2) Includes market-based PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum target for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3 -year measurement period is achieved. Depending on the ranking of our TSR compared to the respective TSRs of the companies comprising the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during that period, the market-based PSUs issued could be up to 45 thousand shares. As of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 , there were 35 million and 16 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. 55 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $180 million , $318 million , and $246 million for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Upon exercise of an option, we issue new shares of stock. Note 4 - Net Income Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions, except per share data) Numerator: Net income $ 4,141 $ 3,047 $ 1,666 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares 608 599 541 Dilutive impact of outstanding securities: Equity awards 17 24 26 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes — 5 44 Warrants issued with the 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes — 4 38 Diluted weighted average shares 625 632 649 Net income per share: Basic (1) $ 6.81 $ 5.09 $ 3.08 Diluted (2) $ 6.63 $ 4.82 $ 2.57 Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive 5 4 8 (1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares. (2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares. The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018, or the Convertible Notes, were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes had a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeded the adjusted conversion price of $20.02 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding were also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. As of January 27, 2019 , there were no Convertible Notes or Warrants outstanding. Refer to Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants. Note 5 - Goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill was $618 million , and the amount of goodwill allocated to our GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units was $210 million and $408 million , respectively, as of both January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 . There were no changes to the carrying amount of goodwill during fiscal years 2019 and 2018. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was no t impaired in any of these years. 56 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6 - Amortizable Intangible Assets The components of our amortizable intangible assets are as follows: January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount (In millions) (In millions) Acquisition-related intangible assets $ 195 $ (188 ) $ 7 $ 195 $ (180 ) $ 15 Patents and licensed technology 491 (453 ) 38 469 (432 ) 37 Total intangible assets $ 686 $ (641 ) $ 45 $ 664 $ (612 ) $ 52 The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is due to purchases of licensed technology during fiscal year 2019. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $29 million , $55 million , and $68 million , respectively. Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of January 27, 2019 is estimated to be $21 million in fiscal year 2020 , $12 million in fiscal year 2021 , $5 million in fiscal year 2022 , and $5 million in fiscal year 2023 , and $2 million in fiscal year 2024.

(B) Leasehold improvements and capital leases are amortized based on the lesser of either the asset’s estimated useful life or the remaining expected lease term. (C) Construction in process represents assets that are not available for their intended use as of the balance sheet date. Depreciation expense for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $233 million , $144 million , and $118 million , respectively. Accumulated amortization of leasehold improvements and capital leases was $189 million and $178 million as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 , respectively.

(2) Deferred revenue primarily includes deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS. Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 . We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 : January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Designated as cash flow hedges $ 408 $ 104 Not designated for hedge accounting $ 241 $ 94 As of January 27, 2019 , all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018 , the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness. Note 11 - Debt Long-Term Debt 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption 61 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion , after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes. The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows: Expected Remaining Term (years) Effective Interest Rate January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) 2.20% Notes Due 2021 2.6 2.38% $ 1,000 $ 1,000 3.20% Notes Due 2026 7.6 3.31% 1,000 1,000 Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs (12 ) (15 ) Net carrying amount $ 1,988 $ 1,985 Convertible Debt 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of Convertible Notes. During fiscal year 2019 , we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $16 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and issued 714 thousand shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value. The related loss on early conversions was not significant. As of January 27, 2019 , there were no Convertible Notes outstanding. Note Hedges Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges. Through January 27, 2019 , we had received 57 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.50 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes. As of January 27, 2019 , there were no Note Hedges outstanding. Revolving Credit Facility We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million . As of January 27, 2019 , we had no t borrowed any amounts under this agreement. Commercial Paper We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 27, 2019 , we had no t issued any commercial paper. Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies Inventory Purchase Obligations As of January 27, 2019 , we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $912 million . Capital Purchase Obligations As of January 27, 2019 , we had outstanding capital purchase obligations totaling $258 million . 62 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Lease Obligations Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara, California and includes ten buildings that are leased properties. Future minimum lease payments related to headquarters operating leases total $326 million over the remaining terms of the leases, including predetermined rent escalations, and are included in the future minimum lease payment schedule below. Additionally, we have other domestic and international office facilities, including datacenter space, under operating leases expiring through fiscal year 2035. Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 27, 2019 , are as follows: Future Minimum Lease Obligations (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2020 $ 100 2021 97 2022 90 2023 77 2024 54 2025 and thereafter 265 Total $ 683 Rent expense for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $80 million , $54 million , and $46 million , respectively. Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities The estimated amount of product returns and warranty liabilities was $18 million and $15 million as of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 , respectively. In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. Litigation Polaris Innovations Limited On May 16, 2016, Polaris Innovations Limited, or Polaris, a non-practicing entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.), filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe six U.S. patents relating to the control of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against NVIDIA. On September 14, 2016, NVIDIA answered the Polaris Complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the six Polaris patents. On December 5, 2016, the Texas Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to transfer and ordered the case transferred to the Northern District of California. Between December 7, 2016 and July 25, 2017, NVIDIA filed multiple petitions for inter partes review, or IPR, at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the U.S. litigation. The USPTO instituted IPRs for four U.S. patents and declined to institute IPRs on two U.S. patents. On June 19, 2018, the USPTO issued a Final Written Decision on one IPR, finding claims 1-23 and 28 unpatentable but that claims 24-27 were not proved unpatentable. On November 20, 2018, the USPTO issued Final Written Decisions on two IPRs, finding claims 1, 4, 8-12, 16, 18, 43, 45, and 48-51 unpatentable but that claims 2-3, 5, 14, 17, 19-23, 26-31, and 44 were not proved unpatentable. On December 4, 2018, the USPTO issued a Final Written Decision on one IPR, finding all claims unpatentable. On December 19, 2018, the USPTO issued a Final Written Decision on one IPR, finding claims 1-14 unpatentable. 63 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) On June 15, 2017, the California Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the district court litigation pending resolution of the petitions for IPR. The California Court has not set a trial date. On December 30, 2016, Polaris filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf, Germany. Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe three patents relating to control of DRAM. On July 14, 2017, NVIDIA filed defenses to the infringement allegations including non-infringement with respect to each of the three asserted patents. On September 3, 2018, NVIDIA filed a rejoinder with additional noninfringement arguments. On December 4, 2018, NVIDIA filed a further rejoinder with additional noninfringement, nullity, and FRAND arguments. An oral hearing is scheduled for February 21, 2019. Between March 31, 2017 and June 12, 2017, NVIDIA filed nullity actions with the German Patent Court challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the German litigation. ZiiLabs 1 Patents Lawsuit On October 2, 2017, ZiiLabs Inc., Ltd., or ZiiLabs, a non-practicing entity, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe four U.S. patents relating to GPUs, or the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. ZiiLabs is a Bermuda corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Asia Limited, a Hong Kong company which is itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Ltd., a publicly traded Singapore company. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or indirect infringement of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. On November 27, 2017, NVIDIA answered the ZiiLabs complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. On January 10, 2018, ZiiLabs filed a first amended complaint asserting infringement of a fifth U.S. patent. On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the ZiiLabs 1 case pending the resolution of the U.S. International Trade Commission, or USITC, investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents. On February 1, 2019, NVIDIA entered into an immaterial agreement in which it receives a license to the ZiiLabs patents and a dismissal of the ZiiLabs 1 and 2 Patent Lawsuits. The ZiiLabs 1 and 2 district court cases were dismissed pursuant to a stipulation of dismissal filed on February 8, 2019. The Administrative Law Judge issued an Initial Determination on February 12, 2019, granting the motion to terminate the USITC investigation addressing the ZiiLabs 2 patents. ZiiLabs 2 Patents Lawsuits On December 27, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a second complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed four additional U.S. patents, or the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. The second complaint also seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or indirect infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the district court action on the ZiiLabs 2 patents pending the resolution of the USITC Investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents. On December 29, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a request with the USITC to commence an Investigation pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the unlawful importation of certain graphics processors and products containing the same. ZiiLabs alleges that the unlawful importation results from the infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents by products from respondents NVIDIA, ASUSTeK Computer Inc., ASUS Computer International, EVGA Corporation, Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd., G.B.T. Inc., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., MSI Computer Corp., Nintendo Co., Ltd., Nintendo of America Inc., PNY Technologies Inc., Zotac International (MCO) Ltd., and Zotac USA Inc. On February 28, 2018, NVIDIA and the other respondents answered the USITC complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the four asserted ZiiLabs 2 patents. On May 10, 2018, the Administrative Law Judge then presiding over the investigation issued an Initial Determination terminating the investigation with respect to one of the patents. On July 17, 2018, the USITC affirmed this decision on modified grounds. 64 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) On October 18, 2018, the Administrative Law Judge currently presiding over the investigation issued an order construing certain claims of the three remaining patents in the investigation. The hearing in the investigation is currently scheduled to begin on April 8, 2019. The target date for completion of the investigation is September 9, 2019. On February 1, 2019, NVIDIA entered into an immaterial agreement in which it receives a license to the ZiiLabs patents and a dismissal of the ZiiLabs 1 and 2 Patent Lawsuits. The ZiiLabs 1 and 2 district court cases were dismissed pursuant to a stipulation of dismissal filed on February 8, 2019. The Administrative Law Judge issued an Initial Determination on February 12, 2019, granting the motion to terminate the USITC investigation addressing the ZiiLabs 2 patents. Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669), naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s officers. The complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between August 10, 2017 and November 15, 2018. The plaintiff also alleges that the NVIDIA officers who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of equitable/injunctive or other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar purported securities class action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief. The two cases have been related and are before the same judge. A stipulation to consolidate the Iron Workers and Oto actions is pending before the Court. On February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective counsel to be appointed lead counsel. On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on the behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern District of California, captioned Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of NVIDIA against the members of NVIDIA’s board of directors and certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. On February 12, 2019, a substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766), naming the same named defendants, and seeking the same relief. On February 19, 2019, a third substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The Booth Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking substantially the same relief. It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. Accounting for Loss Contingencies We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. As of January 27, 2019, with the exception of immaterial amounts, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 65 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 13 - Income Taxes The income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions) Current income taxes: Federal $ 1 $ 464 $ 7 State — 1 1 Foreign 69 43 34 Total current 70 508 42 Deferred taxes: Federal (315 ) (376 ) 199 State — — — Foreign — 17 (2 ) Total deferred (315 ) (359 ) 197 Income tax expense (benefit) $ (245 ) $ 149 $ 239 Income before income tax consists of the following: Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions) Domestic (1) $ 1,843 $ 1,600 $ 600 Foreign 2,053 1,596 1,305 Income before income tax $ 3,896 $ 3,196 $ 1,905 (1) The increase in domestic income is primarily due to jurisdictional allocation of stock-based compensation charges. The income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% , 33.9% , and 35% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, to income before income taxes as follows: Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions) Tax expense computed at federal statutory rate $ 818 $ 1,084 $ 667 Expense (benefit) resulting from: State income taxes, net of federal tax effect 23 10 4 Foreign tax rate differential (412 ) (545 ) (315 ) Stock-based compensation (191 ) (181 ) (70 ) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (368 ) (133 ) — U.S. federal R&D tax credit (141 ) (87 ) (52 ) Other 26 1 5 Income tax expense (benefit) $ (245 ) $ 149 $ 239 66 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below: January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 70 $ 67 Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes 41 24 Property, equipment and intangible assets 2 32 Research and other tax credit carryforwards 626 579 Stock-based compensation 25 24 GILTI deferred tax assets 376 — Gross deferred tax assets 1,140 726 Less valuation allowance (562 ) (469 ) Total deferred tax assets 578 257 Deferred tax liabilities: Acquired intangibles (2 ) (4 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (35 ) (26 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities (37 ) (30 ) Net deferred tax asset (1) $ 541 $ 227 (1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $560 million and $245 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $19 million and $18 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets are included in Other assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized an income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019, and income tax expense of $149 million and $239 million for fiscal years 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was (6.3)% , 4.7% , and 12.5% for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. In December 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA significantly changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% , a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI) on certain foreign-source earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the TCJA by applying the SEC guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects. As of January 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA and recognized a reduction of $368 million to the provisional amount recorded at January 28, 2018 as a component of income tax expense (benefit). This adjustment primarily relates to the effects of electing to account for GILTI in deferred taxes, as described below. Our final tax benefit from the TCJA was $501 million . The one-time transition tax is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits, or E&P, of our foreign subsidiaries. We had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of these same earnings. We recorded a provisional one-time transition tax liability of $971 million at January 28, 2018. Upon further analysis of the TCJA and Notices and regulations issued by the US Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, we finalized our calculations of the transition tax liability during fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, we increased our transition tax provisional amount by $33 million . As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% , companies were required to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. As a result, at January 28, 2018 we had recorded a provisional income tax expense of $43 million on the write-down of our deferred tax balance. Upon further analysis of certain aspects of the TJCA, including immediate expensing of qualified capital expenditures and refinement of our calculations, we reduced our provisional tax expense amount by $20 million . 67 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The TCJA subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. Under U.S. GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Because we were still evaluating the GILTI provisions as of January 28, 2018, we recorded no GILTI-related deferred balances. After further evaluation, we elected to account for GILTI deferred taxes. In fiscal year 2019, we recorded additional deferred tax assets as a net $370 million income tax benefit related to GILTI in deferred taxes. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21% , the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higher U.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, favorable recognition of the U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 and 35% for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. As of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018, we had a valuation allowance of $562 million and $469 million , respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period. As of January 27, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $72 million , $291 million and $290 million , respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2023 and 2020, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $290 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 27, 2019, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $347 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2037. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $718 million , of which $687 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $31 million is attributable to various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal year 2020. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization. As of January 27, 2019, we had $477 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $432 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, approximately $82 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $432 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 27, 2019 consisted of $142 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $290 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets. 68 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 447 $ 224 $ 230 Increases in tax positions for prior years 52 7 3 Decreases in tax positions for prior years (141 ) (1 ) — Increases in tax positions for current year 129 222 46 Settlements — — (48 ) Lapse in statute of limitations (10 ) (5 ) (7 ) Balance at end of period $ 477 $ 447 $ 224 We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 27, 2019 , January 28, 2018 , and January 29, 2017 , we had accrued $21 million , $15 million , and $13 million , respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 27, 2019 , unrecognized tax benefits of $142 million and the related interest and penalties of $21 million are included in non-current income taxes payable. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 27, 2019, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. We are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States and throughout the world. As of January 27, 2019, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2018. As of January 27, 2019, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include India, Taiwan, China and UK for fiscal years 2003 through 2018. Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity Capital Return Program Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. During fiscal year 2019 , we repurchased a total of 9 million shares for $1.58 billion and also paid $371 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. Through January 27, 2019 , we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08 billion . All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. In November 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program. As of January 27, 2019 , we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. Preferred Stock As of January 27, 2019 and January 28, 2018 , there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. Common Stock We are authorized to issue up to 2.00 billion shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share par value. 69 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 15 - Employee Retirement Plans We have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, participating employees may defer up to 80% of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits and we match a portion of the employee contributions. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 was $39 million , $23 million , and $12 million , respectively. We also have defined contribution retirement plans outside of the United States to which we contributed $31 million , $25 million , and $23 million for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Note 16 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying graphics architecture. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category. 70 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) GPU Tegra Processor All Other Consolidated (In millions) Year Ended January 27, 2019: Revenue $ 10,175 $ 1,541 $ — $ 11,716 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 197 $ 47 $ 18 $ 262 Operating income (loss) $ 4,443 $ 241 $ (880 ) $ 3,804 Year Ended January 28, 2018: Revenue $ 8,137 $ 1,534 $ 43 $ 9,714 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 123 $ 37 $ 39 $ 199 Operating income (loss) $ 3,507 $ 303 $ (600 ) $ 3,210 Year Ended January 29, 2017: Revenue $ 5,822 $ 824 $ 264 $ 6,910 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 116 $ 29 $ 42 $ 187 Operating income (loss) $ 2,180 $ (9 ) $ (237 ) $ 1,934 Year Ended January 27, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In millions) Reconciling items included in ""All Other"" category: Unallocated revenue $ — $ 43 $ 264 Stock-based compensation expense (557 ) (391 ) (247 ) Unallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses (277 ) (237 ) (215 ) Legal settlement costs (44 ) — (16 ) Acquisition-related and other costs (2 ) (15 ) (23 ) Total $ (880 ) $ (600 ) $ (237 ) Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location.

CapStar’s underwriting guidelines are reviewed regularly and approved annually by our Board of Directors. Our underwriting process includes: Our underwriting processes collaboratively engage our bankers and credit underwriters in the analysis of each loan request. We manage our credit risks by analyzing metrics in order to maintain a conservative and well-diversified loan portfolio reflective of our assessment of various subsets within our market. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ a tiered review of loan originations that may involve joint line and credit authorization, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. Our strategy for credit risk management includes the disciplined underwriting process described above and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all loan exposures. Our Chief Credit Officer provides bank-wide credit oversight and regularly reviews the loan portfolio to ensure that the underwriting and risk identification processes are functioning properly. We strive to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans become delinquent or impaired, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Annually, we submit ourselves to review by independent third parties to validate our internal oversight. Market Area and Competition CapStar operates in the community markets of Athens, Lawrenceburg/Waynesboro, and Manchester, Tennessee as well as the metropolitan markets of Asheville, North Carolina and Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Nashville, Tennessee which are included among the fastest growing nationally. The bank seeks business development and serves customers through a team of commercial relationship managers and its 23 banking locations. The financial services industry is highly competitive and each of these markets has a significant presence of other financial service providers. In particular, we estimate that, as of June 30, 2022, Tennessee included more than 80 financial institutions with over $118 billion in deposits. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area, internet-based banks, and out-of-market banks that advertise in or otherwise serve our market area, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. We expect to continue to face increasing competition. Expansion and Acquisitions In January of 2020, the Company announced its first out of market expansion hiring a Knoxville commercial banking team. In October of 2021, the Company announced the hiring of a Chattanooga commercial banking team. In July of 2022, the Company announced its expansion to Asheville, NC through the hiring of a commercial banking team. During this period, the Company also hired additional commercial and retail bankers within its existing markets. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company announced the hiring of an experienced financial professional to expand the SBA division. On July 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of FCB Corporation (“FCB”), the bank holding company for the First National Bank of Manchester. The Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of 2 FCB for approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock. At the time of acquisition, Manchester had four banking locations throughout middle Tennessee. The operations of Manchester are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020. On July 1, 2020, the Company also completed the acquisition of the Bank of Waynesboro (“BOW”). The Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of BOW for approximately 0.7 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of acquisition, BOW had six banking locations throughout Southern Tennessee. The operations of BOW are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020. Human Capital As of December 31, 2022, we had 397 total employees. As a service-oriented business, our long-term success depends on our people and we are committed to taking a multi-dimensional approach to talent and culture. Our people and culture are critical to the Company’s long-term success. As such, our talent vision and strategy focus on: SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance and that of our subsidiaries may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (""TDFI""), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitizations and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results and those of our bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of insured banks, their holding companies and affiliates that are intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and enter into acquisitions with other companies, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective primary federal regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and 3 performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and our bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. Bank Holding Company Regulation Since we own all of the capital stock of our bank, we are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Acquisition of Banks The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before: Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of the above transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources includes a focus on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section titled “Item 1. Business—Regulation and Supervision—Capital Adequacy.” The Federal Reserve also considers the effectiveness of the institutions in combating money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering program of the acquiring bank holding company and the anti-money laundering compliance records of a bank to be acquired as part of the transaction. Finally, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration the extent to which the proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Under the BHC Act, if well-capitalized and well-managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. In each case, however, state law may place restrictions on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for at least three years. Change in Bank Control Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute acquisition of “control” of the bank holding company if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the transaction or the bank holding company has registered securities under the Exchange Act. In addition, any person or group of persons acting in concert must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25% (or 5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, the right to 4 control in any manner the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the bank holding company. Permitted Activities Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities: Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include: The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. Support of Subsidiary Institutions The Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. As a result of a bank holding company’s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank. Repurchase or Redemption of Securities A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions. 5 Bank Regulation and Supervision Our bank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of the operations of our bank. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the safety and soundness of our bank and our bank’s depositors, rather than our shareholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to our bank. Since our bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the state of Tennessee and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI regularly examine our bank’s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Our bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. Our bank is also subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations. Branching Under current Tennessee law, our bank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of, or prior notice to, the TDFI and the Federal Reserve. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, our bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Tennessee. Under federal law, our bank may establish branch offices with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. While prior law imposed various limits on the ability of banks to establish new branches in states other than their home state, the Dodd-Frank Act allows a bank to branch into a new state by setting up a new branch if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. This makes it much simpler for banks to open de novo branches in other states. FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor, per ownership category. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the assessment rate is determined by the risk category assigned to an institution based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations which are designed to measure risk, with riskier institutions paying a higher assessment rate. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC. Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our bank’s record of performance under the CRA is publicly available. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. As of December 31, 2022 the Bank had a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” Interest Rate Limitations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by our bank are subject to applicable state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. 6 Federal Laws Applicable to Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions Our bank’s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including: Capital Adequacy Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, under the adopted regulations, the Basel member central bank and federal bank regulators approved the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord, or Basel III. The U.S. Basel III rule’s minimum capital to risk-weighted assets, or RWA, requirements are as follows: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The rule also changed the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Basel III rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital. Under the U.S. Basel III rule, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016, and the requirements became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization maintaining capital levels in excess of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. A banking organization also would be prohibited from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework requires us to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios of (i) 7% for common equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5% total capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. With the capital conservation buffer fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action, or PCA, well-capitalized thresholds. 7 Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a banking institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into which all insured depository institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds and other qualitative requirements for each of those categories. For an insured depository institution to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2022, our bank qualified for the “well capitalized” category. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new markets or product offerings, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with Federal Reserve approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. Liquidity Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. This scrutiny has increased during recent years, as the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s negatively affected the liquidity of many financial institutions. Various bank regulatory publications, including Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management) and FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-84-2008 (Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions. 8 Payment of Dividends We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, is dividends our bank pays to us as our bank’s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to our bank’s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our shareholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Tennessee corporate law which prevents payment of dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our board of directors must consider our and our bank’s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs. The TDFI also regulates our bank’s dividend payments. Under Tennessee law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend without prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (i) the total of its retained net income for that year, plus (ii) its retained net income for the preceding two years. Our bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Our bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of the bank’s transactions with its affiliates. Subject to various exceptions, the total amount of the bank’s transactions with affiliates is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, transactions with affiliates also must meet specified collateral requirements and safety and soundness requirements. Our bank must also comply with provisions prohibiting the acquisition of low-quality assets from an affiliate. Our bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in transactions with affiliates, as well as other types of transactions set forth in Section 23B, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Our bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions between the bank and third parties, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There are also individual and aggregate limitations on loans to insiders and their related interests. The aggregate amount of insider loans generally cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus. Insiders and banks are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly entering into insider loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Single Borrower Credit Limits Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. 9 Commercial Real Estate Concentration In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.” Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2022, our bank’s total CRE loans represented 262% of total capital. Privacy Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting non-public personal information of their clients. Clients generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing non-public personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. Consumer Credit Reporting The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) imposes, among other things: Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation Our bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank has established an anti-money laundering program pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act and customer identification program pursuant to the USA Patriot Act. The bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. Our bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements. Overdraft Fees Federal Reserve Regulation E restricts banks’ abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. 10 The Dodd-Frank Act As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this new law has significantly changed and is significantly changing the bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on the rules and regulations that implement it. A number of the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this “Supervision and Regulation” section. The following items provide a brief description of certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and our bank. The Volcker Rule On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted a final rule implementing the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits any “banking entity” from engaging in proprietary trading or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with covered funds (i.e., hedge funds or private equity funds). In addition, the Volcker Rule requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule. 11 On October 8, 2019, the agencies finalized revisions to the Volcker Rule that, among other things, simplified and streamlined compliance requirements for banking entities that do not have significant trading activities, while banking entities with significant trading activity would become subject to more stringent compliance requirements. Further, the revisions to the Volcker Rule implemented Section 203 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which amended the definition of “banking entity” to exclude certain community banks from the definition of insured depository institution, the general result of which was to exclude such banks and their affiliates and subsidiaries from the scope of the Volcker Rule. Under EGRRCPA, a community bank and its affiliates are generally excluded from the definition of “banking entity” if the bank and all companies that control the bank have total consolidated assets equal to $10 billion or less and trading assets and liabilities equal to five percent or less of total consolidated assets. These revisions became effective on January 1, 2020, with a required compliance date of January 1, 2021. Limitations on Incentive Compensation In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and our bank, the proposal imposes principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions are prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal also imposes certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. The Federal Reserve reserves the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. Cybersecurity Cybersecurity is a high-priority item for legislators and regulators at the federal and state levels, as well as internationally. State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements and, in some cases, regulations, emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision. Such policy statements and regulations indicate that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. These requirements, including state regulatory rules such as the detailed and extensive cybersecurity rules issued in 2016 by the New York State Department of Financial Services, may cause us to incur significant additional compliance costs and in some cases may impact our growth prospects. Additionally, if we fail to observe federal or state regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. The Company has an Information Technology (IT) Steering Committee comprised of internal managers representing various divisions of the Company. The Committee oversees IT strategic and investment priorities and the Company’s Information Security Program. The Committee regularly reports to the Risk Committee of the Board through distribution of meeting minutes and other presentations and communication, including a comprehensive overview of the Company’s cyber and information security program annually. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We also employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, as attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume and complexity, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Financial expenditures may also be required to meet regulatory changes in the information security and cybersecurity domains. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks 12 are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See “Item 1A. – Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity. Federal statutes and regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, limit our ability to disclose non-public information about consumers, customers and employees to nonaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the GLBA requires us to disclose our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing non-public information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. The GLBA also requires us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and, if applicable state law is more protective of customer privacy than the GLBA, financial institutions, including our bank, will be required to comply with such state law. Other laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. Proposed or new legislation and regulations may also significantly increase our compliance cost and impede our ability to grow into specific markets. There are a number of proposals that have either recently been adopted or are currently pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. In addition, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) on June 28, 2018. Both the GDPR and the CCPA impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. In the event of a data breach, there are mandatory reporting requirements that may hamper the ability to fully assess an incident prior to external reporting. We must maintain awareness of additional legal and regulatory requirements that apply to existing and future subsets of the customer base for protection against legal, reputational, and financial risk due to compliance failures.

RI SK FACTORS This Item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile or materially affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Many of these risks are beyond our control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing financial and operational results, and our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. This Item highlights risks that could affect us in material ways by causing future results to differ materially from past results, by causing future results to differ materially from current expectations, or by causing material changes in our financial condition. Some of these risks are interrelated and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others. You should carefully read and consider the following risks factors, together with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Report before investing in shares of our common stock. Risks Related To Our Business Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by global pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and future variants. The COVID-19 pandemic created extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. Business and consumer customers of the Company have experienced varying degrees of financial distress as a result of the unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, it will likely take time for the U.S. economy to recover, and the length of the recovery period is unknown. The Company's business could be materially and adversely affected during any such recovery period. To the extent the effects of COVID-19 or other global pandemics adversely impact the Company's business and financial results, it might also have a heightening effect of the other risks described in this section. As a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions. Our business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic and other conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder United States economic growth. Weak economic conditions may be characterized by numerous factors; such as deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. All of these factors can individually or in the aggregate be detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our business and operations are concentrated in our Target Market (References herein to our “Target Market” includes the state of Tennessee, Asheville, NC, and geographical areas within a 100-mile radius of any of our banking locations), and we are more sensitive than our more geographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy. Unlike with many of our larger competitors that maintain significant operations located outside our market area, substantially all of our clients are individuals and businesses located and doing business in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 92% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market. Therefore, our success will depend in large part upon the general economic conditions in this area, which we cannot predict with certainty. As a result, our operations and profitability may be more adversely affected by a local economic downturn in our Target Market than those of larger, more geographically diverse competitors. From time to time, our bank may provide financing to clients who own or have companies or properties located outside our Target Market. In such cases, we would face similar local market risk in those communities for these clients. 14 Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability. The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, internet banks, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our service area. These competitors have differing levels of marketing resources, capital, regulatory requirements, and funding. We compete with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits, in making loans, and in hiring staff. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with an array of financial institutions in our service area. Our reputation is critical to our business, and damage to it could have a material adverse effect on us . The Company faces threats to its reputation from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver expected standards of service or quality, regulatory compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of the Company’s employees and customers. Negative publicity may arise regarding the Company’s business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, and could result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenue, and increased regulatory oversight. Credit and Interest Rate Risks The Company is subject to lending risk, and the impacts of interest rate changes could adversely impact the Company. There are inherent risks associated with the Company’s lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the Company operates. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company to regulatory enforcement action that could result in restrictions of the Company's activities or the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Company. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 35% of our loan portfolio was composed of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 11% of owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 17% consumer real estate loans, and 10% construction and land development loans. The Company's concentration of loans secured by real estate may subject the Company to additional risk, such as fluctuations in market value of collateral, environmental liability associated with hazardous or toxic substances found on, in or around the collateral, and difficulty monitoring income-producing property serving as a source of repayment and collateral. Additionally, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Weak economic conditions or other market factors can result in increased vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial property. The adequacy of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. Additionally, we target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive, economic or financial pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We may not be able to adequately assess and limit our credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability. A primary component of our business involves making loans to clients. The business of lending is inherently risky because the principal of or interest on the loan may not be repaid timely or at all or the value of any collateral supporting the loan may be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower’s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring our loan applicants and the concentration of our loans and our credit approval practices, may not adequately assess credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively assess and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could 15 have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management’s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes in a relatively short time period. Inaccurate management assumptions, continuing deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan portfolio and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and may require adjustments based upon judgments that are different than those of management. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, we may need to increase our provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for such losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The value of real estate collateral may fluctuate significantly resulting in an under-collateralized loan portfolio. The market value of real estate, particularly real estate held for investment, can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. If the value of the real estate serving as collateral for the Company's loan portfolio were to decline materially, a significant part of the Company's loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. If the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined, then, in the event of foreclosure, we may not be able to realize the amount of collateral that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's provision for credit losses and the Company's operating results and financial condition. We engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral and own the underlying real estate, subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property. Since we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to general or local economic conditions, environmental cleanup liability, neighborhood assessments, interest rates, real estate tax rates, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, supply of and demand for rental units or properties, ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties, zoning laws, governmental and regulatory rules, fiscal policies, and natural disasters. Our inability to manage the amount of costs or size of the risks associated with the ownership of real estate, or write-downs in the value of other real estate owned, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We have several large depositor relationships, the loss of which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources. As of December 31, 2022, our ten largest non-brokered depositors accounted for approximately 11% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and our funding sources may be insufficient to fund our future growth. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds, at competitive rates or at all, through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Approximately 74% of our bank’s deposits as of December 31, 2022 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice, while by comparison, 74% of the assets of our bank were loans at 16 December 31, 2022, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Additionally, secondary market residential loans may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach representations or warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including government-sponsored entities, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet deposit withdrawals and other client needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our asset growth, new business transactions, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Changes to interest rates could impact the financial outcomes of the Company. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest income the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Company’s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Company’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. The Company’s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company’s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company’s net interest income, and therefore its earnings and net profit, could be adversely affected. Earnings also could be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Changes in interest rates may also negatively affect the ability of the Company's borrowers to repay their loans, particularly as interest rates rise and adjustable-rate loans become more expensive. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments, to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company’s results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. See the section Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Market and Liquidity Risk Management – Interest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis"" located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company’s management of interest rate risk. The fair value of our investment securities could fluctuate because of factors outside of our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Factors beyond our control could significantly affect the fair value of our investment securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments (""OTTI"") and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in earnings and/or other comprehensive income (loss), which could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is OTTI usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer, any collateral underlying the security as well as the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the 17 security. Our failure to assess any impairments or losses with respect to our securities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Strategic Risks Acquisition and other growth opportunities may present challenges . Any future acquisitions may result in unforeseen difficulties, which could require significant time and attention from the Company’s management that would otherwise be directed at developing its existing business and managing expenses. In addition, the Company could discover undisclosed liabilities resulting from any acquisitions for which it may become responsible. Further, the benefits that the Company anticipates from these acquisitions may not develop. We may experience difficulty integrating businesses acquired through mergers and acquisitions and may fail to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in market presence, and other projected benefits from acquisition activity. Acquisitions utilizing the Company’s common stock as consideration may dilute the value of the Company’s common stock, which dilution may not be recouped or recovered for a significant amount of time after the acquisition, if ever. Any merger or acquisition opportunity that we decide to pursue will ultimately be subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. We may expend significant time and resources pursing potential acquisitions that are never consummated due to lack of regulatory approval or other issues. Competition for acquisition candidates in the banking industry is intense. We may expend significant time and resources evaluating acquisition candidates and conducting due diligence that does not lead to an acquisition opportunity. The Company may implement new lines of business, enter new market areas, or offer new products and services from time to time. There can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. The Company may invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new lines of business, but the benefits that the Company anticipates from these activities may not develop as expected. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may impact the Company’s ability to successfully implement organic growth strategies. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future to fund such growth, and the unavailability of additional capital on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect us or our growth. We believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our capital needs for our immediate growth plans. However, we will continue to need capital to support our longer-term growth plans. If capital is not available on favorable terms when we need it, we may have to either issue common stock or other securities on less than desirable terms or reduce our rate of growth until market conditions become more favorable. Either of such events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 18 Operational Risks Deterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and federal agency securities could adversely affect us and our banking operations. In addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any future downgrade, failure to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the U.S. federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. In particular, such events could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect our profitability. Also, the adverse consequences of any downgrade could extend to those to whom we extend credit and could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, other third parties, and our employees. When we originate loans, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal, title information and employment and income documentation. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the fair value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, the borrower, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. The persons and entities involved in such a misrepresentation are often difficult to locate, and we are often unable to collect any monetary losses that we have suffered from them. We may bear costs associated with the proliferation of computer theft and cyber-crime. We necessarily collect, use and hold sensitive data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with client expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. Although we actively invest in the security of our technological infrastructure, it is not feasible to defend against every risk posed by rapid technological development and the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our information technology department and third-party vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our employees or other internal sources, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our client accounts may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from network failures, viruses and malware, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters and catastrophic events. A breach of our security or the security of our third-party vendors that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, client notification requirements, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage, any of which could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 19 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us. Our risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, liquidity, capital, financial performance, asset/liability, operational, compliance and regulatory, Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, strategic and reputational, information technology and legal. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances, including if our management fails to follow our credit policies and procedures, and thus, it may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. We depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption in the operation of these systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of clients, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data. We rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio accounting. For example, one vendor provides our core banking system through a service bureau arrangement. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of client data. We may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. We may need to switch third-party service providers from time-to-time, which could result in disruption to our business processes, damage to our reputation and a breach of our data security measures. Such a disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. We encounter technological change continually and have fewer resources than certain of our competitors to invest in technological improvements. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to serving clients better, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our success will depend in part on our ability to address our clients’ needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than us, and in the future, we may not be able to implement new technology-driven products and services timely, effectively or at all or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may, in order to remain competitive, be required to make significant capital expenditures, which may increase our overall expenses and have a material adverse effect on our net income. There is also no guarantee that any such investment in these products and services will create additional efficiencies in our operations. 20 We may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems in the past and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk. We use interest rate swaps to help manage our interest rate risk from recorded financial assets and liabilities when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and the asset or liability exposes us to interest rate risk. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and routine monitoring, and is not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. We also have derivatives that result from a service we provide to certain qualifying clients approved through our credit process, and therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the uncollateralized fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rate changes cause the value of our derivatives to decline – though to the extent the derivatives are effective hedges, changes in the value of derivative derivatives could be largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged item. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The Company’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Any failure or circumvention of the Company’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Changes in tax law and accounting standards could materially affect the Company's operations. Changes in tax laws, or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, could materially adversely affect the Company’s operations. Similarly, new accounting standards, changes to existing accounting standards, and changes to the methods of preparing financial statements could impact the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. These factors are outside the Company’s control and it is impossible to predict changes that may occur and the effect of such changes. The adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (""CECL"") model will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the current “incurred loss” model for recognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the “incurred loss” model required under current generally accepted accounting principles, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require 21 us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company is currently finalizing its assessment of the adoption and ongoing impact, along with testing and finalization of internal controls relative to the adoption of CECL. At this time, the Company expects its allowance for credit losses related to all financial assets will increase in 2023 to approximately $28.0 to $29.0 million upon adoption compared to its allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2022 of approximately $24.1 million. The Company will initially apply the impact of the new guidance through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption, which, for the Company, is January 1, 2023. Future adjustments to credit loss expectations will be recorded through the income statement as charges or credits to earnings. We may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings will cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be published as of December 31, 2021. The Company discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021. As described in Note One of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, management has reviewed all contracts, identified those that will be affected, and will transition the LIBOR based loans to SOFR, or another index, by June 30, 2023. Nevertheless, the transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk. Small Business Administration lending and other government guaranteed lending is an important part of our business. Our government guaranteed lending programs are dependent upon the U.S. federal government, and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA and other government guaranteed loans. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the U.S. federal government. As an approved participant in the SBA Preferred Lender’s Program (an “SBA Preferred Lender”), we enable our customers to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender’s SBA Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we could experience a material adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, changes to program-specific rules impacting volume eligibility under the guaranty program, as well as changes to the program amounts authorized by Congress, may also have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any default by the U.S. government on its obligations or any prolonged government shutdown could impede our ability to originate SBA loans or other government guaranteed loans or sell such loans in the secondary market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Generally, we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. These sales result in premium income for us at the time of sale and create a stream of future servicing income, as we retain the servicing rights to these loans. For the reasons described above, we may not be able to continue originating these loans or sell them in the secondary market. Furthermore, even if we are able to continue to originate and sell SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market, we might not continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans, or the premiums may decline due to economic and competitive factors. When we originate SBA loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us. Generally, we do not maintain reserves or loss allowances for such potential claims and any such claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to government guaranteed loan products may change in the future. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies and especially our organization, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to government guaranteed loans could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. 22 The recognition of gains on the sale of loans and servicing asset valuations reflect certain assumptions. We continue to expect that gains on the sale of U.S. government guaranteed loans will continue to comprise a significant component of our revenue. The gain on such sales recognized for year ended December 31, 2022 was $2.5 million. The determination of these gains is based on assumptions regarding the value of unguaranteed loans retained, servicing rights retained and deferred fees and costs, and net premiums paid by purchasers of the guaranteed portions of U.S. government guaranteed loans. The value of retained unguaranteed loans and servicing rights are determined based on market-derived factors such as prepayment rates, current market conditions and recent loan sales. Deferred fees and costs are determined using internal analysis of the cost to originate loans. Significant errors in assumptions used to compute gains on sale of loans or servicing asset valuations could result in material revenue misstatements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and profitability. In addition, while we believe these valuations reflect fair value and such valuations are subject to validation by an independent third-party, if such valuations are not reflective of fair market value then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Regulatory, Compliance, and Legal Risks We operate in an extensively regulated industry. The Company operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, the TDFI and the FDIC. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters including but not limited to (i) ownership and control of the Company's equity, (ii) acquisition of other companies and businesses, (iii) permissible activities, (iv) maintenance of adequate capital levels and (v) other operational aspects. Compliance with banking regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including the payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loan amounts and concentrations, interest rates, opening and closing branch locations, and other activities. The bank regulatory agencies also possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. These agencies have significant discretion in their ability to enforce penalties and further limit the Company's activities if the Company fails to comply with applicable regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the bank and financial institutions regulatory regimes, and additional changes continue to be proposed and implemented by various regulatory agencies. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to reduced revenues, additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. The burden and expenses associated with regulatory compliance have been increasing and may continue to increase. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing financial institutions are frequently raised in Congress and before bank regulatory authorities. Changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially affect the Company’s business, and the likelihood of any major changes in the future and their effects are impossible to determine. Moreover, it is impossible to predict the ultimate form any proposed legislation might take or how it might affect the Company. We are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress. Under federal law and long-standing Federal Reserve policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our bank, and to commit resources to support our bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our shareholders’ or creditors,’ best interests to do so. A requirement to provide such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of repayment to deposit liabilities of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment over general unsecured creditor claims. 23 We are or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of lawsuits and related legal proceedings, governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm. Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we may not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings or government or other inquiries. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly materially so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Even though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange. The trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. A future issuance or future issuances of stock could dilute the value of our common stock. Our charter permits us to issue up to an aggregate of 25 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, 21,714,380 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, including 170,426 shares of restricted common stock that have yet to vest. Those shares outstanding do not include the potential issuance, as of December 31, 2022, of 124,445 shares of our common stock subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options under the Stock Incentive Plan, and 1,118,225 additional shares of our common stock that were reserved for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan. A future issuance of any new shares of our common stock would, and equity-related securities could, cause further dilution in the value of our outstanding shares of common stock. Significant sales of our common stock by certain shareholders could affect the market value of our common stock. Certain shares owned by larger shareholders represent a significant number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and, if sold in the market all at once or at about the same time, could depress the market price of our common stock and could further affect our ability to raise equity capital. Further, we cannot predict the size or the effect, if any, that sales of these shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may have on the market price of our shares of common stock or our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Any significant sales of these shares could have a materially adverse impact on our affairs, assets, business, cash flows, 24 condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, short- and long-term performance goals, prospects and results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in our bank, to secure that debt. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, interest must be paid to a lender before dividends can be paid to our shareholders, and, in the case of liquidation, our borrowings must be repaid before we can distribute any assets to our shareholders. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if our bank were profitable. The rights of our common shareholders would likely be subordinate to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue an aggregate of up to five million shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. Accordingly, you should assume that any shares of preferred stock that we may issue in the future will also be senior to our common stock. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. We and our bank are subject to capital and other legal and regulatory requirements which restrict our ability to pay dividends. We are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. In addition, because our bank is our only material asset, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on our receipt of dividends from the bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. General Risks We are dependent on the services of our management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key personnel or directors may adversely affect our business and operations. We are led by an experienced core management team with substantial experience in the markets that we serve, and our operating strategy focuses on providing products and services through long-term relationship managers and ensuring that our largest clients have relationships with our senior management team. Accordingly, our success depends in large part on the performance of these key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. If any of our executive officers, other key personnel, or directors leaves us or our bank, our operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, our directors’ community involvement and diverse and extensive local business relationships are important to our success. Severe weather, natural disasters, nuclear fallout, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact the Company's business. Severe weather, natural disasters, nuclear fallout, health emergencies, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events, especially those that directly affect the Company’s market areas, could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. These events could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, decrease the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property and infrastructure damage, and affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base. The Company may experience decreased revenue, increased charge-offs, and other expenses. 25 Climate change and societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including indirectly through impact to our customers. The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require businesses to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. It is not possible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, we operate in areas where our business and the activities of our customers could be impacted by the effects of climate change. The effects of climate change may include increased frequency or severity of weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts and rising sea levels. These effects can disrupt business operations, damage property, devalue assets and change customer and business preferences, which may adversely affect borrowers, increase credit risk and reduce demand for our products and services. The Company and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. As a result, the Company and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes and the like. The impact to our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVE D STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under the caption “Part II., Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law. The following discussion and analysis pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, the following discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level. All dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when otherwise specifically noted. Unless specifically noted in this Report, all references in this section to the fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022 mean our fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Application of these policies requires management to make numerous estimates, assumptions or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, it could materially and adversely affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions or judgments and as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate. Allowance for Loan Losses We record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit-worthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses, including any remaining impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different from our estimates. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk 30 classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is included elsewhere in this Report. Investment Securities Impairment We assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security in an unrealized loss position is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded in earnings. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is “more likely than not” that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period, and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits. Business Combinations Assets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the loans are considered impaired, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted as necessary for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisions that may be required. 31 Results of Operations The following is a summary of our results of operations: 2022-2021 2021-2020 Year ended Percent Year ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2020 (Decrease) Interest income $ 113,533 $ 98,459 15.3 % $ 91,852 7.2 % Interest expense 17,441 7,289 139.3 % 15,529 (53.1 )% Net interest income 96,092 91,170 5.4 % 76,323 19.5 % Provision for loan losses 2,474 (1,066 ) 332.1 % 11,479 (109.3 )% Net interest income after provision for loan losses 93,618 92,236 1.5 % 64,844 42.2 % Noninterest income 24,522 42,681 (42.5 )% 43,248 (1.3 )% Noninterest expense 69,370 73,541 (5.7 )% 77,361 (4.9 )% Net income before income taxes 48,770 61,376 (20.5 )% 30,731 99.7 % Income tax expense 9,753 12,699 (23.2 )% 6,035 110.4 % Net income $ 39,017 $ 48,677 (19.8 )% $ 24,696 97.1 % Basic net income per share of common stock $ 1.77 $ 2.20 (19.5 )% $ 1.22 80.3 % Diluted net income per share of common stock $ 1.77 $ 2.19 (19.2 )% $ 1.22 79.5 % The following sections provide a more detailed analysis of significant factors affecting our operating results. Net Interest Income The largest component of our net income is net interest income – the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets and interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by total average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, mix, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our net interest income. 32 The following table sets forth the average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Interest-Earning Assets Loans (1) $ 2,176,073 $ 97,759 4.49 % $ 1,910,115 $ 84,368 4.42 % $ 1,690,179 $ 78,180 4.63 % Loans held for sale 84,171 3,742 4.45 % 152,482 4,851 3.18 % 175,311 6,092 3.47 % Securities: Taxable investment securities (2) 400,204 8,427 2.11 % 441,495 7,213 1.63 % 250,042 5,455 2.18 % Investment securities exempt from federal income tax (3) 55,310 1,267 2.90 % 61,438 1,408 2.90 % 49,474 1,326 3.39 % Total securities 455,514 9,694 2.20 % 502,933 8,621 1.79 % 299,516 6,781 2.38 % Cash balances in other banks 172,746 2,262 1.31 % 317,406 598 0.19 % 307,852 799 0.26 % Funds sold 7,546 76 1.01 % 14,640 21 0.14 % 18 — 2.77 % Total interest-earning assets 2,896,050 113,533 3.93 % 2,897,576 98,459 3.41 % 2,472,876 91,852 3.73 % Noninterest-earning assets 242,384 224,776 149,760 Total assets $ 3,138,434 $ 3,122,352 $ 2,622,636 Interest-Bearing Liabilities Interest bearing deposits: Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 856,344 4,479 0.52 % $ 955,553 1,626 0.17 % $ 744,144 3,868 0.52 % Savings and money market deposits 689,825 5,102 0.74 % 594,652 1,203 0.20 % 549,533 5,196 0.95 % Time deposits 450,005 5,421 1.20 % 417,770 2,873 0.69 % 407,224 5,317 1.31 % Total interest-bearing deposits 1,996,174 15,002 0.75 % 1,967,975 5,702 0.29 % 1,700,901 14,381 0.85 % Borrowings and repurchase agreements 66,051 2,439 3.69 % 30,574 1,587 5.19 % 27,809 1,148 4.13 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 2,062,225 17,441 0.85 % 1,998,549 7,289 0.36 % 1,728,710 15,529 0.90 % Noninterest-bearing deposits 676,617 725,075 558,416 Total funding sources 2,738,842 2,723,624 2,287,126 Noninterest-bearing liabilities 36,339 34,969 29,762 Shareholders’ equity 363,253 363,759 305,748 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 3,138,434 $ 3,122,352 $ 2,622,636 Net interest spread (4) 3.09 % 3.05 % 2.83 % Net interest income/margin (5) $ 96,092 3.33 % $ 91,170 3.16 % $ 76,323 3.10 % 33 The following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates earned or paid on these assets and liabilities. 2022 Compared to 2021 2021 Compared to 2020 Increase (decrease) due to Increase (decrease) due to Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net Interest-Earning Assets Loans $ 11,747 $ 1,644 $ 13,391 $ 10,173 $ (3,985 ) $ 6,188 Loans held for sale (2,173 ) 1,064 (1,109 ) (793 ) (448 ) (1,241 ) Securities: Taxable investment securities (675 ) 1,889 1,214 4,148 (2,390 ) 1,758 Investment securities exempt from federal income tax (140 ) (1 ) (141 ) 379 (297 ) 82 Total securities (815 ) 1,888 1,073 4,527 (2,687 ) 1,840 Cash balances in other banks (273 ) 1,937 1,664 25 (226 ) (201 ) Funds Sold (10 ) 65 55 405 (384 ) 21 Total interest-earning assets 8,476 6,598 15,074 14,337 (7,730 ) 6,607 Interest-Bearing Liabilities Interest-bearing transaction accounts (169 ) 3,022 2,853 1,099 (3,341 ) (2,242 ) Savings and money market deposits 192 3,707 3,899 427 (4,420 ) (3,993 ) Time deposits 222 2,326 2,548 138 (2,582 ) (2,444 ) Borrowings and repurchase agreements 1,841 (989 ) 852 114 325 439 Total interest-bearing liabilities 2,086 8,066 10,152 1,778 (10,018 ) (8,240 ) Net Interest Income $ 6,390 $ (1,468 ) $ 4,922 $ 12,559 $ 2,288 $ 14,847 2022 compared to 2021 Our net interest income increased $4.9 million, or 5.4%, from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to a 13.9% increase in average loans held for investment partially offset by a 46 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits as market rates increased sharply throughout 2022 and customers shifted into higher cost deposit categories. The $266.0 million increase in average loans held for investment is primarily attributable to the recent expansion into the Asheville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville markets, and the transfer of Tri-Net loans held for sale to loans held for investment offset by PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. Our expansion into these new markets contributed $236.4 million to the increase in average loans while loans transferred from held for sale contributed $66.4 million to the increase. The transfer of Tri-Net loans held for sale to loans held for investment was due to the adverse impact of rapidly rising interest rates on pricing and investor demand. Average PPP loans decreased $123.7 million in 2022 when compared to 2021. PPP fees recognized as income totaled $0.7 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 also benefited from a 76 basis point or 80.0% increase in yields on average cash balances in other banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities which was offset by a decrease in their average balances of $199.2 million, or 23.9% as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates over the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to historically low levels experienced in the year ended December 31, 2021. 2021 compared to 2020 Our net interest income increased $14.8 million, or 19.5%, from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a 13.0% increase in average loans held for investment and a 54 basis point or 60.0% decline in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities as we worked to lower our cost of deposits across all categories. The loan balance increase is primarily attributable to a combination of the FCB and BOW acquisitions and expansions into new markets. Fee income associated with PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns also contributed to net interest income. PPP fees recognized as income totaled $7.2 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020, respectively. 34 Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 also benefited from a 67.9% increase in average securities offset by a 59 basis point or 24.8% decrease in average security yield as yields on investments purchased were depressed by a sharp decline in market interest rates as the Federal Reserve lowered short-term rates to historically low levels in response to the pandemic. Provision for Loan losses Our policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets, or particular industry or borrower-specific conditions, which may materially and negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses. Provision expense is impacted by macroeconomic factors, the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of net charge-offs. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 1.03%, 1.10% and 1.23% at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our allowance for loan losses plus fair value purchase accounting marks to non-PPP loans was 1.13%, 1.27%, and 1.58% at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. 2022 compared to 2021 The year ended December 31, 2022 yielded a $2.5 million provision compared to a ($1.1) million release of loan loss reserves in 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in loans during the year ended December 31, 2022 and other qualitative factors offset by a release of pandemic-related reserves. Net charge-offs for 2022 were $0.4 million compared to $0.5 million for 2021, while our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment decreased from 1.10% at December 31, 2021 to 1.03% at December 31, 2022. Similarly, these decreases were attributable to an increase in loan balances during the year ended December 31, 2022 and a release of pandemic-related reserves offset by an increase in other qualitative factors. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. 2021 compared to 2020 The year ended December 31, 2021 yielded a ($1.1) million release of loan loss reserves compared to a $11.5 million provision in 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to improved asset quality trends, significant improvement in specific classified loans and improvement in COVID-19 qualitative factors within our allowance for loan losses methodology. While the pandemic and its variants are still considered within the Company's current allowance for loan losses, the release in 2021 is a reflection of credit quality metrics returning to pre-pandemic levels. Net charge-offs for 2021 were $0.5 million compared to $0.9 million for 2020, while our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment decreased from 1.23% at December 31, 2020 to 1.10% at December 31, 2021. Similarly, these decreases were attributable to improvements in economic conditions through December 31, 2021, as compared to the economic deterioration that occurred or was anticipated during 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and its variants. Noninterest Income In addition to net interest income, we generate recurring noninterest income. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges on deposit accounts, interchange and debit card transaction fees, originating and selling mortgage, commercial real estate and SBA loans, wealth management and gains (losses) on sales of securities. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, we own insurance on several key employees and record income within ""Other noninterest income"" based upon the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. 35 The following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated. 2022-2021 2021-2020 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2020 (Decrease) Noninterest income: Deposit service charges $ 4,781 $ 4,515 5.9 % $ 3,494 29.2 % Interchange and debit card transaction fees 5,053 4,816 4.9 % 3,172 51.8 % Mortgage banking 5,073 16,058 (68.4 )% 25,034 (35.9 )% Tri-Net 78 8,613 (99.1 )% 3,693 133.2 % Wealth management 1,687 1,850 (8.8 )% 1,573 17.6 % SBA lending 2,501 2,060 21.4 % 1,440 43.1 % Net gain on sale of securities 8 28 (71.4 )% 125 (77.6 )% Bank owned life insurance 2,996 1,829 63.8 % 887 106.2 % Other noninterest income 2,345 2,912 (19.5 )% 3,830 (24.0 )% Total noninterest income $ 24,522 $ 42,681 (42.5 )% $ 43,248 (1.3 )% 2022 compared to 2021 A decrease in mortgage banking and Tri-Net income drove a decrease in total noninterest income of $18.2 million to $24.5 million, or 17.8% of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $42.7 million, or 30.3% of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Mortgage banking income consists of mortgage fee income from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from period to period as the rate environment changes. Mortgage banking income decreased 68.4% from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to the Federal Reserve rate increases over 2022, and corresponding increases in mortgage rates, resulting in fewer lending transactions. Revenue for Tri-Net, a business launched in the fourth quarter of 2016, is derived from the origination and sale of commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All such sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Income from Tri-Net sales decreased significantly compared to the prior year primarily due to the adverse impact of rapidly rising interest rates on pricing and investor demand. As a result of this impact, the Company transferred $105.5 million of Tri-Net loans from loans held for sale to loans held for investment. Tri-Net results include a $1.3 million realized loss on sale of loans and a $2.4 million unrealized loss on loans transferred to held for investment, partially offset by a $1.6 million gain on related hedge instruments. Similar to the Company's mortgage division, the Company anticipates continued near-term challenges in the Tri-Net division in a volatile rate environment. The Company paused any further commitments to originate such loans early in the third quarter, noting that originations would restart only when clear indications of market stabilization and liquidity normalization are observed. The Company announced plans to test a limited pool of Tri-Net originations in the 1st half of 2023. SBA loan sales revenue also increased $0.4 million, or 21.4%, when compared to the prior year due to increased volumes and premiums as we continue to invest in and grow our government guaranteed lending division. As announced in the first quarter of 2023, we have hired a team of experienced SBA professionals to expand our SBA division and expect increased activity into 2023. Income on bank owned life insurance increased $1.2 million, or 63.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to the gain on death benefits. Other noninterest income primarily consists of loan related fees and other service-related fees. 36 2021 compared to 2020 The increase in interchange and debit card transaction fees and other deposit service charges for 2021 were driven by the incremental increase in transaction volume related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW, an emphasis on electronic banking and continued growth in deposits and volume of our commercial and consumer deposit account. Mortgage banking income decreased 35.9% from 2020 to 2021. In 2020, we experienced an increase in mortgage lending transactions as a result of the sharp decline in mortgage interest rates at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, volumes declined in 2021 as mortgage interest rates began to rise from 2020 levels. Revenue for Tri-Net increased through continued growth and development as one the Company's key unique fee businesses. SBA loan sales revenue also increased when compared to the prior year comparable period due to increased volumes and premiums as we continue to invest in and grow our government guaranteed lending division. Noninterest Expense The following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated. 2022-2021 2021-2020 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2020 (Decrease) Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits $ 38,065 $ 41,758 (8.8 )% $ 45,252 (7.7 )% Data processing and software 11,152 11,248 (0.9 )% 8,865 26.9 % Occupancy 4,299 4,205 2.2 % 3,590 17.1 % Equipment 2,988 3,507 (14.8 )% 3,195 9.8 % Professional services 2,175 2,155 0.9 % 2,224 (3.1 )% Regulatory fees 1,080 1,031 4.8 % 1,261 (18.2 )% Acquisition related expenses — 323 (100.0 )% 5,390 (94.0 )% Amortization of intangibles 1,690 1,939 (12.8 )% 1,824 6.3 % Other noninterest expense 7,921 7,375 7.4 % 5,760 28.0 % Total noninterest expense $ 69,370 $ 73,541 (5.7 )% $ 77,361 (4.9 )% 2022 compared to 2021 Total noninterest expense for 2022 decreased $4.2 million, or 5.7%, to $69.4 million compared to $73.5 million for 2021 primarily due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $3.7 million, or 8.8%. While our base employee count stayed consistent at 397, our incentive compensation decreased in 2022 in relation to net income, Tri-Net activity, and mortgage banking activities. Additionally, in 2022, our executives elected to voluntarily forego their annual bonuses which totaled $0.9 million in an effort to establish a culture of operational excellence following two operational losses and losses in the Company's Tri-Net division. Other noninterest expense in 2022 includes $1.5 million in operational losses for which the bank is seeking recovery. Our efficiency ratio was 57.51% and 54.94% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income and measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. When the efficiency ratio is adjusted for the Tri-Net losses, operational losses net of recoveries, and reversal of executive incentives the efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 56.13%. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. 37 2021 compared to 2020 Despite the impact of the FCB and BOW acquisitions, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation as mortgage banking results declined compared to 2020, as well as a decrease in severance expense. At December 31, 2021, our associate base increased to 397 employees compared to 380 at December 31, 2020. Data processing and software expense increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth, a full year of our FCB and BOW operations and services related to the processing of PPP loans. Our acquisition-related expenses decreased $5.1 million from 2020 to 2021 following the 2020 FCB and BOW acquisitions, and thereby, lower integration-related expenses. Our efficiency ratio was 54.94% and 67.40% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The improvement in efficiency ratio for 2021 is primarily attributable to greater expense discipline in accordance with the Company's core strategy. Income Taxes 2022 compared to 2021 We recorded income tax expense of $9.8 million and $12.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2022 and 2021 was 20.0% and 20.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to our investments in qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. The lower effective tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 is mainly the result of higher income on bank owned life insurance contracts and an increase in Tennessee state tax credits offset by fewer adjustments related to excess stock compensation expense. 2021 compared to 2020 We recorded income tax expense of $12.7 million and $6.0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 20.7% and 19.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to our investments in qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. The higher effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 is mainly the result of net operating loss carryback provisions associated with the CARES Act in 2020. Financial Condition 2022 compared to 2021 Total assets decreased from $3,133.0 million at December 31, 2021 to $3,117.2 million at December 31, 2022. Loans held for investment grew from $1,965.8 million at December 31, 2021 to $2,312.8 million at December 31, 2022, a 17.7% increase. The increase was supported by organic loan growth as well as transfers of loans from held for sale. Loans held for sale decreased $39.0 million or 46.6%, during 2022 which is primarily related to the pausing of Tri-Net originations and declines in mortgage banking volumes. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $279.8 million or 67.4% as the Company deployed its excess liquidity experienced in 2021 to fund loan originations, the repurchase of common stock, and dividends in 2022. 38 Total liabilities increased from $2,753.0 million at December 31, 2021 to $2,763.0 million at December 31, 2022. Deposits decreased $4.5 million to $2,679.8 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $2,684.2 billion at December 31, 2021. While in the short-term the Company is experiencing a period of increased competition for deposits driven by high interest rates, a key longer-term strategic initiative is to create a stronger deposit-led culture with an emphasis on lower cost relationship-based deposits. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s lowest cost deposit category, noninterest bearing, decreased $213.1 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, while higher cost time deposits increased $335.6 million or 90.0%. Other changes in deposits from 2021 to 2022 included a $194.7 million decrease or 20.6% in interest-bearing transaction deposits and a $67.7 million or 10.6% increase in savings and money market accounts. 2021 compared to 2020 Total assets increased $146.0 million or 4.9%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Loans held for investment grew from $1,883.7 million at December 31, 2020 to $1,965.8 million at December 31, 2021, a 4.4% increase. The increase was supported by organic loan growth partially offset by approximately $159.5 million in net paydowns of forgiven PPP loans. Loans held for sale decreased $103.3 million or 55.2%, during 2021 which is primarily related to the timing of selling residential and commercial real estate loans. Cash and cash equivalents increased $137.7 million or 49.6% as the Company continued to experience excess liquidity and grow deposits. Total liabilities increased $109.4 million or 4.1% from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Deposits increased $116.3 million to $2.684 billion at December 31, 2021, a 4.5% increase. While in the short-term the Company is experiencing a period of excess liquidity, a key longer-term strategic initiative is to create a stronger deposit-led culture with an emphasis on lower cost relationship-based deposits. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s lowest cost deposit category, noninterest bearing, increased $62.2 million December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, while higher cost time deposits decreased $96.5 million or 20.5%. Other changes in deposits from 2020 to 2021 included a $100.5 million increase or 11.9% in interest-bearing transaction deposits and a $50.0 million or 8.5% increase in savings and money market accounts. Investment Securities The investment portfolio plays a key role in the management of liquidity and interest rate risk and provides another source of interest income. In managing the composition of the balance sheet, we seek a balance between earnings sources and credit and liquidity considerations. We manage our investment portfolio according to a written investment policy approved by our board of directors. Balances in our investment portfolio are subject to change over time based on our funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of funds and are maintained at levels we believe are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, agency mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, asset-backed securities and other debt securities, all with varying contractual maturities. However, these maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as some of these securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. The investment portfolio is regularly reviewed by the Asset Liability Management committee, or ALCO, of the bank to ensure an appropriate risk and return profile as well as for adherence to the investment policy. 39 Our investment portfolio totaled $397.7 million, $461.2 million, and $488.6 million at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Decreases in our investment portfolio over 2022 are related to the unrealized losses experienced in response to the rising rate environment. See “Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our investment securities.

Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. The composition of gross loans and leases at December 31 for each of the past three years and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate - owner occupied $ 246,109 10.6 % $ 209,261 10.6 % $ 162,603 8.6 % Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied 803,611 34.7 % 616,023 31.3 % 481,229 25.5 % Consumer real estate 402,615 17.4 % 326,412 16.6 % 343,791 18.3 % Construction and land development 229,972 9.9 % 214,310 10.9 % 174,859 9.3 % Commercial and industrial 496,347 21.5 % 497,615 25.3 % 623,446 33.1 % Consumer 53,382 2.3 % 46,811 2.4 % 44,279 2.4 % Other 80,762 3.5 % 55,337 2.8 % 53,483 2.8 % Total gross loans held for investment $ 2,312,798 100.0 % $ 1,965,769 100.0 % $ 1,883,690 100.0 % 40 Over the past three years, we have continued to experience growth in our loan portfolio, especially in the commercial real estate loan classifications reflecting the development of the Target Market in which we operate along with our expansion into Chattanooga in 2021 and Asheville in 2022. Our primary focus has been on commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending, which constituted 67% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022. Although we expect continued growth with respect to our loan portfolio, we do not expect any significant changes over the foreseeable future in our emphasis on commercial lending. The repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes for our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. December 31, 2022 Due in 1 year or less Due in 1-5 years Due after 5-15 years Due after 15 years Total Commercial real estate $ 98,699 $ 526,417 $ 395,590 $ 29,014 $ 1,049,720 Consumer real estate 15,837 93,867 214,429 78,482 402,615 Construction and land development 60,450 134,413 24,258 10,851 229,972 Commercial and industrial 150,788 198,933 122,687 23,939 496,347 Consumer 13,018 34,437 5,898 29 53,382 Other 17,775 29,666 32,677 644 80,762 Gross loans $ 356,567 $ 1,017,733 $ 795,539 $ 142,959 $ 2,312,798 Interest rate sensitivity Fixed interest rates 114,963 750,096 500,589 12,308 1,377,956 Floating or adjustable interest rates 241,604 267,637 294,950 130,651 934,842 Total gross loans $ 356,567 $ 1,017,733 $ 795,539 $ 142,959 $ 2,312,798 The information presented in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be renewed at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio. Asset Quality One of our key objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality in our loan portfolio. We utilize disciplined and thorough underwriting processes that collaboratively engage our seasoned and experienced business bankers and credit underwriters in the analysis of each loan request. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ scaled review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our Chief Credit Policy Officer, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. In addition, we have adopted underwriting guidelines to be followed by our lending officers that require senior management review of proposed extensions of credit exceeding certain thresholds. When delinquencies exist, we monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. Our loan review procedures include approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors of our bank, an independent loan review, approval of larger credit relationships by our bank’s Credit Committee and loan quality documentation procedures. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to the risk that our loan portfolio will be subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. We target small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of such businesses and other consumers and high net worth individuals as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive or economic pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We use an independent consulting firm to review our loans for quality in addition to the reviews that may be conducted internally and by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process. Our bank has procedures and processes in place intended to assess whether losses exceed the potential amounts documented in our bank’s impairment analyses and to reduce potential losses in the remaining performing loans within our loan portfolio. These procedures and processes include the following: 41 Our bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Our bank analyzes loans individually by classifying each loan as to credit risk. This analysis includes all commercial loans and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000, individually. This analysis is performed on a regular basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least an annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the risk rating of each loan in the sample. See “Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for a table that provides the risk category of loans by applicable class of loans. Non-Performing Loans and Assets Information summarizing non-performing assets, including non-accrual loans follows. December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Non-accrual loans $ 10,714 $ 3,258 $ 4,817 Troubled debt restructurings 344 1,832 1,928 Loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing 1,025 1,380 3,296 Non-performing loans 10,714 3,258 4,817 Foreclosed real estate — 266 523 Non-performing assets $ 10,714 $ 3,524 $ 5,340 Non-accrual loans as a percentage of total loans 0.46 % 0.17 % 0.25 % Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.34 % 0.11 % 0.18 % Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans 222.20 % 665.99 % 482.56 % Non-accrual loans to total loans increased to 0.46% at December 31, 2022 compared to 0.17% at December 31, 2022. The increase in non-accrual loans is principally related to two relationships that total $8.4 million. These loans are made up of one loan totaling $3.4 million which has a 90% SBA guaranty of $3.0 million and a specific reserve of $0.3 million as well as a relationship of $5.0 million which is adequately secured with no loss expected. We have established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on loans (that is, place the loans on non-accrual status) after they have become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loans are considered to be well-collateralized and are in the process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In addition, a loan will not be placed on non-accrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of all principal and interest is not expected in a timely manner. Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against interest income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. If we believe that a loan will not be collected in full, we will increase the allowance for loan losses to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied directly to principal. As of December 31, 2022, there were not any loans, outside of those included in the table above, that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with present repayment terms. Due to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. The effect of these changes is assessed to determine if the loan should be classified as a Troubled Debt Restructure. Loans that have been restructured that are on non-accruing status as of the date of restructuring, are included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and are classified as impaired loans. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired. 42 Allowance for Loan Losses (allowance) Our allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above and in Notes 1 and 4 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” While no portion of our allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following tables represent management’s allocation of our allowance to specific loan categories for the periods indicated. December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate $ 7,934 33.3 % $ 7,124 32.8 % $ 7,349 31.6 % Consumer real estate 3,153 13.2 % 2,412 11.1 % 1,831 7.9 % Construction and land development 3,830 16.1 % 3,769 17.4 % 3,476 15.0 % Commercial and industrial 7,654 32.2 % 7,441 34.3 % 9,708 41.8 % Consumer 430 1.8 % 397 1.8 % 305 1.3 % Other 805 3.4 % 555 2.6 % 576 2.5 % Total allowance for loan and lease losses $ 23,806 100.0 % $ 21,698 100.0 % $ 23,245 100.0 % December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Average Loans Ratio Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Average Loans Ratio Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Average Loans Ratio Commercial real estate $ 213 $ 978,074 0.02 % $ — $ 727,102 0.00 % $ 10 $ 597,175 0.00 % Consumer real estate (2 ) 358,201 (0.00 )% 17 331,274 0.01 % (35 ) 296,610 (0.01 )% Construction and land development — 208,385 0.00 % — 196,098 0.00 % — 150,038 0.00 % Commercial and industrial (172 ) 501,132 (0.03 )% (189 ) 552,561 (0.03 )% (493 ) 555,024 (0.09 )% Consumer (220 ) 50,945 (0.43 )% (123 ) 45,263 (0.27 )% (96 ) 35,630 (0.27 )% Other (185 ) 79,336 (0.23 )% (186 ) 57,817 (0.32 )% (224 ) 55,702 (0.40 )% Total allowance for loan and lease losses $ (366 ) $ 2,176,073 (0.02 )% $ (481 ) $ 1,910,115 (0.03 )% $ (838 ) $ 1,690,179 (0.05 )% Changes in the allocation of the allowance from year to year in various categories are influenced by the level of net charge-offs in respective categories and other factors including, but not limited to, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and trends, risk allocations tied to specific loans or groups of loans and changes in qualitative allocations. Management believes that allocations for each loan category are reasonable and reflective of risk inherent in the portfolio. Deposits Client deposits are the primary funding source for our loan growth. The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on deposits for each of the following categories for the periods indicated. Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Types of Deposits: Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 676,617 0.00 % $ 725,075 0.00 % $ 558,416 0.00 % Interest-bearing transaction accounts 856,344 0.52 % 955,553 0.17 % 744,144 0.52 % Money market accounts 524,661 0.93 % 451,947 0.23 % 463,183 1.10 % Savings accounts 165,164 0.13 % 142,705 0.11 % 86,350 0.11 % Time deposits 450,005 1.20 % 417,770 0.69 % 407,224 1.31 % Total deposits $ 2,672,791 0.56 % $ 2,693,050 0.21 % $ 2,259,317 0.64 % Total average deposits remained relatively stable in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased 19.2% in 2021 compared to 2020. Increased pricing pressure during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted in a shift to higher cost deposit 43 categories during the year but the Company continues to focus on building and expanding client relationships to deliver on our core deposit-led strategy. The maturities of time deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250 thousand at December 31, 2022 are as follows ($ in thousands): December 31, 2022 Three months or less Over three through six months Over six through twelve months Over twelve months Total Time deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit $ 181,317 $ 102,306 $ 85,864 $ 10,401 $ 379,888 Capital Adequacy As of December 31, 2022, CapStar Financial’s capital ratios were as follows. Well Capitalized Guidelines December 31, 2022 Total risk-based capital 10.00% 14.51% Tier 1 risk-based capital 8.00% 12.61% Common equity tier 1 capital 6.50% 12.61% Tier 1 leverage 5.00% 11.40% See Note 16 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to our capital position. Market and Liquidity Risk Management Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of our established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our ALCO is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure an acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. Interest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis Managing interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity while attempting to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer requirements. We use earnings at risk, or EAR, simulations to assess the impact of changing rates on earnings under a variety of scenarios and time horizons. The simulation model is designed to reflect the dynamics of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments. These simulations utilize both instantaneous and parallel changes in the level of interest rates, as well as gradual and non-parallel changes such as changing slopes and twists of the yield curve. Static simulation models are based on current exposures and assume a constant balance sheet with no growth. By estimating the effects of interest rate increases and decreases, the model can reveal approximate interest rate risk exposure. The simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in interest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and does not indicate actual expected results. At December 31, 2022, our net interest income over the next year is estimated to be fairly neutral at a 100 basis point market rate increase while being adversely impacted by falling interest rates or by larger rate increases. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity, and key rate drivers. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may, and most likely will, differ from our static EAR results. In addition, static EAR results do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client behavior. For example, as part of our asset/liability management strategy, management has the ability to increase asset duration and/or decrease liability duration in order to reduce asset sensitivity, or to decrease asset duration and/or increase liability duration in order to increase asset sensitivity. 44 The following table illustrates our model's estimates of net interest income changes over the next 12 months in response to market interest rate changes. Net interest income change Increase 200bp (1.3)% Increase 100bp 0.1 Decrease 100bp (2.7) Decrease 200bp (6.6) Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. Management has established a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is fully integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; appropriate strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems (including assessments of the current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are commensurate with the complexity and business activities of the Bank; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; adequate levels of highly liquid marketable securities free of legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that can be used to meet liquidity needs in stressful situations; comprehensive contingency funding plans that sufficiently address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes sufficient to determine the adequacy of the institution’s liquidity risk management process. The role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors’ withdrawal and borrowers’ credit demands while at the same time optimizing financial results within our corporate guidelines. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of those funds. Liquidity is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, investment securities available-for-sale, various lines of credit available to us, and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally deposits. Our most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, available-for-sale marketable investment securities and federal funds sold. The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was $396.4 million at December 31, 2022. We pledge portions of our investment securities portfolio to secure public fund deposits, derivative positions and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. At December 31, 2022, total investment securities pledged for these purposes comprised 55% of the estimated fair value of the entire investment portfolio, leaving $180.4 million of unpledged securities. We have a large base of non-maturity customer deposits, defined as demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts. At December 31, 2022, such deposits totaled $2.0 billion and represented 74% of our total deposits. Other sources of funds available to meet daily needs include FHLB advances. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, the Company has access to credit products offered by the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, available credit from the FHLB totaled $509.4 million. Additionally, we had available credit from the Federal Reserve of $322.6 million and available federal funds purchased lines with correspondent banks totaling $145.0 million at December 31, 2022. The principal source of cash for CapStar Financial is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was able to pay up to $89.9 million in dividends to CapStar Financial without regulatory approval subject to the ongoing capital requirements of the Bank. Accordingly, management believes that our funding sources are at sufficient levels to satisfy our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 45 Contractual Obligations The following provides an overview of the Company's significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022. Short-term borrowings and long-term debt - The Company issued $30.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes during the third quarter of 2020, which were recorded net of issuance costs of $0.6 million, that mature June 30, 2030. Beginning on or after June 30, 2025, the Company may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The carrying value of subordinated notes was $29.7 million at December 31, 2022. The Company had FHLB advances of $15.0 million which matured in January of 2023. Operating Lease Obligations - We are party to operating lease agreements for many of our branch locations, ATMs, loan production offices and operation centers. For qualifying leases with a term exceeding one year we record a lease liability and right-of-use (""ROU"") asset on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the lease liability and ROU asset totaled $11.0 million and $10.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 the remaining terms of our leases ranged from one to 9 years. Certain of our leases contain options to renew the lease at the end of the current term. Unless we have determined we are reasonably likely to renew the lease, these options have been excluded from the calculation of our lease liability and ROU asset. Additional information regarding operating leases is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our clients. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit as well as commitments to extend credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold. We enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon clients maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. In the event that the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the client. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. We minimize our exposure to loss under loan commitments and standby letters of credit by subjecting them to the same credit approval and monitoring procedures as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses. The effect on our revenue, expenses, cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated. Contract or notional amount December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 1,112,950 $ 831,075 $ 804,520 Standby letters of credit 7,288 10,623 10,403 Total $ 1,120,238 $ 841,698 $ 814,923 46 Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Report includes the following financial measures that have been prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“non-GAAP financial measures”): tangible common equity, tangible book value per share of common stock, tangible book value per share of common stock plus after-tax unrealized available for sale investment (gains) losses, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common equity to tangible assets plus after-tax unrealized available for sale investment (gains) losses, the allowance for loan losses plus fair value purchase accounting marks to non-PPP loans, and the efficiency ratio excluding Tri-Net losses, operational losses, and executive incentive reversal. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enable a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business, and (iii) allow investors to evaluate the Company’s performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators; however, the Company acknowledges that its non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use.

Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. ITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 3, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Loan Losses As described in Note 4 to the Company’s financial statements, the Company has a gross loan portfolio of approximately $2.31 billion and related allowance for loan losses of approximately $23.8 million as of December 31, 2022. As described by the Company in Note 1, the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis and is based upon the Company’s review of the collectability of the loans in light of peer group historical loss experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. 51 We identified the Company’s estimate of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company’s judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions by the Company involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: We have served as the Company's auditor since 2017. /s/ Elliott Davis, LLC Franklin, Tennessee March 3, 2023 52 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary's (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 of the Company and our report dated March 3, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Elliott Davis, LLC Franklin, Tennessee March 3, 2023 53 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOL DINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Consolidated B alance Sheets (Dollars in

Statements NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 include CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and it’s wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank (the “Bank”, together referred to as the “Company”). Significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Under this method, all identifiable assets acquired, including purchased loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The Company typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of shares of common stock issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition. Nature of Operations Through the Bank, the Company provides full banking services to consumer and corporate customers located primarily in Tennessee. The Bank operates under a state bank charter and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a state member bank, the Bank is subject to regulations of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Reclassifications Certain amounts, previously reported, have been reclassified to state all periods on a comparable basis and had no effect on shareholders' equity or net income. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, determination of impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, the valuation of our investment portfolio, the valuation of loans held for sale, and deferred tax assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds are purchased and sold for one-day periods. The Company maintains deposits in excess of the federal insurance amounts with other financial institutions. Management makes deposits only with financial institutions it considers to be financially sound. 59 Securities The Bank accounts for securities under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities . Under the provisions of FASB ASC 320, securities are to be classified in three categories and accounted for as follows: Securities Held-to-Maturity - Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity securities when the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Trading Securities - Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. No securities have been classified as trading securities. Securities Available-for-Sale - Debt securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities. Securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Realized gains and losses from the sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific-identification method. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and any collateral underlying the relevant security. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: (1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and (2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. 60 Loans Held For Sale and Fair Value Option The Company classifies loans as loans held for sale when originated with the intent to sell. As of April 1, 2019, the Company elected the fair value option for all residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. This election allows for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. The Company has not elected the fair value option for other loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using derivative instruments. The fair value of residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell is based on traded market prices of similar assets. Other loans held for sale, such as SBA loans or Tri-Net loans, that are recorded at lower of cost or fair value may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when the fair value is less than cost. No SBA loans or Tri-Net loans were measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022. For further information, se e Note 22 - Fair Value. The Company does not securitize mortgage loans. If the Company sells loans with servicing rights retained, the carrying value of the mortgage loan sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. The changes in fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income and included gains (losses) of ($ 0.5 ) million, ($ 2.5 ) million, and $ 2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The following table summarizes the difference between the fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for residential real estate loans held for sale as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): Fair Value Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance Difference December 31, 2022 Residential mortgage loans held for sale $ 12,636 $ 12,582 $ 54 December 31, 2021 Residential mortgage loans held for sale 37,306 36,755 551 Tri-Net Fees Tri-Net fees are derived from the origination of commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Realized gains and losses are recognized when legal title of the loan has transferred to the investor and sales proceeds have been received and are reflected in the accompanying statements of income in Tri-Net fees, net of related costs such as commission expenses. Loans that have not been sold at period end are classified as held for sale on the balance sheet and recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. Loans The Company has seven classes of loans held for investment: commercial real estate, consumer real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, consumer, PPP, and other. The appropriate classification is determined based on the underlying collateral utilized to secure each loan. Commercial real estate includes both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties. The repayment of owner-occupied properties is largely dependent on the operations of the tenant, while non-owner occupied properties is dependent upon the refinance or sale of the underlying real estate. Consumer real estate consists primarily of 1-4 family residential properties including home equity lines of credit. Construction and land development loans include loans where the repayment is dependent on the successful completion and operation and/or sale of the related real estate project. Construction and land development loans include 1-4 family construction projects and commercial construction endeavors such as warehouses, apartments, office and retail space and land acquisition and development. Commercial and industrial loans include loans to business enterprises issued for commercial, industrial and/or other professional purposes. Consumer loans include all loans issued to individuals not included in the consumer real estate class. PPP loans originated through the CARES act and include partially, or fully forgivable loans used to cover payroll costs, rent, interest, utilities, and other qualifiable expenses. Other loans include all loans not included in the classes of loans above and leases. 61 Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful and collection is highly questionable. Amortization of deferred loan fees is discontinued when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on non-accrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Under the cash-basis method, interest income is recorded when the payment is received in cash. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Loans can also be returned to accrual status when they become well secured and in the process of collection. Acquired Loans Acquired loans are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on assumptions regarding the amount and timing of principal and interest payments, estimated prepayments, estimated default rates, estimated loss severity in the event of defaults, and current market rates. Estimated credit losses are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded on the acquisition date. An acquired loan is considered purchased credit impaired when there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually or aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics such as loan type and risk rating. The Company estimates the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan or pool, and the expected cash flows in excess of amount paid (fair value) is recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool (accretable yield). The excess of the loan’s or pool’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (nonaccretable difference). Over the life of the loan or pool, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded as a provision for loan losses. If the present value of expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income. Acquired non-impaired loans are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisioning that may be required. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is maintained at a level that management believes to be adequate to absorb expected loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Quarterly, the Company estimates the allowance required using peer group loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. The Company’s historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions due to the Company’s limited loss history. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. 62 The Company also considers the results of the external independent loan review when assessing the adequacy of the allowance and incorporates relevant loan review results in the loan impairment and overall adequacy of allowance determinations. Furthermore, regulatory agencies periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to record adjustments to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. Additional considerations are included in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance based on the continuous review conducted by relationship managers and credit department personnel. The Company’s loan policy requires that each customer relationship wherein total exposure exceeds $ 1.5 million be subject to a formal credit review at least annually. Should these reviews identify potential collection concerns, appropriate adjustments to the allowance may be made. The allowance consists of specific and general components as discussed below. While the allowance consists of separate components, these terms are primarily used to describe a process. Both portions of the allowance are available to provide for inherent losses in the entire portfolio. Specific Component The specific component relates to loans that are individually determined to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans meeting any of the following criteria are individually evaluated for impairment: risk rated substandard (as defined in Note 4), on non-accrual status or past due greater than 90 days. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral less costs to sell if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Changes to the valuation allowance are recorded as a component of the provision for loan losses. TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. TDRs are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s effective rate at inception. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. General Component The general component of the allowance for loan losses covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Large groups of homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. The general allowance component also includes loans that are individually identified for impairment evaluation but are not considered impaired. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. Due to the Company’s limited loss history, the historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions. The Company utilized a look-back period of 53 quarters , 49 quarters, and 45 quarters as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period was necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. This extension of the historical look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio. The actual loss experience is supplemented with other environmental factors that capture changes in trends, conditions, and other relevant factors that may cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from historical loss experience. The allocation for environmental factors is by nature subjective. These amounts represent estimated probable inherent credit losses, which exist but have not been captured in the historical loss experience. The 63 environmental factors include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans, quality of the loan review system, value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations, and other external factors. Servicing Rights When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in other noninterest income. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported with other noninterest income on the income statement and the associated asset is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement within other noninterest income, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income. Net servicing fees totaled $ 0.4 million , $ 0.6 million, and $ 0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Valuation adjustments associated with these servicing rights amounted to $ 47 thousand, $ 77 thousand and ($ 238 ) thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method based on the shorter of the asset lives or the expected lease terms. Useful lives for premises and equipment range from one to thirty-nine years . These assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)), which requires for all operating leases the recognition of a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For short term leases (term of 12 months or less), a lessee is permitted to make an accounting election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The lease cost will be allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. There were further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01, “Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842” in January 2018. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, ""Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements"", which provides for the option to apply the new leasing standard to all open leases as of the adoption date, on a prospective basis. Bank Owned Life Insurance The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Bank owned life insurance is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 64 Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase The Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase at a specified future date. Such repurchase agreements are considered financing arrangements and, accordingly, the obligation to repurchase assets sold is reflected as a liability in the balance sheets of the Bank. Repurchase agreements are collateralized by debt securities which are owned and under the control of the Bank and are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. Qualitative factors are assessed to first determine if it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, qualitative factors indicated it was more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill was less than fair value, thus there were no indicators of impairment and no quantitative testing was performed. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the balance sheet. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to ten years . Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned (“OREO”) includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and are recorded at estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Valuation adjustments required at foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, additional losses resulting from the periodic revaluation of the property are charged to other real estate expense. Costs of operating and maintaining the properties and any gains or losses recognized on disposition are also included in other real estate expense. Improvements made to properties are capitalized if the expenditures are expected to be recovered upon the sale of the properties. Restricted Equity Securities The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based upon the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on an assessment of the ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System, and as such, holds stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“Federal Reserve Bank”). Federal Reserve Bank stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Income Taxes Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company’s tax returns remain open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS and various states for the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2022. It is the Company’s 65 policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest, reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with performance vesting criteria, anticipated performance is projected to determine the number of awards expected to vest, and the corresponding aggregate expense is adjusted to reflect the elapsed portion of the performance period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $ 0.9 million, $ 0.8 million, $ 0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively and is included in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance-sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received. Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps (“swaps”) to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these arrangements to meet customer needs, the Bank enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize market risk to the Bank. These swaps are derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments. The Bank may also utilize cash flow hedges to manage its future interest rate exposure. These derivative contracts are designated as hedges and, as such, changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Bank prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges. The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness, along with support for management’s assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion, if any, would be recognized in current period earnings. The Bank discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended. When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as noninterest income. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. Cash flows resulting from the derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as hedges are classified in the cash flow statement in the same category as the cash flows of the items being hedged. 66 Commitments to fund mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market, “interest rate locks”, and forward commitments for the sale of mortgage-backed securities are accounted for as free standing derivatives. The fair value of the interest rate lock is recorded at the time the commitment to fund the mortgage loan is executed and is adjusted for the expected exercise of the commitment before the loan is funded. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest rate on the loan is locked. The Company enters into forward commitments for the sale of mortgage-backed securities when interest rate locks are entered into, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in mortgage banking income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on securities transferred to held to maturity and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges which are also recognized as separate components of equity. The Bank’s policy is to release the income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when the item is realized. Fair Value Measurements Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Restriction on Cash Balances Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Act requires that banks maintain reserve balances with their applicable Federal Reserve Bank based principally on the type and amount of their deposits. On March 15, 2020, the Board of the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020. This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions. Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure through March 3, 2023, w hich is the date the financial statements were available to be issued. 67 Income Per Common Share Basic net income per share available to common stockholders (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is attributable to convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of outstanding convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. No antidilutive stock options were excluded from calculation for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. The following is a summary of the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation for each of the following years (in thousands except share data): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Basic net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 39,017 $ 48,677 $ 24,696 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 22,010,462 22,127,919 20,162,038 Basic net income per share $ 1.77 $ 2.20 $ 1.22 Diluted net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 39,017 $ 48,677 $ 24,696 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 22,010,462 22,127,919 20,162,038 Dilutive shares contingently issuable 49,393 51,542 23,551 Average diluted common shares outstanding 22,059,855 22,179,461 20,185,589 Diluted net income per share $ 1.77 $ 2.19 $ 1.22 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic326) and related amendments In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities. The guidance requires an entity to utilize a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (""CECL"") model to estimate its lifetime ""expected credit losses"" and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial assets. Purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans will receive an initial allowance at the acquisition date that represents an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the loan, with no impact to earnings. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses prospectively, with such allowance limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. The CECL framework is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses and is expected to be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of the Company's loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which clarifies the scope of the credit losses standard and addresses issues related to accrued interest receivable balances and recoveries, among other things. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. The amendments provide entities with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis, upon adoption of Topic 326. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates . This update deferred the effective dates of Topic 326 to January 1, 2023 for certain entities including smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC. The Company, as a smaller reporting company as of the relevant measuring period, qualified for this extension. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in ASC 310-40, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings involving borrowings that are experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying the troubled debt restructuring recognition and measurement guidance, creditors will evaluate all loan modifications to determine if they result in a new loan or a continuation of the existing 68 loan. Losses associated with troubled debt restructurings should be incorporated in a creditor’s estimate of its allowance for credit losses. Additionally, public business entities are required to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for loan financing receivables and net investment in leases. The Company is currently finalizing its assessment of the adoption and ongoing impact, along with testing and finalization of internal controls relative to the adoption of CECL. At this time, the Company expects its allowance for credit losses related to all financial assets will increase in 2023 to approximately $ 24.5 to $ 26.0 million upon adoption compared to its allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2022 of approximately $ 24.1 million. Additionally, a reserve on unfunded commitments of $ 3.0 to $ 4.0 million will be established as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, a reserve that was previously not required. The Company will initially apply the impact of the new guidance through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption, which, for the Company, is January 1, 2023. Future adjustments to credit loss expectations will be recorded through the income statement as charges or credits to earnings. ASU 2020-04 ― Applicable to entities within the scope of Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform: In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The guidance was effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company continues to implement its transition plan towards cessation of LIBOR and the modification of its outstanding financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly influenced by LIBOR. The Company expects to utilize the LIBOR transition relief allowed under ASU 2020-04, as applicable, and does not expect such adoption to have a material impact on its accounting and disclosures. The Company will continue to assess the impact as the reference rate transition approaches June 30, 2023. 69 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 2 – ACQUISITIONS FCB Acquisition Effective July 1, 2020, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Acquisition dated as of January 23, 2020 (the “FCB Acquisition Agreement”), by and between the Company and FCB Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (“FCB”), FCB was acquired by CapStar, with CapStar continuing as the surviving entity (the “FCB Acquisition”).

The amount of the impairment of available for sale securities related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The unrealized losses shown above are primarily due to increases in market rates over the yields available at the time of purchase of the underlying securities and not credit quality. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022. There were no other-than-temporary impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020 . NOTE 4 – LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES Loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Commercial real estate $ 1,049,720 $ 825,284 Consumer real estate 402,615 326,412 Construction and land development 229,972 214,310 Commercial and industrial 496,347 497,615 Consumer 53,382 46,811 Other 80,762 55,337 Total 2,312,798 1,965,769 Allowance for loan losses ( 23,806 ) ( 21,698 ) Total loans, net $ 2,288,992 $ 1,944,071 Payroll Protection Program Loans The C ARES Act created a new guaranteed, unsecured loan program under the SBA called the Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”), which the Company participates in, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the pandemic period. The SBA has guaranteed 100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP by lenders to eligible small businesses. One of the notable features of the PPP is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if certain conditions are met related to retaining staff and if loan amounts are used to cover eligible expenses, such as payroll, mortgage interest, rents and utilities payments. These loans have a two-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1 %. The outstanding balances of loans originated under the PPP as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 total ed $ 0.2 milli on and $ 26.5 million, respectively, and were included in commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, PPP borrowers are not required to pay any fees to the government or the lender and the loans may be repaid by the borrower at any time. The SBA, however, will pay lenders a processing fee based on the size of the PPP loan, ranging from 1 % to 5 % of the loan. These fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan. PPP fees recognized as income tot aled $ 0.7 million, $ 7.2 milli on, and $ 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Loans Held for Sale Included within the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 the Company had $ 44.7 million in loans held for sale, which was comprised o f $ 12.6 million in residential mortgage loans and $ 32.1 million in the guaranteed portion of SBA loans. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 83.7 million in loans held for sale, which was comprised of $ 40.9 million in Tri-Net commercial real estate loans, $ 37.3 million in residential mortgage loans, and $ 7.4 million in the guaranteed portion of SBA loans. 74 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Allowance for Loan Losses The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is assessed at the end of each quarter. The ALL includes a specific component related to loans that are individually evaluated for impairment and a general component related to loans that are segregated into homogenous pools and collectively evaluated for impairment. The ALL factors applied to these pools are an estimate of probable incurred losses based on management’s evaluation of historical net losses from loans with similar characteristics, which are adjusted by management to reflect current events, trends, and conditions. The adjustments include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans, quality of the loan review system, value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations, and other external factors. The Company’s evaluation of other external factors included consideration of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic (including the effects of COVID-19 variants) and the resulting impact on the Company’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022, which has been uncertain due to evolving conditions and unforeseen new variants. Such factors do not have material impact to our allowance as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $ 934.9 million and $ 1,377.9 million, respec tively. At December 31, 2021 , variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $ 881.1 million and $ 1,084.7 million, respectively. The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes all commercial loans, and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $ 500,000 , individually and assigns each loan a risk rating. This analysis is performed on a continual basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least an annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the loan’s risk rating. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention – A special mention asset possesses deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving of management’s attention. If uncorrected, such weaknesses or deficiencies may expose the Company to an increased risk of loss in the future. Substandard – A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. Doubtful – A doubtful asset has all weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is extremely high, but certain important and reasonable specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset exist, therefore, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. Impaired – A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.

The Company did no t allocate a specific allowance for those loans at December 31, 2022 or 2021 and there were no commitments to lend additional amounts. Loans accounted for as TDR include modifications from original terms such as those due to bankruptcy proceedings, certain modifications of amortization periods or extended suspension of principal payments due to customer financial difficulties. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company’s loan policy. Loans accounted for as TDR are individually evaluated for impairment. The following table presents loans by class modified as TDR that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands).

There were no TDR for which there was a payment default within the twelve months following the modification during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms. Acquired Loans On July 1, 2020, the Company acquired FCB and BOW (see Note 2 for more information). As a result of the acquisitions, the Company recorded loans with a fair value of $ 294.7 million. Of those loans, $ 33.6 million were considered to be purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are loans for which it is probable at the acquisition date that all contractually required payments will not be collected. The remaining loans are considered to be purchased non-impaired loans and their related fair value discount or premium is recognized as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of each loan.

Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. Qualitative factors are assessed to first determine if it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2022, qualitative factors indicated it was more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill was less than fair value, thus there were no indicators of impairment and no quantitative testing was performed. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the balance sheet. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to ten years .

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 0.8 million related to the permanent tax rate benefit of Net Operating Loss carrybacks as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act""). 87 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Significant items that gave rise to deferred taxes at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 5,525 $ 4,863 Net operating loss carryforward 317 422 Organization and preopening costs 56 158 Stock-based compensation 307 152 Acquired loans 673 769 Accrued contributions 336 297 Acquired deposits 95 214 Accrued compensation 1,001 2,670 Deferred loan fees 2,301 1,004 Unrealized loss on securities available for sale 18,285 1,161 Other 200 215 Deferred tax assets 29,096 11,925 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation 1,609 1,563 Goodwill 624 465 Partnership investments 826 96 Amortization of core deposit intangible 770 1,136 Other acquired assets 229 337 Other 409 353 Deferred tax liabilities 4,467 3,950 Net deferred tax asset $ 24,629 $ 7,975 At December 31, 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.5 million, which expire at various dates from 2030 to 2032 . Deferred tax assets are fully recognized because the benefits are more likely than not to be realized based on management's estimation of future taxable earnings. There were no significant unrecognized income tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax penalties. NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for instruments that are included in the balance sheet. The following table sets forth outstanding financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Contract or notional amount December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 1,112,950 $ 831,075 Standby letters of credit 7,288 10,623 Total $ 1,120,238 $ 841,698 The Company is party to litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from such litigation and claims as of December 31, 2022 , will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company. The Company was notified of a potential operational loss in the amount of $ 0.7 million during the third quarter of 2022 which was recorded in the quarter. However, as of December 31, 2022 the Company and its legal counsel believe it is more likely than not that the liability will not be payable. Therefore, based on new information since recording the loss, the Company deems this loss recovered and reversed any losses in 88 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the fourth quarter of 2022 previously booked and a loss contingency is not recorded in the Company's liabilities as of December 31, 2022. NOTE 15 – CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Substantially all of the Company’s loans, commitments, and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Company’s market areas. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4 to the financial statements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions aggregated $ 108.0 million and $ 358.8 million, respectively, in excess of insured limits of which $ 99.3 million and $ 305.7 million, respectively, were due from the Federal Reserve. NOTE 16 – REGULATORY MATTER S AND RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the Bank is also subject to the regulatory capital requirements of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory – and possibly additional discretionary – actions by regulators that could, in that event, have a material adverse effect on the institutions’ financial statements. The relevant regulations require the Company and the Bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting principles. The capital classifications of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by their regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Those qualitative judgments could also affect the capital status of the Company and the Bank and the amount of dividends the Company and the Bank may distribute. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. Banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, federal banking regulators have established five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company and the Bank were well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There have been no conditions or events subsequent to December 31, 2022 that management believes have changed the Company’s or the Bank’s category. 89 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table (dollars in thousands): Actual Minimum capital requirement (1) Minimum to be well-capitalized (2) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio At December 31, 2022: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 410,704 14.51 % $ 226,491 8.0 % N/A N/A CapStar Bank 402,453 14.22 226,407 8.0 283,009 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 356,913 12.61 169,868 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 378,328 13.37 169,805 6.0 226,407 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 356,913 12.61 127,401 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 361,828 12.79 127,354 4.5 183,956 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 356,913 11.40 125,202 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 378,328 12.10 125,089 4.0 156,361 5.0 At December 31, 2021: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 384,116 16.29 % $ 188,610 8.0 % N/A N/A CapStar Bank 370,919 15.74 188,471 8.0 235,589 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 332,567 14.11 141,458 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 348,902 14.81 141,354 6.0 188,471 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 332,567 14.11 106,093 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 332,402 14.11 106,015 4.5 153,133 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 332,567 10.69 124,437 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 348,902 11.23 124,246 4.0 155,308 5.0 (1) For the calendar year 2022, the Company was required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of Tier 1 common equity capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 2.5 % to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees. (2) For the Company to be well-capitalized, the Bank must be well-capitalized and the Company must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Under Tennessee banking law, the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions is limited to the current year’s net income, combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. The Bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that Company holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Based on these regulations, the Bank was eligible to pay $ 89.9 million and $ 82.5 million of dividends as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The Bank paid the Company $ 14.1 million of dividends during 2022. 90 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 17 – STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES On April 23, 2021, the shareholders of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. approved the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the ""Plan""), which replaced the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of stock-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance awards and restricted stock, to employees, directors and service providers that are subject to forfeiture until vesting conditions have been satisfied by the award recipient under the terms of the award. The Plan is intended to help align the interests of employees and our shareholders and reward our employees for improved Company performance. The Plan reserved 1,168,543 shares of stock for issuance of stock incentives. Stock incentives include both restricted stock and stock option grants. Total shares issuable under the plan were 1,118,225 at December 31, 2022. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, within salaries and employee benefits for employees, and within other noninterest expense for directors, in the consolidated statements of income as follows (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 1,355 $ 1,600 $ 1,223 Less: deferred tax benefit ( 354 ) ( 418 ) ( 320 ) Reduction of net income $ 1,001 $ 1,182 $ 903 91 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Stock Units We grant time-vested restricted stock units and performance stock units to certain key employees and directors under our stock award plan. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at the issue date. Awards vest ratably over a two or three-year vesting period depending on the specific award. Performance stock units vest based upon the attainment of certain performance metrics over a three-year cumulative performance period. Certain of these awards are eligible to receive dividend equivalent shares. The grant date fair value of these awards approximates the market value of the shares. For awards based upon the achievement of the performance goals, the awards are earned ratably from 0 % to 188 %. If the performance goals are met at the end of the performance period, the award is adjusted to reflect the Company’s three-year total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to a capital market peer group. This TSR modifier cannot cause the award to exceed the maximum of 188 %. The recipients have the right to vote and receive dividends but cannot sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber the restricted stock until the shares have vested. A summary of the changes in the Company’s nonvested stock awards for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 follows: Weighted Average Restricted Grant Date Shares Fair Value Year Ended December 31, 2022 Nonvested at beginning of period 177,020 $ 14.00 Granted 92,212 21.22 Vested ( 58,637 ) 16.34 Forfeited ( 40,169 ) 15.35 Nonvested at end of period 170,426 $ 16.76 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Nonvested at beginning of period 148,414 $ 14.39 Granted 143,591 14.84 Vested ( 91,763 ) 14.99 Forfeited ( 23,222 ) 14.52 Nonvested at end of period 177,020 $ 14.00 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Nonvested at beginning of period 84,697 $ 17.44 Granted 144,557 13.73 Vested ( 76,715 ) 16.50 Forfeited ( 4,125 ) 14.45 Nonvested at end of period 148,414 $ 14.39 As of December 31, 2022 , there was $ 1.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 1.0 million, $ 1.7 million and $ 1.0 million, respectively. Stock Options Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Option awards generally have a three year vesting period and a ten year contractual term. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on calculations performed by management using industry data. The expected term of options granted was calculated using the “simplified” method for plain vanilla options as permitted under authoritative literature. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 92 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The fair value of options when granted is determined using the following weighted average assumptions as of the grant date. There were no options granted during 2022, 2021, or 2020. A summary of the activity in stock options for years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Exercise Contractual Shares Price Term (years) Year Ended December 31, 2022 Outstanding at beginning of period 130,245 $ 11.96 Granted — — Exercised ( 5,800 ) 8.79 Forfeited or expired — — Outstanding at end of period 124,445 $ 12.11 4.0 Fully vested and expected to vest 124,445 $ 12.11 4.0 Exercisable at end of period 124,445 $ 12.11 4.0 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Outstanding at beginning of period 226,589 $ 11.73 Granted — — Exercised ( 96,344 ) 11.41 Forfeited or expired — — Outstanding at end of period 130,245 $ 11.96 4.9 Fully vested and expected to vest 130,245 $ 11.96 4.9 Exercisable at end of period 113,578 $ 11.54 4.5 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Outstanding at beginning of period 271,202 $ 11.22 Granted — — Exercised ( 24,613 ) 6.75 Forfeited or expired ( 20,000 ) 10.92 Outstanding at end of period 226,589 $ 11.73 3.9 Fully vested and expected to vest 226,589 $ 11.73 3.9 Exercisable at end of period 193,255 $ 11.19 3.1 Information related to stock options during 2022, 2021 and 2020 follows: 2022 2021 2020 Intrinsic value of options exercised $ 71,340 $ 821,174 $ 188,662 Cash received from option exercises 50,982 1,077,489 105,847 Tax benefit realized from option exercises 18,648 148,312 16,524 Weighted average fair value of options granted — — — As of December 31, 2022, all compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Plan has been recognized. NOTE 18– EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain senior executives with various expiration dates. Most of the contracts have an option for annual renewal by mutual agreement. The agreements specify that in certain terminating events the Company will be obligated to provide certain benefits and pay each of the senior executives severance based on their annual salaries. These terminating events include termination of employment without “Cause” (as defined in the agreements) or in certain other circumstances specified in the agreements. 93 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 19 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a Retirement Savings 401(k) Plan in which employees may participate. The Company has elected a safe harbor 401(k) plan and as such is required to make an annual contribution of 3 % of the employees’ salaries annually. An employee does not have to contribute to receive the employer contribution. In addition, the Company may make an additional discretionary contribution up to 6 % of the employees’ salaries annually. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company contrib uted $ 1.0 m illion, $ 1.0 million and $ 0.8 million respectively, to the 401(k) Plan. The Company also has a Health Reimbursement Plan in place to offset the cost of healthcare deductibles for employees. At the end of the year, up to one-half of the unused balance in the employee’s account will be available for the following year up to a maximum of the deductible for that employee. NOTE 20 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate swap agreements. Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges There were no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022, 2021 , or 2020. The company previously terminated an interest rate swap during 2019, which resulted in a termination fee of $ 1.5 million which continued to be amortized as the corresponding hedged items, consisting of LIBOR-based brokered deposits and FHLB borrowings, were expected to remain outstanding until the initial maturities of the terminated swaps. However, during the year ended December 31, 2020, it was determined that in light of the Company’s surplus liquidity position this funding was expected to be terminated at the next renewal date and thus the previously terminated interest rate swaps which had been designated as cash flow hedges were no longer deemed effective, therefore, remaining unrealized losses of $ 1.9 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income were recognized in net income. There are no unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. Other Interest Rate Swaps The Company also enters into swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these transactions the Company enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize market risk to the Company. A summary of the Company’s customer related interest rate swaps is as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Notional Estimated Notional Estimated amount fair value amount fair value Interest rate swap agreements: Pay fixed/receive variable swaps $ 35,641 $ ( 2,343 ) $ 54,055 $ ( 1,594 ) Pay variable/receive fixed swaps 35,641 2,343 54,055 1,594 Total $ 71,282 $ — $ 108,110 $ — Mortgage Banking Derivatives The Company enters into various derivative agreements with customers in the form of interest-rate lock commitments which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. The derivatives are valued using a model that utilizes market interest rates and other unobservable inputs. Changes in the fair value of these commitments due to fluctuations in interest rates that are to be originated to our loans held for sale portfolio are economically hedged through the use of forward sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities. The gains and losses arising from this derivative activity are reflected in current period earnings under mortgage banking income. Interest rate lock commitments are valued using a model with significant unobservable market parameters. Forward sale commitments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable. 94 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The net gains (losses) relating to mortgage banking derivative instruments included in mortgage banking income were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended For the year ended For the year ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments $ 690 $ ( 1,911 ) $ 1,959 Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments ( 187 ) 466 ( 478 ) Total $ 503 $ ( 1,445 ) $ 1,481 The amount and fair value of mortgage banking derivatives included in the consolidated balance sheets was as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Notional Estimated Notional Estimated amount fair value amount fair value Included in other assets: Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments $ 19,413 $ 6 $ 50,281 $ 696 Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments 12,500 27 — — Included in other liabilities: Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments $ — $ — $ 43,000 $ ( 160 ) NOTE 21 – RELATED PARTY The Company may enter into loan transactions with certain directors, executive officers, significant shareholders, and their affiliates. Such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Company, and did not, in the opinion of management, involve more than normal credit risk or present other unfavorable features. None of these loans were impaired at December 31, 2022 or 2021. Activity within these loans during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands): Total commitment Total funded commitment Year ended December 31, 2022 Beginning of period $ 10,577 $ 8,538 New commitments/draw downs 42,625 24,871 Repayments ( 439 ) ( 104 ) End of period $ 52,763 $ 33,305 Year ended December 31, 2021 Beginning of period $ 18,024 $ 9,782 New commitments/draw downs 1,314 2,896 Repayments ( 8,761 ) ( 4,140 ) End of period $ 10,577 $ 8,538 Deposits from directors, executive officers, significant shareholders and their affiliates at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 30.9 million and $ 40.8 million, respectively. 95 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 22 – FAIR VALUE Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2: Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Investment Securities : The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2), using matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded and values debt securities by relying on quoted prices for the specific securities and the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). See below for additional discussion of Level 3 valuation methodologies and significant inputs. The fair values of all securities are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Derivatives-Interest Rate Swaps : The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). The Company’s derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair values of all interest rate swaps are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Impaired Loans : The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the loan policy. 96 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Other Real Estate Owned : Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Appraisals may be adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and/or management’s expertise and knowledge of the collateral. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. The Company had no other real estate owned carried at fair value at December 31, 2022 or 2021. Loans Held For Sale : Loans held for sale are carried at either fair value, if elected, or the lower of cost or fair value on a pool-level basis. Origination fees and costs for loans held for sale recorded at lower of cost or market are capitalized in the basis of the loan and are included in the calculation of realized gains and losses upon sale. Origination fees and costs are recognized in earnings at the time of origination for loans held for sale that are recorded at fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other observable market data, such as outstanding commitments from third party investors (Level 2). Derivatives-Mortgage Loan Interest Rate Lock Commitments : Interest rate lock commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are recorded at fair value, determined as the amount that would be required to settle each derivative instrument at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is derived from the fair value of related mortgage loans, which is based on observable market data and includes the expected net future cash flows related to servicing of the loans. In estimating the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment, the Company assigns a probability to the interest rate lock commitment based on an expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded (a “pull through” rate). The expected pull through rates are applied to the fair value of the unclosed mortgage pipeline, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e., the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Changes to the fair value of interest rate lock commitments are recognized based on interest rate changes, changes in the probability that the commitment will be exercised, and the passage of time. Derivatives-Mortgage-Backed Securities Forward Sales Commitments : The Company utilizes mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments to hedge mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments. Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments are recorded at fair value based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable, resulting in a Level 2 fair value classification. . 97 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands): Fair value measurements at December 31, 2022 Quoted prices in active Significant markets for other Significant identical observable unobservable Carrying assets inputs inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Securities available-for-sale: U.S. government agency securities $ 12,902 $ — $ 12,902 $ — State and municipal securities 68,312 — 68,312 — Mortgage-backed securities 244,828 — 244,828 — Asset-backed securities 3,270 — 3,270 — Other debt securities 67,104 — 67,104 — Loans held for sale 12,636 — 12,636 — Derivative assets: Interest rate swaps - customer related 2,343 — 2,343 — Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments 6 — — 6 Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments 27 — 27 — Liabilities: Derivative liabilities: Derivative Liabilities - customer related ( 2,343 ) — ( 2,343 ) — Fair value measurements at December 31, 2021 Quoted prices in active Significant markets for other Significant identical observable unobservable Carrying assets inputs inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Securities available-for-sale: U.S. government agency securities $ 11,503 $ — $ 11,503 $ — State and municipal securities 82,560 — 82,560 — Mortgage-backed securities 293,607 — 293,607 — Asset-backed securities 3,339 — 3,339 — Other debt securities 68,387 — 68,387 — Loans held for sale 37,306 37,306 Derivatives: Derivative Liabilities - customer related 1,594 — 1,594 — Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments 696 — — 696 Liabilities: Derivatives: Derivative Liabilities - customer related ( 1,594 ) — ( 1,594 ) — Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments ( 160 ) — ( 160 ) — The table below presents a reconciliation of all assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): Mortgage Loan Interest Rate Lock Commitments 2022 2021 Balance of recurring Level 3 assets at January 1st $ 696 $ 2,607 Total gains or losses for the period: Included in mortgage banking income ( 690 ) ( 1,911 ) Balance of recurring Level 3 assets at December 31st $ 6 $ 696 98 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following table presents quantitative information about recurring Level 3 fair value measurements at December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands).

Federal funds sold clear on a daily basis. For this reason, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Loans held for sale include residential mortgage loans, the guaranteed portion of SBA loans, and Tri-Net loans. The fair value of residential mortgage and SBA loans held for sale is measured using an exit price notion. The fair value of Tri-Net loans held for sale is measured using an exit price notion in as much as observable market data is available. Where there is no observable market data, the fair value of Tri-Net loans held for sale is estimated using discounted cash flow models. There were no Tri-Net loans held for sale as of December 31, 2022. It is not practical to determine the fair value of restricted securities due to restrictions placed on their transferability. In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the fair value of loans is measured using an exit price notion. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models or based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value. 100 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Included in other assets are bank owned life insurance and certain interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. For bank owned life insurance, the carrying amount is based on the cash surrender value and is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated by discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates with similar remaining maturities. The fair value of fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and other borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates, advances and other borrowings with similar remaining maturities. Included in other liabilities are accrued interest payable and certain interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on estimating on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, fixed assets are not considered financial instruments and their value has not been incorporated into the fair value estimates. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates. 101 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 23 – PARENT COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following information presents the condensed balance sheets of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands).

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOU NTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022 management reported a material weakness over the design of internal control over financial reporting for our general ledger account balancing made up of the following deficiencies: Remediation of Material Weakness As of the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the material weakness described above has been remediated through the implementation of measures to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness have been remediated. Such measures include assigning each general ledger account an owner and second reviewer, implementing procedures for the Accounting Division to review and attest to each general ledger account, and ensuring our internal audit plans test the effectiveness of our general ledger account oversight. We consider the material weakness remediated as the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. There were no changes other than those described above in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting was designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway 104 Commission in 2013. Management also conducted an assessment of requirements pertaining to Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. This section relates to management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) and in compliance with laws and regulations. Our evaluation included a review of the documentation of controls, evaluations of the design of the internal control system and tests of the effectiveness of internal controls. Based on such assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Elliott Davis LLC, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

B USINESS OVERVIEW CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc., a Tennessee corporation, is a bank holding company that is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee and that operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, a Tennessee-chartered state bank. CapStar Bank was incorporated in the State of Tennessee in 2007 and acquired a state charter in 2008 which was accomplished through a de novo application with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (“TDFI”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Upon approval of its charter, CapStar Bank opened for business to the public on July 14, 2008. CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in 2015 and, on February 5, 2016, completed a share exchange with CapStar Bank’s shareholders that resulted in CapStar Bank becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We are a bank that seeks to establish and maintain comprehensive relationships with our clients by delivering customized and creative banking solutions and superior client service. Our products and services include (i) commercial and industrial loans to small and medium sized businesses, (ii) commercial real estate loans, (iii) Mortgage banking products and services, (iv) private banking and wealth management services for the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals; (v) correspondent banking services to meet the needs of Tennessee’s smaller community banks and (vi) various retail and consumer products. Our operations are presently concentrated in Tennessee. As of December 31, 2021, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $3.1 billion, total deposits of $2.7 billion, total net loans of $1.9 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $380.1 million. Core Operating Principles We operate our business in conformity with our core principles which are, in order of priority: We have historically adhered to these core operating principles, and we intend to continue to emphasize the importance of these principles to the conduct of our business. 1 Acquisitions and Expansion On October 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Athens Bancshares Corporation (“Athens”), the bank holding company for Athens Federal Community Bank, National Association (“Athens Federal”), headquartered in Athens, Tennessee. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Athens for approximately $92.9 million in total consideration which was primarily comprised of the issuance of approximately 5.2 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of the acquisition, Athens Federal had eight banking locations located throughout the Eastern Tennessee corridor between Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee. The operations of Athens are included in our financial statements beginning October 1, 2018. On July 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of FCB Corporation (“FCB”), the bank holding company for the First National Bank of Manchester. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of FCB for approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of acquisition, Manchester had four banking locations throughout middle Tennessee. The operations of Manchester are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020. On July 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of the Bank of Waynesboro (“BOW”). We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of BOW for approximately 0.7 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of acquisition, BOW had six banking locations throughout Southern Tennessee. The operations of BOW are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020. In addition to acquisitions, we seek opportunities to expand our presence organically when we identify a strong banking team in a market with attractive economic characteristics and market demographics where we believe we can achieve accelerated growth of loans and deposits while deploying capital in a disciplined manner. Prior to entering a new market, historically we have identified and built a team of experienced, successful bankers with market-specific knowledge to lead the bank’s operations in that market. Generally, we or members of our senior management team are familiar with these individuals based on prior work experience and reputation, and strongly believe in the ability of such individuals to successfully execute our business model. Ideal geographic areas for expansion include those with successful, experienced bankers with strong reputations in the market and economic attributes necessary to drive quality lending and deposit opportunities. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Company announced the hiring of a team of nine experienced financial professionals to grow market share and serve clients in Chattanooga, TN. Our Products and Services Loans General. Through our bank, we offer a broad range of commercial lending products to small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals. Our strategy is to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio in terms of the type of loan product, the type of client and the industries in which our business clients are engaged. Our commercial and industrial lending products include commercial loans, business term loans, equipment financing and lines of credit to a diversified mix of small and medium sized businesses. We offer commercial real estate loans that are collateralized by both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties, as well as interim construction loans. Our consumer lending products include residential first mortgage loans which are typically thereafter sold on the secondary market. We offer second mortgage home equity mortgage loans and other consumer related loans such as loans for automobile or other recreational vehicles, which we maintain on the Bank’s balance sheet. Additionally, we offer lines of credit to facilitate investment opportunities for consumer clients whose financial characteristics support the request. We market our lending products and services to existing clients through our client service. We seek to attract new lending clients through banking teams that are specifically dedicated to the markets in which we serve. We believe our industry-specific knowledge, product and local market expertise and engagement increase our profile within these lending verticals, enable us to identify, select and compete for qualified borrowers and attractive financing projects and manage more effectively the potential risks of our loan portfolio. Underwriting. Disciplined underwriting is the foundation of our credit culture. We strive to adhere to thorough underwriting standards and deliver customized and creative loan solutions in a responsive and timely manner. 2 Philosophically, we seek loans that are prudent and desirable, not just “doable.” In considering a loan, we follow the underwriting principles in our loan and credit administration policies which include the following requirements: Except in very limited circumstances in which substantial equity is present, our commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are supported by personal guaranties from the principals of the borrower. In addition, we require our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans to be secured by well- managed income producing property with adequate margins, supported by a history of profitable operations and cash flows, and proven operating stability. Our underwriting processes collaboratively engage our bankers and credit underwriters in the analysis of each loan request. We manage our credit risks by analyzing metrics in order to maintain a conservative and well-diversified loan portfolio reflective of our assessment of various subsets within our market. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ tiered review of loan originations that may involve joint line and credit authorization, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. Concentrations. We are a relationship-oriented, rather than a transaction-based, bank. Accordingly, substantially all of our loans have been made to borrowers located in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 73% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market, and a substantial portion of those loans are considered commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied and non-owner occupied real estate), mortgage loans and construction loans. As such, a substantial majority of our loan portfolio is dependent upon the economic environment of our Target Market. We do have a limited number of loans secured by properties located outside of Tennessee, most of which are made to borrowers who are well-known to us because they are headquartered or reside within Tennessee. In addition, we employ appropriate limits on our overall loan portfolio and requirements with respect to certain types of lending. As a general practice, we operate with an internal guideline limiting loans to any single borrowing relationship to a tiered amount based upon our internal risk rating. Many of our loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2021, our 25 largest borrowing relationships (which may include multiple loans to one borrower or loans to multiple entities that are affiliated due to common ownership) accounted for approximately 15% of our total loan portfolio. Credit Risk Management. Managing credit risk is a process that involves the entire Company. Our strategy for credit risk management includes the disciplined underwriting process described above, adherence to prudent standards, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all loan exposures. Our Chief Credit Policy Officer provides bank-wide credit oversight and regularly reviews the loan portfolio to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. We periodically submit ourselves to review by independent third parties to validate our internal oversight. We strive to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans become delinquent or impaired, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Credit risk management involves a partnership between our bankers and our credit department with credit approval processes requiring concurrence of the two. The members of our credit administration group primarily focus their efforts on credit analysis, underwriting and monitoring of credits and providing management reporting to executive management and our board of directors. Based upon size, emerging problem loans are assigned to our special assets process to mitigate the risk of loss. Executive management regularly reviews the status of the watch list and classified 3 assets portfolio as well as the larger credits in the portfolio. Our collections department is also responsible for managing the collection and foreclosure process and the disposal of other real estate owned. Deposits Core deposits are our principal source of funds for use in lending and other general banking purposes. We solicit core deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through relationship-focused marketing. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, time and savings deposits, certificates of deposit and CDARS ® reciprocal products. We do not rely on brokered deposits as a meaningful source of funding. Our ability to gather deposits is an important aspect of our business franchise, and we believe this is a significant driver of our success. Our largest sources of deposits are NOW, Demand Deposit Accounts, money market and savings accounts. Our transaction accounts include checking and NOW accounts, which provide us with a source of fee income, as well as a low-cost source of funds. Time accounts also provide us with a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. Certificates of deposit are held primarily by clients in our Target Market. Deposit rates are reviewed regularly by pricing committee as we continuously seek to price our deposit products and services to promote core deposit growth. Our management believes that the rates that we offer are competitive with those offered by other institutions in our Target Market. Correspondent Banking We provide correspondent banking services to community banks. Services we offer include settlement, Fed Funds lines of credit, depository products, wire transfer services, bank holding company loans and loan participations on larger commercial and commercial real estate exposures. Correspondent banking deposits comprised approximately $408.5 million or 15% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2021. Correspondent banking provides a valuable funding source for the bank. In 2013, management identified a void in the Tennessee correspondent banking market due to the instability of larger correspondent banks. Other factors leading to the expansion of correspondent banking included a need to diversify our funding base, the desire by many community banks to do business with a Tennessee-based correspondent bank, the ability to recruit well-known and respected talent for business development and risk management, and the ability to license a low cost proprietary settlement platform. Mortgage Banking Mortgage banking generated $0.9 billion in mortgage loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2021. Mortgage loans are typically sold in the secondary market and are underwritten by the bank. Mortgage banking has provided the bank a source of noninterest income and referrals for other banking services including home equity lines of credit and deposit products. Other Services Given client demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour telephone and online banking, direct deposit, mobile banking, safe deposit boxes, remote deposit and cash management services for individuals and small and medium sized business. We also participate in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers are able to use throughout Tennessee and other regions. In many cases, we reimburse our customer for any ATM fees that may be charged to the customer. Competition The financial services industry is highly competitive in our Target Market. In particular, the Target Market consisted of 84 financial institutions with over $114 billion in deposits as of June 30, 2021. We held the number 9 deposit market share position at June 30, 2021 with 2.5% of the deposit market share. We compete for loans, deposits, and financial services in our Target Market. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area, Internet-based banks, out-of-market banks, and bank holding companies that advertise in or otherwise serve our market area, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer 4 additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. Changes in regulation, technology and product delivery systems have resulted in an increasingly competitive environment. We expect to continue to face increasing competition from online and traditional financial institutions seeking to attract customers by providing access to similar services and products; however, we believe that our experienced leadership, efficient and scalable operating model, personalized service and emphasis on attracting core deposits from our other product offerings enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which we operate. Information and Technology We continually adapt to the changing technological needs and wants of our clients by investing in our electronic banking platform. We use a combination of online and mobile banking channels to attract and retain clients and expand the convenience of banking with us. In most cases, our clients can initiate banking transactions from the convenience of their personal computer or smart phone, reducing the number of in-branch visits necessary to conduct routine banking transactions. The remote transactions available to our clients include remote image deposit, bill payment, external and internal transfers, ACH origination and wire transfer. We believe that our investments in technology and innovation are consistent with our clients’ needs and will support future migration of our clients’ transactions to these and other developing electronic banking channels. Further, we closely monitor information security for trends and new threats, including cybersecurity risks, and invest significant resources to continuously improve the security and privacy of our systems and data. For more information, please see “– Supervision and Regulation - Cybersecurity and Privacy”. The Company also has an Information Technology (IT) Steering Committee comprised of internal managers representing various divisions of the Company. The Committee oversees IT strategic and investment priorities and the Company’s Information Security Program. The Committee regularly reports to the Risk Committee of the Board through distribution of meeting minutes and other presentations and communication, including a comprehensive overview of the Company’s cyber and information security program annually. Human Capital As of December 31, 2021, we had 397 total employees. As a service-oriented business, our long-term success depends on our people and we are committed to taking a multi-dimensional approach to talent and culture. Our people and culture are critical to the Company’s long-term success. As such, our talent vision and strategy focus on: Talent Vision, Strategy and Development Diversity, Equity and Inclusion- At CapStar, we cultivate and advance diversity in all forms as part of building a strong culture, a culture in which inclusion and belonging are paramount, and where all of our colleagues strive to be open and inclusive leaders and teammates. Our culture is what unifies our colleagues across our diverse business model, ensures we are best positioned to serve our diverse clients and propels our continuous evolution. We are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer and enforce those values throughout all of our operations. We prohibit discrimination in hiring or advancement against any individual on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sex, national origin, age, marital status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, genetics, veteran status, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. Oversight- Transparency and accountability are critical to driving our recruiting and development practices. We are committed to advancing the leadership of our Board through the inclusion of female and diverse directors, as detailed in the Company’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter. With more than 20% female representation, the Company was recognized nationally for its commitment to board diversity by the 2020 Women on Boards education and awareness campaign as one of only 52% of Russell 3000 companies earning the distinction. 5 We employ Gallup Engagement Surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and solicit feedback from team members on ways management can improve the working environment and development of team members. Management has specific goals developed through these surveys and is encouraged to constantly improve the work environment and team member satisfaction and retention. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. Environmental Matters The Company knows that we are responsible for protecting our planet and understands that reducing our business’s carbon footprint is key to a sustainable future. We are committed to measuring and minimizing our collective impact on the environment while contributing to environmental stewardship and responsible business operations. We have embedded environmental sustainability throughout our products, services, operations, and culture to drive efficiencies and responsible resource use while creating comfortable, safe, and healthy workplaces for our stakeholders. We do this by focusing on LED conversions and timely replacement of HVAC systems in our existing buildings and the installation of the most energy efficient alternatives in connection with new construction. Further, we mandate the recycling of shred waste as well as striving to optimize building occupancy to limit the adverse impact of unnecessary expansion. Additionally, we drive reductions in our carbon footprint through the utilization of technology and digital channels, including payments, credit, savings, remittances, online and mobile banking, and imaging systems. We also promote the use of electronic deposit account statements, loan, tax and other notices, and eSign technology, which support efficiency and paper reduction. We impact the environment through our operations and through the financing of the operations of other companies that could pose risks to the environment. CapStar works hard to ensure that our lending activities do not encourage business activities that could cause irreparable damage to our reputation or the environment. As a result, we try to conduct business responsibly and actively work with stakeholders to best serve our various constituents. In general, we evaluate each credit or transaction on its individual merits, with larger deals receiving more attention and deeper analysis. Our underwriting process regularly looks at governance issues and seeks to incorporate relevant industry risks. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance and that of our subsidiaries may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the TDFI, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitizations and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results and those of our bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of insured banks, their holding companies and affiliates that are intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and enter into acquisitions with other companies, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective primary federal regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance 6 with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and our bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. Bank Holding Company Regulation Since we own all of the capital stock of our bank, we are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Acquisition of Banks The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before: Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of the above transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources includes a focus on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section titled “Item 1. Business—Regulation and Supervision—Capital Adequacy.” The Federal Reserve also considers the effectiveness of the institutions in combating money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering program of the acquiring bank holding company and the anti-money laundering compliance records of a bank to be acquired as part of the transaction. Finally, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration the extent to which the proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Under the BHC Act, if well-capitalized and well-managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. In each case, however, state law may place restrictions on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for at least three years. Change in Bank Control Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute acquisition of “control” of the bank holding company if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the transaction or the bank holding company has registered securities under the Exchange Act. In addition, any person or group of persons acting in concert must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25% (or 5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, the right to 7 control in any manner the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the bank holding company. Permitted Activities Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities: Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include: The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. Support of Subsidiary Institutions The Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. As a result of a bank holding company’s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank. Repurchase or Redemption of Securities A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions. 8 Bank Regulation and Supervision Our bank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of the operations of our bank. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the safety and soundness of our bank and our bank’s depositors, rather than our shareholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to our bank. Since our bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the state of Tennessee and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI regularly examine our bank’s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Our bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. Our bank is also subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations. Branching Under current Tennessee law, our bank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of, or prior notice to, the TDFI and the Federal Reserve. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, our bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Tennessee. Under federal law, our bank may establish branch offices with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. While prior law imposed various limits on the ability of banks to establish new branches in states other than their home state, the Dodd-Frank Act allows a bank to branch into a new state by setting up a new branch if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. This makes it much simpler for banks to open de novo branches in other states. FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the assessment rate is determined by the risk category assigned to an institution based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations which are designed to measure risk, with riskier institutions paying a higher assessment rate. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC. In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions were required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a federal government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The final FICO assessment collection occurred in March 2019. Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our bank’s record of performance under the CRA is publicly available. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. As of December 31, 2021 the Bank had a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” Interest Rate Limitations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by our bank are subject to applicable state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. 9 Federal Laws Applicable to Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions Our bank’s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including: Capital Adequacy Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, under the adopted regulations, the Basel member central bank and federal bank regulators approved the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord, or Basel III. The U.S. Basel III rule’s minimum capital to risk-weighted assets, or RWA, requirements are as follows: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The rule also changed the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Basel III rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital. Under the U.S. Basel III rule, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016, and the requirements became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization maintaining capital levels in excess of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. A banking organization also would be prohibited from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework requires us to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios of (i) 7% for common equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5% total capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. With the capital conservation buffer fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action, or PCA, well-capitalized thresholds. 10 Generally, banking organizations of our size became subject to the U.S. Basel III rule on January 1, 2015, while the capital conservation buffer and the deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital phased in over time. Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a banking institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into which all insured depository institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds and other qualitative requirements for each of those categories. For an insured depository institution to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2021, our bank qualified for the “well capitalized” category. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new markets or product offerings, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with Federal Reserve approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. Liquidity Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. This scrutiny has increased during recent years, as the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s negatively affected the liquidity of many financial institutions. Various bank regulatory publications, including Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management) and FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-84-2008 (Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions. Any increased liquidity requirements applied to us or our bank generally would be expected to cause us or our bank to invest assets more conservatively—and therefore at lower yields—than we and our bank otherwise might invest. Such lower-yield investments likely would reduce our revenue stream, and in turn our earnings potential. 11 Payment of Dividends We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, is dividends our bank pays to us as our bank’s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to our bank’s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our shareholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Tennessee corporate law which prevents payment of dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our board of directors must consider our and our bank’s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs. The TDFI also regulates our bank’s dividend payments. Under Tennessee law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend without prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (i) the total of its retained net income for that year, plus (ii) its retained net income for the preceding two years. Our bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Our bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of the bank’s transactions with its affiliates. Subject to various exceptions, the total amount of the bank’s transactions with affiliates is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, transactions with affiliates also must meet specified collateral requirements and safety and soundness requirements. Our bank must also comply with provisions prohibiting the acquisition of low-quality assets from an affiliate. Our bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in transactions with affiliates, as well as other types of transactions set forth in Section 23B, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Our bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions between the bank and third parties, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There are also individual and aggregate limitations on loans to insiders and their related interests. The aggregate amount of insider loans generally cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus. Insiders and banks are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly entering into insider loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Single Borrower Credit Limits Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. 12 Commercial Real Estate Concentration In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.” Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2021, our bank’s total CRE loans represented 217% of total capital. Privacy Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting non-public personal information of their clients. Clients generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing non-public personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. Consumer Credit Reporting The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) imposes, among other things: Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation Our bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank has established an anti-money laundering program pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act and customer identification program pursuant to the USA Patriot Act. The bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. Our bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements. Overdraft Fees Federal Reserve Regulation E restricts banks’ abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. 13 The Dodd-Frank Act As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this new law has significantly changed and is significantly changing the bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on the rules and regulations that implement it. A number of the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this “Supervision and Regulation” section. The following items provide a brief description of certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and our bank. As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, we expect compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Volcker Rule On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted a final rule implementing the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits any “banking entity” from engaging in proprietary trading or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with covered funds (i.e., hedge funds or private equity funds). In addition, the Volcker Rule requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule. 14 On October 8, 2019, the agencies finalized revisions to the Volcker Rule that, among other things, simplified and streamlined compliance requirements for banking entities that do not have significant trading activities, while banking entities with significant trading activity would become subject to more stringent compliance requirements. Further, the revisions to the Volcker Rule implemented Section 203 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which amended the definition of “banking entity” to exclude certain community banks from the definition of insured depository institution, the general result of which was to exclude such banks and their affiliates and subsidiaries from the scope of the Volcker Rule. Under EGRRCPA, a community bank and its affiliates are generally excluded from the definition of “banking entity” if the bank and all companies that control the bank have total consolidated assets equal to $10 billion or less and trading assets and liabilities equal to five percent or less of total consolidated assets. These revisions became effective on January 1, 2020, with a required compliance date of January 1, 2021. Limitations on Incentive Compensation In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and our bank, the proposal imposes principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions are prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal also imposes certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. The Federal Reserve reserves the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. Cybersecurity and Privacy Cybersecurity is a high-priority item for legislators and regulators at the federal and state levels, as well as internationally. State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements and, in some cases, regulations, emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision. Such policy statements and regulations indicate that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. These requirements, including state regulatory rules such as the detailed and extensive cybersecurity rules issued in 2016 by the New York State Department of Financial Services, may cause us to incur significant additional compliance costs and in some cases may impact our growth prospects. Additionally, if we fail to observe federal or state regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. The Company has an Information Technology (IT) Steering Committee comprised of internal managers representing various divisions of the Company. The Committee oversees IT strategic and investment priorities and the Company’s Information Security Program. The Committee regularly reports to the Risk Committee of the Board through distribution of meeting minutes and other presentations and communication, including a comprehensive overview of the Company’s cyber and information security program annually. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We also employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, as attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume and complexity, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Financial expenditures may also be required to meet regulatory changes in the information security and cybersecurity domains. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks 15 are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See “Item 1A. – Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity. Federal statutes and regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, limit our ability to disclose non-public information about consumers, customers and employees to nonaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the GLBA requires us to disclose our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing non-public information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. The GLBA also requires us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and, if applicable state law is more protective of customer privacy than the GLBA, financial institutions, including our bank, will be required to comply with such state law. Other laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. Proposed or new legislation and regulations may also significantly increase our compliance cost and impede our ability to grow into specific markets. There are a number of proposals that have either recently been adopted or are currently pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. In addition, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) on June 28, 2018. Both the GDPR and the CCPA impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. In the event of a data breach, there are mandatory reporting requirements that may hamper the ability to fully assess an incident prior to external reporting. We must maintain awareness of additional legal and regulatory requirements that apply to existing and future subsets of the customer base for protection against legal, reputational, and financial risk due to compliance failures.

RI SK FACTORS We are subject to numerous risks, and the material risks that management believe affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations are described below. Many of these risks are beyond our control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing financial and operational results. You should carefully read and consider the following risks factors. The occurrence of any of the following risks, as well as risks of which we are currently unaware or currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. As a result, the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the following risks and other information in this Report or incorporated into this Report by reference, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” should be carefully considered before investing in shares of our common stock. Some statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Report. Risks Related To Our Business Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by global pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic and future variants. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been and may be adversely affected if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to interfere with the ability of our employees, vendors, customers, financing sources, or others to conduct business or continues to negatively affect consumer confidence or the economy. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. The United States declared a national emergency concerning the pandemic, and multiple states and municipalities have declared public health emergencies. Along with these declarations, there have been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions across the United States and the world, including quarantines and “stay-at-home” orders and similar mandates for many individuals to restrict daily activities substantially and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. Although some restrictions have eased in some jurisdictions, there have been increasing rates of COVID-19 infection in regions across the United States and the world in recent months, which have yet to show substantial signs of decline, and some areas are re-imposing closures and other restrictions due to such increasing rates of COVID-19 cases. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected, and is likely to continue to affect, overall economic conditions in the United States. Although the Company maintains contingency plans for pandemic outbreaks, a significant increase in COVID-19 cases above current levels could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct its business activities. Such an increase or outbreak could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for the Company. If COVID-19 spreads or the response to contain COVID-19 and its variants is unsuccessful, the Company could experience a material adverse effect to its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The pandemic is a widespread health crisis that has affected large segments of the global economy, resulting in a rapidly changing market and economic activities. The pandemic and any preventative or protective actions that governments, our customers or suppliers or we may take, in addition to those already in place, with respect to COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on our business, including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, or reduced consumer demand. Any additional financial impact cannot be estimated reasonably at this time but may materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to affect our results will depend on future developments, including whether there are additional outbreaks, mutations or related strains of the virus in locations where we operate, and the availability of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We are uncertain of the potential long-term impacts of the pandemic on our business, and the severity, duration, and timing of the business and economic impacts from the continuing, unprecedented public health effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, which has previously included, and may in the future include, among other things, significant volatility in financial markets and a sharp decrease in the value of equity securities, including our common stock. 17 As a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions. Our business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic and other conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder United States economic growth. As an example, the continued fallout of the global pandemic has resulted in wide reaching shutdown of certain businesses regions in which we operate. Depending on future developments (including the extent of the virus’s spread, new variants and the measures, such as quarantines and travel restrictions, taken to contain such spread), the outbreak may adversely affect economic conditions in the United States generally and our markets in particular. Weak economic conditions are characterized by numerous factors; such as deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. The current economic environment is also characterized by interest rates at near historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our loan and investment portfolios. All of these factors can individually or in the aggregate be detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our business and operations are concentrated in our Target Market, and we are more sensitive than our more geographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy. Unlike with many of our larger competitors that maintain significant operations located outside our market area, substantially all of our clients are individuals and businesses located and doing business in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 73% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market. Therefore, our success will depend upon the general economic conditions in this area, which we cannot predict with certainty. As a result, our operations and profitability may be more adversely affected by a local economic downturn in our Target Market than those of larger, more geographically diverse competitors. For example, the Nashville, Tennessee economy is particularly sensitive to changes in the healthcare service, music and entertainment and hospitality and tourism industries, among others. A downturn in these industries or in the local economy generally could make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay their loans and may lead to loan losses that are not offset by operations in other markets; it may also reduce the ability of depositors to make or maintain deposits with us. For these reasons, any regional or local economic downturn that affects our Target market, or existing or prospective borrowers or depositors in our Target Market could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. From time to time, our bank may provide financing to clients who own or have companies or properties located outside our Target Market. In such cases, we would face similar local market risk in those communities for these clients. Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability. The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, internet banks, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our service area. These competitors often have far greater resources than we do and are able to conduct more intensive and broader-based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and individual clients. Our competitors may be able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we choose or have the capability to offer. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. We compete with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we must attract our client base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of 18 consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with an array of financial institutions in our service area. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things: Increased competition could require us to increase the rates that we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. We derive a substantial majority of our business from our Target Market, which is a highly competitive banking market. Our failure to compete effectively in our market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. As a bank that focuses on building comprehensive banking relationships with clients, our reputation is critical to our business, and damage to it could have a material adverse effect on us. A key differentiating factor for our business is the strong brand we are building in our Target Market. Through our branding, we communicate to the market about our company and the products and services we offer. Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining clients and employees. Adverse perceptions of us could make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including actual or perceived employee misconduct, misconduct by our outsourced service providers or other counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, our failure to meet our standards of service and quality and compliance failures. Negative publicity regarding us or our bank, whether or not accurate, may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Credit and Interest Rate Risks We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients, who may have greater credit risk than larger borrowers. We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive, economic or financial pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. 19 Lack of seasoning of our loan portfolio could increase risk of credit defaults in the future. As a result of our growth over the past several years, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 58% of our loan portfolio had been originated since December 31, 2018, including new originations and renewals. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as “seasoning.” As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Because a large portion of our portfolio is relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level of delinquencies and defaults that could occur as the portfolio becomes more seasoned and may not serve as a reliable basis for predicting the health and nature of our loan portfolio. Our limited experience with these loans does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of our loan portfolio. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We may not be able to adequately assess and limit our credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability. A primary component of our business involves making loans to clients. The business of lending is inherently risky because the principal of or interest on the loan may not be repaid timely or at all or the value of any collateral supporting the loan may be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower’s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring our loan applicants and the concentration of our loans and our credit approval practices, may not adequately assess credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively assess and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Repayment of our leveraged loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our leveraged loans are primarily commercial in nature. Frequently, these loans have a secondary source of repayment that is directly correlated with the primary source of repayment. Leveraged borrowers may have a diminished ability to adjust to unexpected events and changes in business conditions because of a higher ratio of liabilities to capital, and in some cases, reliance is placed on enterprise value as a secondary source of repayment. The repayment of leveraged loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and on enterprise value as a secondary source of repayment. To mitigate this risk, we give enhanced scrutiny to leveraged loan transactions, assess risk probabilities using benchmarks obtained from external rating agencies, and engage higher levels of senior management and board involvement in the approval and ongoing review of leveraged loan relationships. Highly Levered Transaction (“HLT”) loan balances to customers amounted to $27.1 million, or 1.4% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021. Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management’s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes in a relatively short time period. Inaccurate management assumptions, continuing deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan portfolio and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and may require adjustments based upon judgments that are different than those of management. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, we may need to increase our provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for such losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 20 Our commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans. Our loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, or CRE loans, to individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as construction and land development loans. CRE loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Weak economic conditions or other market factors can result in increased vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial property. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate under adverse conditions. Additionally, non-owner-occupied CRE loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner-occupied CRE loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We mitigate these risks both in our selection criteria for borrowers and project sponsors and in our general practice of requiring cash equity contributions substantially in excess of Supervisory Loan to Value limits as set forth in Appendix A of Part 365 – Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies. A prolonged downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and adversely affect our profitability. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 31% of our loan portfolio was composed of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 11% of owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 17% consumer real estate loans, and 11% construction and land development loans. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A decline in real estate values could further impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amounts we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. If we are required to re-value the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Regulatory requirements affecting our loans secured by commercial real estate could limit our ability to leverage our capital and adversely affect our growth and profitability. The federal banking agencies have indicated their view that banks with high concentrations of loans secured by commercial real estate are subject to increased risk and should implement robust risk management policies and maintain higher capital than regulatory minimums to maintain an appropriate cushion against loss that is commensurate with the perceived risk. Guidance from the Federal banking agencies identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk as those that have (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land loans representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital if the outstanding balance of the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on commercial real estate, a change in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us or a decline in our regulatory capital could limit our ability to leverage our capital as a result of these policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral and own the underlying real estate, subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property. Since we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: 21 Our inability to manage the amount of costs or size of the risks associated with the ownership of real estate, or write-downs in the value of other real estate owned, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position that could materially adversely affect our performance. Risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position could materially adversely affect our performance. Home equity products, particularly those where we are in a second lien position, and particularly those in certain geographic areas, may carry a higher risk of non-collection than other loans. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. Of our $155.6 million home equity portfolio at December 31, 2021, approximately $151.4 million were home equity lines of credit and $4.2 million were closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $84.5 million of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position. We have several large depositor relationships, the loss of which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources. As of December 31, 2021, our ten largest non-brokered depositors accounted for approximately 15% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. We may also be forced, as a result of any withdrawal of deposits, to rely more heavily on other, potentially more expensive and less stable funding sources. Consequently, the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Correspondent banking introduces unique risks, which could affect our liquidity. Although correspondent banking provides diversification of our funding base, it introduces a unique set of risks. Increases in the federal funds rate could create liquidity issues within the bank as it competes with the interest on reserves rate paid by the Federal Reserve Bank. Additionally, strong industry-wide loan demand could also create liquidity issues as excess balances held at CapStar Bank by our correspondent banks would presumably be redeployed by those banks into new loans. Further, capital inadequacy or asset quality issues at other institutions could result in increased risk to us due to the potential for large deposit withdrawals. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and our funding sources may be insufficient to fund our future growth. Liquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. An inability to raise funds, at competitive rates or at all, through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. In particular, approximately 86% of our bank’s deposits as of December 31, 2021 22 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice, while by comparison, 63% of the assets of our bank were loans at December 31, 2021, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. For example, we rely on deposits, federal funds purchased and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (“FHLB”) to fund our operations. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions were to change. In such a circumstance, we may seek additional borrowings to achieve our long-term business objectives; however, they may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, whole loan sale agreements may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach representations or warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including government-sponsored entities, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet deposit withdrawals and other client needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our asset growth, new business transactions, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our profits. Our profits, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our interest rate sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2021, meaning that our net interest income would increase from rising interest rates and decline in response due to falling interest rates. However, many assumptions are used to model the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income. Due to the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions, our models may not be an accurate indicator of how our interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The fair value of our investment securities could fluctuate because of factors outside of our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Factors beyond our control could significantly affect the fair value of our investment securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, 23 among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments, or OTTI, and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in earnings and/or other comprehensive income (loss), which could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is OTTI usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer, any collateral underlying the security as well as the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Our failure to assess any impairments or losses with respect to our securities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Changes in monetary policy and government responses to adverse economic conditions such as inflation and deflation may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve, could lead to inflation, deflation, or other economic phenomena that could adversely affect our financial performance. The primary impact of inflation on our operations most likely will be reflected in increased operating costs. Conversely, deflation generally will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality. Strategic Risks Our business strategy includes the continuation of our growth plans, and we could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We intend to continue pursuing our growth strategy for our business through organic growth of our loan and deposit portfolio as well as through strategic acquisitions. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties that can be encountered by financial service companies in rapid growth stages, which include the risks associated with the following: We may not be able to expand our presence in our existing market or new markets. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas, the availability of capital to fund growth opportunities and our ability to manage our growth. Failure to manage our growth effectively could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our bank’s size presents multiple challenges that may restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy, such as our regulatory and internal lending limits and our ability to effectively leverage our infrastructure to implement our business strategy. 24 We are limited in the amount our bank can loan in the aggregate to a single borrower or related borrowers by the amount of the bank’s capital. CapStar Bank is a Tennessee-chartered bank and therefore is subject to the legal lending limits of the state of Tennessee and federal law. Tennessee and federal legal lending limits are safety and soundness measures intended to prevent one person or a relatively small and economically related group of persons from borrowing an unduly large amount of a bank’s funds. They are also intended to safeguard a bank’s depositors by diversifying the risk of loan losses among a relatively large number of credit-worthy borrowers engaged in various types of businesses. Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower generally may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. We have also established an internal limit on loans to one borrower to be between $10 million and $25 million, depending upon the underlying risk rating of the borrower. Loans in excess of our internal limit are noted as a policy exception and require approval by the Bank's Executive Committee. Based upon our bank’s current capital levels, the amount it may lend is significantly less than that of many of our larger competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of the bank’s lending limit from doing business with us. Our bank accommodates larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available. If we are unable to compete effectively for loans from our target clients, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our growth strategy involves strategic acquisitions, and we may not be able to overcome risks associated with such transactions. We plan to continue to explore opportunities to acquire other financial institutions and businesses in or around our existing Target Market or in comparable markets or that would provide scale, low cost of funds, non-interest income or products that are additive to our existing products and services. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the following: We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying prospective transactions, making it difficult to implement our growth strategy. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future to fund such growth, and the unavailability of additional capital on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect us or our growth. We believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our capital needs for our immediate growth plans. However, we will continue to need capital to support our longer-term growth plans. If capital is not available on favorable terms when we need it, we may have to either issue common stock or other securities on less than desirable terms or reduce 25 our rate of growth until market conditions become more favorable. Either of such events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Operational Risks Deterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and federal agency securities could adversely affect us and our banking operations. The long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government is uncertain, as illustrated by the 2011 downgrade by certain rating agencies of the credit rating of the U.S. government and federal agencies. However, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any future downgrade, failure to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the U.S. federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. In particular, such events could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect our profitability. Also, the adverse consequences of any downgrade could extend to those to whom we extend credit and could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, other third parties, and our employees. When we originate loans, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal, title information and employment and income documentation. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the fair value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, the borrower, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. The persons and entities involved in such a misrepresentation are often difficult to locate, and we are often unable to collect any monetary losses that we have suffered from them. We may bear costs associated with the proliferation of computer theft and cyber-crime. We necessarily collect, use and hold sensitive data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with client expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. Although we actively invest in the security of our technological infrastructure, it is not feasible to defend against every risk posed by rapid technological development and the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our information technology department and third-party vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our employees or other internal sources, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our client accounts may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from network failures, viruses and malware, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters and catastrophic events. A breach of our security or the security of our third-party vendors that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, client notification requirements, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage, any of which could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 26 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us. Our risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, liquidity, capital, financial performance, asset/liability, operational, compliance and regulatory, Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, strategic and reputational, information technology and legal. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances, including if our management fails to follow our credit policies and procedures, and thus, it may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. We depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption in the operation of these systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of clients, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data. We rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio accounting. For example, one vendor provides our core banking system through a service bureau arrangement. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of client data. We may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. We may need to switch third-party service providers from time-to-time, which could result in disruption to our business processes, damage to our reputation and a breach of our data security measures. Such a disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. We encounter technological change continually and have fewer resources than certain of our competitors to invest in technological improvements. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to serving clients better, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our success will depend in part on our ability to address our clients’ needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than us, and in the future, we may not be able to implement new technology-driven products and services timely, effectively or at all or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may, in order to remain competitive, be required to make significant capital expenditures, which may increase our overall expenses and have a material adverse effect on our net income. There is also no guarantee that any such investment in these products and services will create additional efficiencies in our operations. 27 We may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems in the past and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities. In the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our Target Market is susceptible to floods, tornados and other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God, which may adversely affect our business and operations. Substantially all of our business and operations are located in our Target Market, which is an area that has recently been damaged by floods and tornadoes and that is susceptible to other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God. Natural disasters, adverse weather events and acts of God can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. Any economic decline as a result of natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God can reduce the demand for loans and our other client solutions as well as client ability to repay such loans. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on loan portfolios may increase substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God. Therefore, natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God could result in decreased revenue and loan losses that have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Climate change and societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including indirectly through impact to our customers. The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require businesses to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. It is not possible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, we operate in areas where our business and the activities of our customers could be impacted by the effects of climate change. The effects of climate change may include increased frequency or severity of weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts and rising sea levels. These effects can disrupt business operations, damage property, devalue assets and change customer and business preferences, which may adversely affect borrowers, increase credit risk and reduce demand for our products and services. The Company and our customers 28 will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. As a result, the Company and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes and the like. The impact to our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk. We use interest rate swaps to help manage our interest rate risk from recorded financial assets and liabilities when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and the asset or liability exposes us to interest rate risk. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and routine monitoring, and is not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. We also have derivatives that result from a service we provide to certain qualifying clients approved through our credit process, and therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the uncollateralized fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rate changes cause the value of our derivatives to decline – though to the extent the derivatives are effective hedges, changes in the value of derivative derivatives could be largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged item. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of lawsuits and related legal proceedings, governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm. Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we may not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings or government or other inquiries. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly materially so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, if we cannot comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or attest that our internal control over financial 29 reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting when required, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely. As a result, investors, counterparties and customers may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports; our liquidity, access to capital markets and perceptions of our creditworthiness could be adversely affected; and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. These events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and hiring additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the Tax Reform Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The Tax Reform Act significantly changes how corporations in the United States are taxed. The Tax Reform Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As a result, we have recorded a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Reform Act on our deferred tax assets in our financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the Tax Reform Act, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The impact of the Tax Reform Act on our shareholders is uncertain and could be adverse. This Report does not discuss the manner in which the Tax Reform Act might affect our shareholders. Accordingly, we encourage our shareholders to consult with their own legal and tax advisors with respect to the Tax Reform Act and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock. We may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate. In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). This announcement indicated that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that the publication of most LIBOR term rates will end on June 30, 2023 (excluding one-week U.S. LIBOR and two-month U.S. LIBOR, the publication of which ended on December 31, 2021). The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a committee of U.S. financial market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the reference rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR. The federal banking agencies have encouraged banking organizations to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and to ensure existing contracts have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate. Market participants are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to outstanding derivatives and cash markets indexed to LIBOR. While the benchmark provider for U.S. LIBOR (which was typically the benchmark that the Company used) intends to provide the benchmark for some tenors of U.S. LIBOR through June 2023, as of January, 2022 we no longer originate or renew instruments linked to LIBOR, instead offering indices such as prime or SOFR. 30 We have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR, though the majority are scheduled to mature prior to the June 30, 2023 expected date for cessation of most LIBOR tenors. The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk. Since alternative reference rates are calculated differently than LIBOR, payments under contracts referencing new alternative reference rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition has changed and will continue to change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. We cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be; however, failure to adequately manage the transition could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation with our customers. Changes in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our Company’s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations . There have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export, including among others, agricultural products, could cause the prices of our customers’ products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt; which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our customers' costs, demand for our customers' products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory and Compliance Risks We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our business activities and impose financial requirements, such as minimum capital requirements, and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies including the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. Regulatory compliance is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, transactions with affiliates, treatment of our clients, and interest rates paid on deposits. We are also subject to financial requirements prescribed by our regulators such as minimum capitalization guidelines, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. Violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank acquisitions and other activities. Recently, banks generally have faced increased regulatory sanctions and scrutiny particularly with respect to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, or USA Patriot Act, and other statutes relating to anti-money laundering compliance and client privacy. Recent legislation has substantially changed, and increased, federal regulation of financial institutions, and there may be significant future legislation (and regulations under existing legislation) that could have a further material effect on bank holding companies like us and banks like CapStar Bank. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. 31 Federal and state regulators periodically examine our business and may require us to remediate adverse examination findings or may take enforcement action against us. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, the Federal Reserve or the TDFI were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to require us to remediate any such adverse examination findings. In addition, these agencies have the power to take enforcement action against us to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation of law or regulation or unsafe or unsound practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, to limit dividends and distributions, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory enforcement action against us could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to numerous fair lending laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. The CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking agencies, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on product offerings. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial service providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service, or IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the requirement to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Financial reform legislation has, among other things, tightened capital standards, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and resulted in new regulations that are likely to increase our costs of operations. As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act depends on the rules and regulations that implement it. 32 Among many other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress. Under federal law and long-standing Federal Reserve policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our bank, and to commit resources to support our bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our shareholders’ or creditors,’ best interests to do so. A requirement to provide such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of repayment to deposit liabilities of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment over general unsecured creditor claims. Our FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase. The deposits of our bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments as determined according to the calculation described in “Supervision and Regulation—Bank Regulation and Supervision—FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments.” High levels of bank failures since the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund following the financial crisis, the FDIC increased deposit insurance assessment rates and charged special assessments to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Even though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange. The trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock. 33 The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. A future issuance or future issuances of stock could dilute the value of our common stock. Our charter permits us to issue up to an aggregate of 25 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, 22,166,129 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, including 177,020 shares of restricted common stock that have yet to vest. Those shares outstanding do not include the potential issuance, as of December 31, 2021, of 113,578 shares of our common stock subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options under the Stock Incentive Plan, and 1,168,174 additional shares of our common stock that were reserved for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan. A future issuance of any new shares of our common stock would, and equity-related securities could, cause further dilution in the value of our outstanding shares of common stock. Significant sales of our common stock by certain shareholders could affect the market value of our common stock. On December 21, 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf Registrations Statement”) with the SEC on Form S-3 registering 3,652,094 shares of our common stock held by certain of our long-time shareholders, representing about 20.7% of our total issued and outstanding common stock. The Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 28, 2019. Accordingly, these shares represent a significant number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and, if sold in the market all at once or at about the same time, could depress the market price of our common stock and could further affect our ability to raise equity capital. Further, we cannot predict the size or the effect, if any, that sales of these shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may have on the market price of our shares of common stock or our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Any significant sales of these shares could have a materially adverse impact on our affairs, assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, short- and long-term performance goals, prospects and results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in our bank, to secure that debt. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, interest must be paid to a lender before dividends can be paid to our shareholders, and, in the case of liquidation, our borrowings must be repaid before we can distribute any assets to our shareholders. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if our bank were profitable. The rights of our common shareholders would likely be subordinate to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue an aggregate of up to five million shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. Accordingly, you should assume that any shares of preferred stock that we may issue in the future will also be senior to our common stock. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. We and our bank are subject to capital and other legal and regulatory requirements which restrict our ability to pay dividends. We are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. In addition, because our bank is our only material asset, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on our receipt of dividends from the bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. 34 General Risks We are dependent on the services of our management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key personnel or directors may adversely affect our business and operations. We are led by an experienced core management team with substantial experience in the markets that we serve, and our operating strategy focuses on providing products and services through long-term relationship managers and ensuring that our largest clients have relationships with our senior management team. Accordingly, our success depends in large part on the performance of these key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. If any of our executive officers, other key personnel, or directors leaves us or our bank, our operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, our directors’ community involvement and diverse and extensive local business relationships are important to our success. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVE D STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. P ROPERTIES Our headquarters and main branch office are located at 1201 Demonbreun Street, Suites 700 and 103, respectively, Nashville, Tennessee 37203. The Company owns and leases retail bank branches located throughout Tennessee. The Company leases certain premises and equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates, through 2032, and in most instances include options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We and our subsidiaries may be involved from time to time in various routine legal proceedings incidental to our respective businesses. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are currently engaged in any legal proceedings that are expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. ITEM 4. MINE SAF ETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 35 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STO CKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES CapStar Financial’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CSTR” and has traded on that market since September 22, 2016. Prior to that time, there was no established public trading market for our stock. As of February 24, 2022, there were approximately 3,892 holders of record of shares of our common stock. Dividend Policy Holders of shares of our voting and non-voting common and preferred stock are only entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for dividends. As of the date of this Report, only shares of our common stock are issued and outstanding. As a Tennessee corporation, we are not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. Because we are a bank holding company and do not engage directly in business activities of a material nature, our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock depends, in large part, upon our receipt of dividends from our bank, which is also subject to numerous limitations on the payment of dividends under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. Pursuant to Tennessee law, our bank may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank’s net income for that year plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. For additional information, see “Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Bank Regulation and Supervision—Payment of Dividends.” Subject to the regulatory restrictions noted above and satisfactory financial results, the Company currently expects that comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders in the future will depend on regulatory restrictions and our liquidity and capital requirements, as well as our earnings and financial condition, the general economic climate, contractual restrictions, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Stock Performance Graph The following stock performance graphs compare total shareholders' return on our common stock for the five and three year periods beginning at the close of trading on December 31, 2016 until December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2018 until December 31, 2021, respectively, with the cumulative total return of the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq Bank Index for the same period. While historically we have compared shareholders’ return on our common stock to the Nasdaq Composite Index and Nasdaq Bank Index as an implied benchmark, we do not believe these indices to be an optimal frame of reference or benchmark indicative of the Company’s size or characteristics. Specifically, the Nasdaq composite index contains a significant concentration of tech companies which are fundamentally different than the community banking industry at large, and the Nasdaq Bank index includes financial institutions much larger in size than the Company. Therefore, we believe the Russell 2000 Index and ABA Nasdaq Community Bank Index are more appropriate comparative indices. The Russell 2000 Index is comprised of a more diverse subset of companies across multiple industries with more similar characteristics to that of the Company. Similarly, the ABA Nasdaq Community Bank Index is a more comparable index given it is comprised of a more narrowly defined subset of community banks. As such, the following stock performance graphs include references to both the newly selected indices (The Russell 2000 Index and ABA Nasdaq Community Bank Index) and the indices used in previous years (The Nasdaq Composite Index and Nasdaq Bank Index). In future periods we will only reference the newly selected indices for purposes of comparing total shareholders’ return on our common stock. Cumulative total return is computed by dividing the difference between the share price of our common stock at the end and the beginning of the measurement period by the share price of our common stock at the beginning of the measurement period. The performance graphs assume $100 is invested on December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2018 in shares of our common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the ABA Nasdaq Community Bank Index and that dividends are reinvested into additional shares of common stock at the same frequency with which dividends are paid on such shares during the applicable fiscal year. Historical stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under the caption “Part II., Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law. The following discussion and analysis pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, the following discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level. All dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when otherwise specifically noted. Unless specifically noted in this Report, all references in this section to the fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 mean our fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. Overview We completed 2021 with net income of $48.7 million, or $2.19 diluted net income per share, compared to net income of $24.7 million and $22.4 million, or $1.22 and $1.20 diluted net income per share, for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Average loans held for investment for 2021 were $1.91 billion, a 13.0% increase over 2020, and average deposits for 2021 were $2.70 billion, a 19.2% increase over 2020. We acquired FCB and BOW on July 1, 2020, which has impacted the comparability of our financial performance. Specifically, the Company's net interest income and non-interest income generally benefited from an additional six months of FCB and BOW income for the year ended December 31, 2021. Conversely, non-interest expense increased for the same period due to the acquisitions. The 2020 FCB and BOW acquisitions, as well as the Company's 2021 organic entrance into the Chattanooga market continue to demonstrate our growth opportunities. The Company continues its proactive approach to protect our team members and their families. The Company's Pandemic Committee continues to meet and discuss the health and safety of employees as well as to discuss updates provided by the Centers for Disease Control (""CDC""), state and local authorities. At this time, all financial centers and support operations centers are operating in a non-remote environment. Although the economic and public health outlooks improved in the United States during 2021, the future impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain. Should current economic conditions deteriorate or if the pandemic continues to intensify through the spread of more contagious or severe strains of COVID-19, the pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and financial condition. Altho ugh infection rates in the communities we serve vary, the positive impact that vaccinations have had on curbing the spread of the virus allowed us to begin bringing departments back together and to loosen travel restrictions for colleagues who are fully vaccinated. Given the COVID-19 variants currently spreading, we are strongly advising our colleagues who are fully vaccinated to get vaccination boosters. We will continue to make prudent decisions for the safety of our colleagues and our clients following recommended CDC and local health department guidance. We are hopeful that infection rates will decline in the communities we serve as the percentage of fully vaccinated and boosted individuals continues to increase. In an effort to serve as a source of liquidity in our community at the onset of the pandemic, CapStar Bank proactively offered a 90-day full deferment of all loan payments to CapStar borrowers that were less than 30 days past due. As of December 31, 2021 the remaining loans still under deferment has been reduced to four loans (representing approximately $32.2 million in outstanding loan balances). As of December 31, 2021, the remaining outstanding balance of loans originated under the PPP totaled approximately $26.5 million and was included in commercial and industrial loans. 40 As the pandemic continues, we will continue to assess the impact on our market. While it is uncertain losses will materialize in the future, we will continue to proactively work with our clients and evaluate the potential impact of the pandemic on them and us. Furthermore, we currently do not anticipate a significant adverse liquidity impact related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, since the start of the pandemic, deposit inflows have increased sharply, significantly strengthening liquidity. Nonetheless, the Company has a comprehensive contingency funding plan that addresses potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements that may arise from the COVID-19 pandemic. See further discussion regarding the Company’s management of liquidity risk in the subsequent section titled ‘Liquidity’. Despite the uncertainty the Company is well positioned to continue delivering on its strategic initiatives in a responsible manner by prioritizing things such as business continuity, liquidity management and maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses. Our primary revenue source is net interest income and fees from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to our overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and the rates paid on deposits directly impact our profitability. Business volumes are influenced by competition, new business acquisition efforts and economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence. Net interest income increased $14.8 million, or 19.5%, to $91.2 million for 2021 compared to $76.3 million for 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of FCB and BOW, increased PPP income and lower interest rates across deposit categories when compared to 2020. Net interest margin increased to 3.16% for 2021, compared with 3.10% for 2020. The year ended December 31, 2021 yielded a ($1.1) million release of loan loss reserves compared to a $11.5 million provision in 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to improved asset quality trends, significant improvement in specific classified loans and other qualitative factors. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management’s evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for the estimated probable inherent losses on outstanding loans. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 was 1.10% of total loans held for investment, compared with 1.23% at December 31, 2020. While benefitting from the FCB and BOW acquisitions, total noninterest income for 2021 remained relatively unchanged at $42.7 million compared to $43.2 million for 2020, and comprised 31.9% of total revenues. Despite the impact of the FCB and BOW acquisitions, total noninterest expense for 2021 decreased $3.9 million, or 4.9%, to $73.5 million compared to $77.4 million for 2020. Improving productivity and operating efficiency is a key focus of the Company. The efficiency ratio for 2021 was 54.94% compared to 64.70% for 2020. The improvement in efficiency ratio for 2021 is primarily attributable to greater expense discipline in accordance with the Company's core strategy and a decline in acquisition related expenses. The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 20.7% for 2021 from 19.6% for 2020. The higher effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 is mainly the result of net operating loss carryback provisions associated with the CARES Act in 2020. Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a measure of a company's capital which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Our ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets was 10.77% as of December 31, 2021, compared with 10.00% at December 31, 2020. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The following sections provide more details on subjects presented in this overview. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which are contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may materially and adversely affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or 41 adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate. Allowance for Loan Losses We record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit-worthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses, particularly the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different from our estimates. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included elsewhere in this Report. Investment Securities Impairment We assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded in earnings. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is “more likely than not” that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period, and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits. Business Combinations Assets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the loans are considered impaired, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. 42 Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted as necessary for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisions that may be required.

Net Interest Income The largest component of our net income is net interest income – the difference between the income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets and interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by total average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our net interest income. The following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and 43 interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Interest-Earning Assets Loans (1) $ 1,910,115 $ 84,368 4.42 % $ 1,690,179 $ 78,180 4.63 % $ 1,450,400 $ 78,557 5.42 % Loans held for sale 152,482 4,851 3.18 % 175,311 6,092 3.47 % 101,885 4,271 4.19 % Securities: Taxable investment securities (2) 441,495 7,213 1.63 % 250,042 5,455 2.18 % 176,647 5,374 3.04 % Investment securities exempt from federal income tax (3) 61,438 1,408 2.90 % 49,474 1,326 3.39 % 52,392 1,438 3.47 % Total securities 502,933 8,621 1.79 % 299,516 6,781 2.38 % 229,039 6,812 3.14 % Cash balances in other banks 317,406 598 0.19 % 307,852 799 0.26 % 87,305 1,881 2.15 % Funds sold 14,640 21 0.14 % 18 - 2.77 % 752 26 3.52 % Total interest-earning assets 2,897,576 98,459 3.41 % 2,472,876 91,852 3.73 % 1,869,381 91,547 4.92 % Noninterest-earning assets 224,776 149,760 137,947 Total assets $ 3,122,352 $ 2,622,636 $ 2,007,328 Interest-Bearing Liabilities Interest bearing deposits: Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 955,553 1,626 0.17 % $ 744,144 3,868 0.52 % $ 499,468 7,538 1.51 % Savings and money market deposits 594,652 1,203 0.20 % 549,533 5,196 0.95 % 494,587 7,266 1.47 % Time deposits 417,770 2,873 0.69 % 407,224 5,317 1.31 % 361,956 7,542 2.08 % Total interest-bearing deposits 1,967,975 5,702 0.29 % 1,700,901 14,381 0.85 % 1,356,011 22,346 1.65 % Borrowings and repurchase agreements 30,574 1,587 5.19 % 27,809 1,148 4.13 % 48,629 1,453 2.99 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,998,549 7,289 0.36 % 1,728,710 15,529 0.90 % 1,404,640 23,799 1.69 % Noninterest-bearing deposits 725,075 558,416 315,031 Total funding sources 2,723,624 2,287,126 1,719,671 Noninterest-bearing liabilities 34,969 29,762 23,533 Shareholders’ equity 363,759 305,748 264,124 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 3,122,352 $ 2,622,636 $ 2,007,328 Net interest spread (4) 3.05 % 2.83 % 3.22 % Net interest income/margin (5) $ 91,170 3.16 % $ 76,323 3.10 % $ 67,748 3.64 % 44 The following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates earned or paid on these assets and liabilities. 2021 Compared to 2020 2020 Compared to 2019 Increase (decrease) due to Increase (decrease) due to Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net Interest-Earning Assets Loans $ 10,173 $ (3,985 ) $ 6,188 $ 13,212 $ (13,589 ) $ (377 ) Loans held for sale (793 ) (448 ) (1,241 ) 2,935 (1,114 ) 1,821 Securities: Taxable investment securities 4,148 (2,390 ) 1,758 2,233 (2,152 ) 81 Investment securities exempt from federal income tax 379 (297 ) 82 (71 ) (40 ) (111 ) Total securities 4,527 (2,687 ) 1,840 2,162 (2,192 ) (30 ) Cash balances In other banks 25 (226 ) (201 ) 4,749 (5,831 ) (1,082 ) Funds Sold 405 (384 ) 21 (26 ) — (26 ) Total interest-earning assets 14,337 (7,730 ) 6,607 23,032 (22,726 ) 306 Interest Bearing Liabilities Interest-bearing transaction accounts 1,099 (3,341 ) (2,242 ) 3,693 (7,362 ) (3,669 ) Savings and money market deposits 427 (4,420 ) (3,993 ) 807 (2,877 ) (2,070 ) Time deposits 138 (2,582 ) (2,444 ) 943 (3,168 ) (2,225 ) Borrowings and repurchase agreements 114 325 439 (622 ) 317 (305 ) Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,778 (10,018 ) (8,240 ) 4,821 (13,090 ) (8,269 ) Net Interest Income $ 12,559 $ 2,288 $ 14,847 $ 18,211 $ (9,636 ) $ 8,575 2021 compared to 2020 Our net interest income increased $14.8 million, or 19.5%, from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a 13.0% increase in average loans held for investment and a 54 basis point or 60.0% decline in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities as we have worked to lower our cost of deposits across all categories. The loan increase is primarily attributable to a combination of the FCB and BOW acquisitions, expansions into new markets and fee income associated with PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns. PPP fees recognized as income totaled $7.2 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 also benefited from a 67.9% increase in average total securities offset by a 59 basis point or 24.8% decrease in average security yield as yields on investments purchased were depressed by a sharp decline in market interest rates as the Federal Reserve lowered short-term rates to historically low levels in response to t he pandemic. 2020 compared to 2019 Net interest income increased $8.6 million, or 12.7%, from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to a 32% increase in average earning assets associated with the FCB and BOW acquisitions, which was offset by a 54 basis point decline in the net interest margin. Our net interest margin was 3.10% and 3.64% for 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the decline triggered by two factors related to the pandemic – first, the Federal Reserve reducing the Federal Funds target rate by 1.50% in March 2020, one of numerous actions intended to offset the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. economy, and second, the sharp increase in deposits near the start of the pandemic, with deposits increasing $332 million or 19% in the 2nd quarter. Additionally, included in interest expense for savings and money market deposits in 2020 is a loss on previously terminated interest rate swaps of $1.9 million. For 2020 compared to 2019, loan volumes increased 16.8% while loan yields declined from 5.41% to 4.61% due to the impact of lower market interest rates on yields of new loan originations and yields of existing variable rate loans. 45 Average loans for 2020 increased 16.8% compared to 2019 as a result of the FCB and BOW acquisitions, the Company’s active participation in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), additional bankers in the Nashville and Knoxville MSA, and continued focus on attracting new clients. Average security yields decreased from 3.14% to 2.38% for 2019 and 2020, respectively, primarily due to decreases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio, the impact of lower market interest rates on the yields of securities purchased to replace security maturities and paydowns, and the Company’s purchase of additional conservative lower yield securities to deploy a portion of pandemic-related deposit growth. We funded our growth in loans through an increase in funding sources of 33.0% from 2019 to 2020. The primary driver of our increased funding sources was growth in our deposits of 35.2% from 2019 to 2020, driven by the FCB and BOW acquisitions and the sharp increase in deposits near the start of the pandemic. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased 77.3% from 2019 to 2020. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.90% for 2020 compared to 1.69% for 2019. The majority of this decrease was due to decreases in the Federal Funds rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . Provision for Loan losses Our policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets, or particular industry or borrower-specific conditions, which may materially and negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses. Provision expense is impacted by macroeconomic factors, the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of net charge-offs. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 1.10%, 1.23% and 0.89% at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our allowance for loan losses plus fair value purchase accounting marks to non-PPP loans was 1.27%, 1.58%, and 1.13% at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. 2021 compared to 2020 The year ended December 31, 2021 yielded a ($1.1) million release of loan loss reserves compared to a $11.5 million provision in 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to improved asset quality trends, significant improvement in specific classified loans and improvement in COVID-19 qualitative factors within our allowance for loan losses methodology. While the pandemic and its variants are still considered within the Company's current allowance for loan losses, the release in 2021 is a reflection of credit quality metrics returning to pre-pandemic levels. Charge-offs for 2021 were $0.6 million compared to $1.2 million for 2020, while our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment decreased from 1.23% at December 31, 2020 to 1.10% at December 31, 2021. Similarly, these decreases were attributable to improvements in economic conditions through December 31, 2021, as compared to the economic deterioration that occurred or was anticipated during 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and its variants. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. 2020 compared to 2019 The provision for loan losses amounted to $11.5 million and $0.8 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Provision expense increased for 2020 compared to 2019 due to significantly increased qualitative factors in our allowance for loan losses methodology in anticipation of credit deterioration associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although losses have not yet materialized as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our overall reserves are deemed to be adequate in light of the economic uncertainty of the pandemic. Charge-offs for 2020 were $1.2 million compared to $0.8 million for 2019. 46 Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 0.89% at December 31, 2019 to 1.23% at December 31, 2020. This increase was largely due to our assessment of risk generally related to macro-economic, geo-political conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact on asset quality. Noninterest Income In addition to net interest income, we generate recurring noninterest income. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges on deposit accounts, interchange and debit card transaction fees, originating and selling mortgage, commercial real estate and SBA loans, wealth management and gains (losses) on sales of securities. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, we own insurance on several key employees and record income within ""Other noninterest income"" based upon the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. The following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated. 2021-2020 2020-2019 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2021 2020 (Decrease) 2019 (Decrease) Noninterest income: Deposit service charges $ 4,515 $ 3,494 29.2 % $ 3,135 11.5 % Interchange and debit card transaction fees 4,816 3,172 51.8 % 3,251 (2.4 )% Mortgage banking 16,058 25,034 (35.9 )% 9,467 164.4 % Tri-Net 8,613 3,693 133.2 % 2,785 32.6 % Wealth management 1,850 1,573 17.6 % 1,425 10.4 % SBA lending 2,060 1,440 43.1 % 803 79.3 % Net gain (loss) on sale of securities 28 125 (77.6 )% (99 ) (226.3 )% Other noninterest income 4,741 4,717 0.5 % 3,507 34.5 % Total noninterest income $ 42,681 $ 43,248 (1.3 )% $ 24,274 78.2 % 2021 compared to 2020 The increase in interchange and debit card transaction fees and other deposit service charges for 2021 were driven by the incremental increase in transaction volume related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW, an emphasis on electronic banking and continued growth in deposits and volume of our commercial and consumer deposit account. Mortgage banking income consists of mortgage fee income from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Generally, mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from period to period as the rate environment changes. Mortgage banking income decreased 35.9% from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a decline from the peak of the 2020 residential market. Beginning in 2020, we experienced an increase in mortgage lending transactions as a result of the low mortgage interest rate environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this began to decline in 2021 and we expect mortgage lending volume to continue to decline into 2022 given the current environment and forecasted rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Revenue for Tri-Net, a business launched in the fourth quarter of 2016, is derived from the origination and sale of commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. The volume of loan sales has increased through continued growth and development as one the Company's key unique fee businesses. SBA loan sales revenue also increased when compared to the prior year comparable period due to increased volumes and premiums as we continue to invest in and grow our government guaranteed lending division. Other noninterest income primarily consists of loan related fees, bank-owned life insurance and other service-related fees. 47 2020 compared to 2019 The increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2020 was driven primarily by the incremental increase in transaction volume related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW, as well as growth in the volume of our commercial and consumer deposit accounts. Mortgage banking income increased 164.4% from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to a significantly higher volume of originations from home buyers capitalizing on lower interest rates. The increase in other noninterest income of $1.2 million from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to organic growth and our acquisition of FCB and BOW. Noninterest Expense Our total noninterest expense increase reflects expenses that we have incurred as we build the foundation to support and execute our growth strategy. The following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated. 2021-2020 2020-2019 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2021 2020 (Decrease) 2019 (Decrease) Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits $ 41,758 $ 45,252 (7.7 )% $ 35,542 27.3 % Data processing and software 11,248 8,865 26.9 % 6,961 27.4 % Occupancy 4,205 3,590 17.1 % 3,345 7.3 % Equipment 3,507 3,195 9.8 % 3,723 (14.2 )% Professional services 2,155 2,224 (3.1 )% 2,102 5.8 % Regulatory fees 1,031 1,261 (18.2 )% 591 113.4 % Acquisition related expenses 323 5,390 (94.0 )% 2,654 103.1 % Amortization of intangibles 1,939 1,824 6.3 % 1,655 10.2 % Other noninterest expense 7,375 5,760 28.0 % 5,422 6.2 % Total noninterest expense $ 73,541 $ 77,361 (4.9 )% $ 61,995 24.8 % 2021 compared to 2020 Despite the impact of the FCB and BOW acquisitions, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation as mortgage banking results declined compared to 2020, as well as a decrease in severance expense. At December 31, 2021, our associate base increased to 397 employees compared to 380 at December 31, 2020. Data processing and software expense increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth, a full year of our FCB and BOW operations and services related to the processing of PPP loans. Our acquisition-related expenses decreased $5.1 million from 2020 to 2021 due to the absence of the FCB and BOW acquisitions recorded during 2020, and thereby, lower integration-related expenses. Our efficiency ratio was 54.94% and 67.40% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income and measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The improvement in efficiency ratio for 2021 is primarily attributable to greater expense discipline in accordance with the Company's core strategy. 48 2020 compared to 2019 The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by the incremental increase in compensation costs related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW, as well as increased compensation associated with strong revenue growth in mortgage banking. At December 31, 2020, our associate base increased to 380 compared to 289 at December 31, 2019. Data processing and software expense increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth, costs associated with running dual systems related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW and insourcing certain IT related functions. The acquisition related systems conversion was successfully completed during the third quarter of 2020. The increase in occupancy expense from 2019 to 2020 was largely attributable to increased depreciation and other facilities related expenses associated with our acquisitions of FCB and BOW as well as the increasing cost of managing our IT network. Amortization of intangibles increased from 2019 to 2020 due to the new core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the FCB and BOW acquisitions. Our efficiency ratio was 64.70% and 67.41% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The efficiency ratio decreased in 2020 due to operational improvements and synergies achieved through the FCB and BOW acquisitions. Income Taxes 2021 compared to 2020 We recorded income tax expense of $12.7 million and $6.0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 20.7% and 19.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate by our investments in qualified municipal securities, tax benefits from our real estate investment trust, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. The higher effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 is mainly the result of net operating loss carryback provisions associated with the CARES Act in 2020. 2020 compared to 2019 We recorded income tax expense of $6.0 million and $6.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 19.6% and 23.4%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 is mainly the result of net operating loss carryback provisions associated with the CARES Act in 2020. Financial Condition 2021 compared to 2020 Total assets increased $146.0 million or 4.9%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Loans held for investment grew from $1.884 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.966 billion at December 31, 2021, a 4.4% increase. The increase was supported by organic loan growth partially offset by approximately $159.5 million in net paydowns of forgiven PPP loans by the SBA. Loans held for sale decreased $103.3 million or 55.2%, during 2021 which is primarily related to the timing of selling residential and commercial real estate loans. Cash and cash equivalents increased $137.7 million or 49.6% as the Company continued to experience excess liquidity and grow deposits. Total liabilities increased $109.4 million or 4.1% from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Deposits increased $116.3 million to $2.684 billion at December 31, 2021, a 4.5% increase. While in the short-term the Company is experiencing a period of excess liquidity, a key longer-term strategic initiative is to create a stronger deposit-led culture with an emphasis on lower cost relationship-based deposits. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s lowest cost deposit category, noninterest bearing, increased $62.2 million December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, while higher cost time deposits decreased $96.5 million or 20.5%. Other changes in deposits from 2020 to 2021 included a $100.5 million increase or 11.9% in interest-bearing deposits and a $50.0 million or 8.5% increase in savings and money market accounts. 49 2020 compared to 2019 Total assets increased $946.9 million or 46.5% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Loans held for investment grew from $1.418 billion at December 31, 2019 to $1.884 billion at December 31, 2020, a 32.9% increase. Loans held for sale increased $16.3 million or 9.6% during 2020 which is primarily related to the timing of selling residential and commercial real estate loans. Available for sale securities increased $278.1 million, or 128%, as the Company deployed excess capital into such investments. Also, included in these changes is growth from our acquisitions of FCB and BOW which included $514.7 million in total assets, primarily made up of $294.7 million in loans and $98.7 million in securities. Total liabilities increased $876.5 million, or 49.7%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Deposits increased from $1.729 billion at December 31, 2019 to $2.568 billion at December 31, 2020, a 48.5% increase. Included in liabilities is the third quarter issuance of $29.4 million in subordinated debt during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, total liabilities and deposits acquired in our FCB and BOW acquisitions were $447.4 million and $442.7 million, respectively. Investment Securities The investment portfolio plays a key role in the management of liquidity and interest rate risk, and provides another source of interest income. In managing the composition of the balance sheet, we seek a balance between earnings sources and credit and liquidity considerations. We manage our investment portfolio according to a written investment policy approved by our board of directors. Balances in our investment portfolio are subject to change over time based on our funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of funds, and are maintained at levels we believe are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, agency mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions, asset-backed securities and other debt securities, all with varying contractual maturities. However, these maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as some of these securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. The investment portfolio is regularly reviewed by the Asset Liability Management committee, or ALCO, of the bank to ensure an appropriate risk and return profile as well as for adherence to the investment policy. 50 Our investment portfolio totaled $461.2 million, $488.6 million, and $216.4 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our investment portfolio increased significantly in 2020 as part of our efforts to improve balance sheet management through investing in high quality securities and deploying excess liquidity resulting from increased deposits. See “Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our investment securities. The following table presents the fair value of our securities as of December 31, 2021 by their stated maturities (this maturity schedule excludes security prepayment and call features), as well as the weighted average yields for each maturity range.

Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. The composition of gross loans and leases at December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate - owner occupied $ 209,261 10.6 % $ 162,603 8.6 % $ 172,456 12.2 % $ 141,864 9.9 % $ 101,132 10.7 % Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied 616,023 31.3 % 481,229 25.5 % 387,443 27.3 % 408,582 28.6 % 249,490 26.3 % Consumer real estate 326,412 16.6 % 343,791 18.3 % 256,097 18.1 % 253,562 17.8 % 102,581 10.8 % Construction and land development 214,310 10.9 % 174,859 9.3 % 143,111 10.1 % 174,670 12.2 % 82,586 8.7 % Commercial and industrial 497,615 25.3 % 623,446 33.1 % 391,951 27.6 % 402,809 28.2 % 373,248 39.4 % Consumer 46,811 2.4 % 44,279 2.4 % 28,426 2.0 % 25,615 1.8 % 6,862 0.8 % Other 55,337 2.8 % 53,483 2.8 % 38,161 2.7 % 20,901 1.5 % 31,638 3.3 % Total gross loans held for investment $ 1,965,769 100.0 % $ 1,883,690 100.0 % $ 1,417,645 100.0 % $ 1,428,003 100.0 % $ 947,537 100.0 % Over the past five years, we have experienced significant growth in our loan portfolio. During 2017 and continuing through 2021, we recognized growth in the commercial real estate loan classifications reflecting the development of the Target Market in which we operate. The acquisitions of Athens, FCB and BOW have increased various loan 51 balance classifications and provided further diversity in our loan portfolio through more consumer-oriented loan products. Our primary focus has been on commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending, which constituted 67% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021. Although we expect continued growth with respect to our loan portfolio, we do not expect any significant changes over the foreseeable future in the composition of our loan portfolio or in our emphasis on commercial lending. Our loan growth since inception has been reflective of the Target Market in which we serve. The commercial real estate category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans which are similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the affiliated business rather than on the valuation and cash flows of the real estate from unaffiliated tenants. Since 2009, our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios have continued to experience strong growth, primarily due to implementation of our relationship-based banking model and the success of our relationship managers in transitioning commercial banking relationships from other local financial institutions and in competing for new business from attractive small to mid-sized commercial clients. Many of our larger commercial clients have lengthy relationships with members of our senior management team or our relationship managers that date back to their employment by other financial institutions. The repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes for our loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. December 31, 2021 Due in 1 year or less Due in 1-5 years Due after 5-15 years Due after 15 years Total Commercial real estate $ 50,351 $ 432,346 $ 307,238 $ 35,349 $ 825,284 Consumer real estate 15,674 47,357 185,319 78,062 326,412 Construction and land development 52,776 98,993 25,243 37,298 214,310 Commercial and industrial 144,981 233,337 115,806 3,491 497,615 Consumer 12,568 31,964 2,252 27 46,811 Other 5,983 19,735 29,619 — 55,337 Gross loans $ 282,333 $ 863,732 $ 665,477 $ 154,227 $ 1,965,769 Interest rate sensitivity Fixed interest rates 111,789 544,463 388,459 39,986 1,084,697 Floating or adjustable interest rates 170,544 319,269 277,018 114,241 881,072 Total gross loans $ 282,333 $ 863,732 $ 665,477 $ 154,227 $ 1,965,769 The information presented in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio. Asset Quality One of our key objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality in our loan portfolio. We utilize disciplined and thorough underwriting processes that collaboratively engage our seasoned and experienced business bankers and credit underwriters in the analysis of each loan request. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ scaled review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our Chief Credit Policy Officer, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. In addition, we have adopted underwriting guidelines to be followed by our lending officers that require senior management review of proposed extensions of credit exceeding certain thresholds. When delinquencies exist, we monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. Our loan review procedures include approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors of our bank, an independent loan review, approval of larger credit relationships by our bank’s Credit Committee and loan quality documentation procedures. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to the risk that our loan portfolio will be subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. 52 We target small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of such businesses and other consumers and high net worth individuals as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive or economic pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We use an independent consulting firm to review our loans for quality in addition to the reviews that may be conducted internally and by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process. Our bank has procedures and processes in place intended to assess whether losses exceed the potential amounts documented in our bank’s impairment analyses and to reduce potential losses in the remaining performing loans within our loan portfolio. These procedures and processes include the following: Our bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Our bank analyzes loans individually by classifying each loan as to credit risk. This analysis includes all commercial loans and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000, individually. This analysis is performed on a regular basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least an annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the risk rating of each loan in the sample. See “Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for a table that provides the risk category of loans by applicable class of loans. Non-Performing Loans and Assets Information summarizing non-performing assets, including non-accrual loans follows. December 31, 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Non-accrual loans $ 3,258 $ 4,817 $ 1,464 $ 2,078 $ 2,695 Troubled debt restructurings 1,832 1,928 2,717 1,391 1,206 Loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing 1,380 3,296 38 214 231 Non-performing loans 3,258 4,817 1,464 2,078 2,695 Foreclosed real estate 266 523 1,044 988 — Non-performing assets $ 3,524 $ 5,340 $ 2,508 $ 3,066 $ 2,695 Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.17 % 0.25 % 0.10 % 0.15 % 0.28 % Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.11 % 0.18 % 0.12 % 0.16 % 0.20 % 53 The balance of non-performing assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. We have established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on loans (that is, place the loans on non-accrual status) after they have become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loans are considered to be well-collateralized and are in the process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In addition, a loan will not be placed on non-accrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of all principal and interest is not expected in a timely manner. Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against interest income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. If we believe that a loan will not be collected in full, we will increase the allowance for loan losses to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied directly to principal. As of December 31, 2021, there were not any loans, outside of those included in the table above, that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with present repayment terms. Due to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. The effect of these changes is assessed to determine if the loan should be classified as a Troubled Debt Restructure. Loans that have been restructured that are on non-accruing status as of the date of restructuring, are included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and are classified as impaired loans. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired. Allowance for Loan Losses (allowance) Our allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above and in Notes 1 and 4 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” While no portion of our allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following tables represent management’s allocation of our allowance to specific loan categories for the periods indicated. December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate $ 7,124 32.8 % $ 7,349 31.6 % $ 3,599 28.6 % $ 3,309 27.3 % $ 3,324 24.2 % Consumer real estate 2,412 11.1 % 1,831 7.9 % 1,231 9.8 % 1,005 8.3 % 1,063 7.7 % Construction and land development 3,769 17.4 % 3,476 15.0 % 2,058 16.3 % 2,431 20.1 % 1,628 11.9 % Commercial and industrial 7,441 34.3 % 9,708 41.8 % 5,074 40.3 % 5,036 41.6 % 7,209 52.5 % Consumer 397 1.8 % 305 1.3 % 222 1.8 % 105 0.9 % 91 0.7 % Other 555 2.6 % 576 2.5 % 420 3.3 % 227 1.9 % 406 3.0 % Total allowance for loan and lease losses $ 21,698 100.0 % $ 23,245 100.0 % $ 12,604 100.0 % $ 12,113 100.0 % $ 13,721 100.0 % Changes in the allocation of the allowance from year to year in various categories are influenced by the level of net charge-offs in respective categories and other factors including, but not limited to, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and trends, risk allocations tied to specific loans or groups of loans and changes in qualitative allocations. Management believes that allocations for each loan category are reasonable and reflective of risk inherent in the portfolio. 54 Deposits Client deposits are the primary funding source for our loan growth. The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on deposits for each of the following categories for the periods indicated. Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Types of Deposits: Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 725,075 0.00 % $ 558,416 0.00 % $ 315,031 0.00 % Interest-bearing transaction accounts 955,553 0.17 % 744,144 0.52 % 499,468 1.51 % Money market accounts 451,947 0.23 % 463,183 1.10 % 444,685 1.62 % Savings accounts 142,705 0.11 % 86,350 0.11 % 49,902 0.08 % Time deposits 417,770 0.69 % 407,224 1.31 % 361,956 2.08 % Total deposits $ 2,693,050 0.21 % $ 2,259,317 0.64 % $ 1,671,042 1.34 % Total average deposits increased 19.2% in 2021 compared to 2020 and increased 35.2% in 2020 compared to 2019. Much of the growth in deposits in 2020 is related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW. However, we have been able to increase average noninterest-bearing demand deposits each year as we focus on building and expanding client relationships and delivering on our core deposit-led strategy. The Target Market is an already competitive market, which has been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants. The maturities of time deposits that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250 thousand at December 31, 2021 are as follows ($ in thousands): December 31, 2021 Three months or less Over three through six months Over six through twelve months Over twelve months Total Time deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit $ 18,005 $ 14,908 $ 14,209 $ 8,249 $ 55,371 Capital Adequacy As of December 31, 2021, CapStar Financial’s capital ratios were as follows.

Market and Liquidity Risk Management Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of our established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our ALCO is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure an acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. Interest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis Managing interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity while attempting to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer requirements. 55 We use earnings at risk, or EAR, simulations to assess the impact of changing rates on earnings under a variety of scenarios and time horizons. The simulation model is designed to reflect the dynamics of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments. These simulations utilize both instantaneous and parallel changes in the level of interest rates, as well as gradual and non-parallel changes such as changing slopes and twists of the yield curve. Static simulation models are based on current exposures and assume a constant balance sheet with no growth. By estimating the effects of interest rate increases and decreases, the model can reveal approximate interest rate risk exposure. The simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in interest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and does not indicate actual expected results. At December 31, 2021, our EAR static simulation results indicated that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to parallel shifts in interest rates. This indicates that our assets generally reprice faster than our liabilities, which results in a favorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates increase and an unfavorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates decline. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity, and key rate drivers. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may, and most likely will, differ from our static EAR results. In addition, static EAR results do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client behavior. For example, as part of our asset/liability management strategy, management has the ability to increase asset duration and/or decrease liability duration in order to reduce asset sensitivity, or to decrease asset duration and/or increase liability duration in order to increase asset sensitivity. The following table illustrates the results of our EAR analysis to determine the extent to which our net interest income over the next 12 months would change if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts. Net interest income change Increase 200bp 4.6% Increase 100bp 1.9 Decrease 100bp (3.9) Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. To manage liquidity risk, management has established a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is fully integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; appropriate strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems (including assessments of the current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are commensurate with the complexity and business activities of the Bank; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; adequate levels of highly liquid marketable securities free of legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that can be used to meet liquidity needs in stressful situations; comprehensive contingency funding plans that sufficiently address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes sufficient to determine the adequacy of the institution’s liquidity risk management process. The role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors’ withdrawal and borrowers’ credit demands while at the same time optimizing financial results within our corporate guidelines. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of those funds. Liquidity is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, investment securities available-for-sale, various lines of credit available to us, and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally deposits. Our most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, available-for-sale marketable investment securities and federal funds sold. The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was $459.4 million at December 31, 2021. We pledge portions of our investment securities portfolio to secure public fund deposits, derivative positions and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. At December 31, 2021, total investment securities pledged for these purposes comprised 41% of the estimated fair value of the entire investment portfolio, leaving $272.5 million of unpledged securities. 56 We have a large base of non-maturity customer deposits, defined as demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts. At December 31, 2021, such deposits totaled $2.3 billion and represented 86% of our total deposits. Other sources of funds available to meet daily needs include FHLB advances. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, the Company has access to credit products offered by the FHLB. At December 31, 2021, available credit from the FHLB totaled $154.4 million. Additionally, we had available credit from the Federal Reserve of $244.8 million and available federal funds purchased lines with correspondent banks totaling $145.0 million at December 31, 2021. The principal source of cash for CapStar Financial is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. At December 31, 2021, the Bank was able to pay up to $82.5 million in dividends to CapStar Financial without regulatory approval subject to the ongoing capital requirements of the Bank. Accordingly, management believes that our funding sources are at sufficient levels to satisfy our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Contractual Obligations The following table presents additional information about contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021, which by their terms have contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2021.

We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our clients. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit as well as commitments to extend credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold. We enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon clients maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. In the event that the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the client. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. We minimize our exposure to loss under loan commitments and standby letters of credit by subjecting them to the same credit approval and monitoring procedures as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses. The effect on our revenue, expenses, cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. 57 Our off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated. Contract or notional amount December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 831,075 $ 804,520 $ 672,933 Standby letters of credit 10,623 10,403 9,634 Total $ 841,698 $ 814,923 $ 682,567 Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Report includes the following financial measures that have been prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“non-GAAP financial measures”): tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets, tangible common equity per share and allowance for loan losses plus fair value purchase accounting marks to non-PPP loans. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enable a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business, and (iii) allow investors to evaluate the Company’s performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators; however, the Company acknowledges that its non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. The following table presents a reconciliation of tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible book value per share of common stock to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Impact of Inflation The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. ITEM 7A.

FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page(s) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm- Financial Statements [PCAOB ID 149 ] 61 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm - Internal Control over Financial Reporting [PCAOB ID 149] 63 Consolidated Financial Statements: Consolidated Balance Sheets 64 Consolidated Statements of Income 65 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 66 Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity 67 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 68 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 69 60 Report of Independent Re gistered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 4, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Loan Losses As described in Note 4 to the Company’s financial statements, the Company has a gross loan portfolio of approximately $1.97 billion and related allowance for loan losses of approximately $21.7 million as of December 31, 2021. As described by the Company in Note 1, the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis and is based upon the Company’s review of the collectability of the loans in light of peer group historical loss experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. 61 We identified the Company’s estimate of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter related to the high degree of subjectivity in the Company’s judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions by the Company involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: We have served as the Company's auditor since 2017. /s/ Elliott Davis, LLC Franklin, Tennessee March 4, 2022 62 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc.: Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary's (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, change in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 of the Company and our report dated March 4, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Elliott Davis, LLC Franklin, Tennessee March 4, 2022 63 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOL DINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Consolidated B alance Sheets (Dollars in

FINANCIAL H OLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021and 2020 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 include CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and it’s wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank (the “Bank”, together referred to as the “Company”). Significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Under this method, all identifiable assets acquired, including purchased loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The Company typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of shares of common stock issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition. Nature of Operations Through the Bank, the Company provides full banking services to consumer and corporate customers located primarily in Tennessee. The Bank operates under a state bank charter and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a state member bank, the Bank is subject to regulations of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Reclassifications Certain amounts, previously reported, have been reclassified to state all periods on a comparable basis and had no effect on shareholders' equity or net income. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, determination of impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, the valuation of our investment portfolio and deferred tax assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds sold are purchased and sold for one-day periods. The Company maintains deposits in excess of the federal insurance amounts with other financial institutions. Management makes deposits only with financial institutions it considers to be financially sound. 69 Securities The Bank accounts for securities under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities . Under the provisions of FASB ASC 320, securities are to be classified in three categories and accounted for as follows: Securities Held-to-Maturity - Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity securities when the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Trading Securities - Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. No securities have been classified as trading securities. Securities Available-for-Sale - Debt securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities. Securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Realized gains and losses from the sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific-identification method. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and any collateral underlying the relevant security. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: (1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and (2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. 70 Loans Held For Sale and Fair Value Option The Company classifies loans as loans held for sale when originated with the intent to sell. As of April 1, 2019, the Company elected the fair value option for all residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. This election allows for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. The Company has not elected the fair value option for other loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using derivative instruments. The fair value of residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell is based on traded market prices of similar assets. Other loans held for sale, such as SBA loans or Tri-Net loans, that are recorded at lower of cost or fair value may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when the fair value is less than cost. No SBA loans or Tri-Net loans were measured at fair value as of December 31, 2021. For further information, see Note 23 - Fair Value. The Company does not securitize mortgage loans. If the Company sells loans with servicing rights retained, the carrying value of the mortgage loan sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. The changes in fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income and included gains (losses) of ($ 2.5 ) million, $ 2.5 million, and $ 0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively . The following table summarizes the difference between the fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for residential real estate loans held for sale as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands): Fair Value Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance Difference December 31, 2021 Residential mortgage loans held for sale $ 37,306 $ 36,755 $ 550 December 31, 2020 Residential mortgage loans held for sale 97,303 94,248 3,055 Tri-Net Fees Tri-Net fees are derived from the origination of commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Realized gains and losses are recognized when legal title of the loan has transferred to the investor and sales proceeds have been received and are reflected in the accompanying statements of income in Tri-Net fees, net of related costs such as commission expenses. Loans that have not been sold at period end are classified as held for sale on the balance sheet and recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. Loans The Company has seven classes of loans for financial reporting purposes: commercial real estate, consumer real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, consumer, PPP, and other. The appropriate classification is determined based on the underlying collateral utilized to secure each loan. Commercial real estate includes both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties. The repayment of owner-occupied properties is largely dependent on the operations of the tenant, while non-owner occupied properties is dependent upon the refinance or sale of the underlying real estate. Consumer real estate consists primarily of 1-4 family residential properties including home equity lines of credit. Construction and land development loans include loans where the repayment is dependent on the successful completion and operation and/or sale of the related real estate project. Construction and land development loans include 1-4 family construction projects and commercial construction endeavors such as warehouses, apartments, office and retail space and land acquisition and development. Commercial and industrial loans include loans to business enterprises issued for commercial, industrial and/or other professional purposes. 71 Consumer loans include all loans issued to individuals not included in the consumer real estate class. PPP loans originated through the CARES act and include partially, or fully forgivable loans used to cover payroll costs, rent, interest, utilities, and other qualifiable expenses. Other loans include all loans not included in the classes of loans above and leases. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest is typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful and collection is highly questionable. Amortization of deferred loan fees is discontinued when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Under the cash-basis method, interest income is recorded when the payment is received in cash. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Loans can also be returned to accrual status when they become well secured and in the process of collection. Acquired Loans Acquired loans are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on assumptions regarding the amount and timing of principal and interest payments, estimated prepayments, estimated default rates, estimated loss severity in the event of defaults, and current market rates. Estimated credit losses are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded on the acquisition date. An acquired loan is considered purchased credit impaired when there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually or aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics such as loan type and risk rating. The Company estimates the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan or pool, and the expected cash flows in excess of amount paid (fair value) is recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool (accretable yield). The excess of the loan’s or pool’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (nonaccretable difference). Over the life of the loan or pool, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded as a provision for loan losses. If the present value of expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income. Acquired non-impaired loans are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisioning that may be required. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is maintained at a level that management believes to be adequate to absorb expected loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Quarterly, the Company estimates the allowance required using peer group loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. The Company’s historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions due to the Company’s 72 limited loss history. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The Company also considers the results of the external independent loan review when assessing the adequacy of the allowance and incorporates relevant loan review results in the loan impairment and overall adequacy of allowance determinations. Furthermore, regulatory agencies periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to record adjustments to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. Additional considerations are included in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance based on the continuous review conducted by relationship managers and credit department personnel. The Company’s loan policy requires that each customer relationship wherein total exposure exceeds $ 1.5 million be subject to a formal credit review at least annually. Should these reviews identify potential collection concerns, appropriate adjustments to the allowance may be made. The allowance consists of specific and general components as discussed below. While the allowance consists of separate components, these terms are primarily used to describe a process. Both portions of the allowance are available to provide for inherent losses in the entire portfolio. Specific Component The specific component relates to loans that are individually determined to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans meeting any of the following criteria are individually evaluated for impairment: risk rated substandard (as defined in Note 4), on non-accrual status or past due greater than 90 days. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral less costs to sell if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Changes to the valuation allowance are recorded as a component of the provision for loan losses. TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. TDRs are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s effective rate at inception. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. General Component The general component of the allowance for loan losses covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Large groups of homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. The general allowance component also includes loans that are individually identified for impairment evaluation but are not considered impaired. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. Due to the Company’s limited loss history, the historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions. The Company utilized a 41 quarter look-back period as of December 31, 2019. Subsequently, the Company increased its look-back period to a total of 45 quarters and 49 quarters as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period was necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. This extension of the historical 73 look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio. The actual loss experience is supplemented with other environmental factors that capture changes in trends, conditions, and other relevant factors that may cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from historical loss experience. The allocation for environmental factors is by nature subjective. These amounts represent estimated probable inherent credit losses, which exist but have not been captured in the historical loss experience. The environmental factors include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans, quality of the loan review system, value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations, and other external factors. Servicing Rights When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in other noninterest income. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported with other noninterest income on the income statement and the associated asset is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement within other noninterest income, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal; or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income. Net servicing fees totaled $ 555,000 , $ 689,000 , and $ 377,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. Valuation adjustments associated with these servicing rights amounted to $ 77,000 , ($ 238,000 ) and ($ 211,000 ) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method based on the shorter of the asset lives or the expected lease terms. Useful lives for premises and equipment range from one to thirty-nine years . These assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)), which requires for all operating leases the recognition of a right-of-use (""ROU"") asset and a corresponding lease liability, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For short term leases (term of 12 months or less), a lessee is permitted to make an accounting election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The lease cost will be allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. There were further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01, “Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842” in January 2018. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, ""Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements"", which provides for the option to apply the new leasing standard to all open leases as of the adoption date, on a prospective basis. 74 Bank Owned Life Insurance The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Bank owned life insurance is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase The Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase at a specified future date. Such repurchase agreements are considered financing arrangements and, accordingly, the obligation to repurchase assets sold is reflected as a liability in the balance sheets of the Bank. Repurchase agreements are collateralized by debt securities which are owned and under the control of the Bank and are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. Qualitative factors are assessed to first determine if it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2021, qualitative factors indicated it was more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill was less than fair value, thus there were no indicators of impairment and no quantitative testing was performed. For the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company determined it did not satisfy the more likely than not qualitative assessment that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. As a result, the Company elected to perform a quantitative assessment, which included a combination of quoted market prices of the Company’s stock, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other techniques. Based upon the results of the quantitative assessment, the Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, resulting in no impairment. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the balance sheet. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to ten years . Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned (“OREO”) includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and are recorded at estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Valuation adjustments required at foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, additional losses resulting from the periodic revaluation of the property are charged to other real estate expense. Costs of operating and maintaining the properties and any gains or losses recognized on disposition are also included in other real estate expense. Improvements made to properties are capitalized if the expenditures are expected to be recovered upon the sale of the properties. Restricted Equity Securities The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based upon the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on an assessment of the ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System, and as such, holds stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“Federal Reserve Bank”). Federal Reserve Bank stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income. 75 Income Taxes Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company’s tax returns remain open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS and various states for the years ended December 31, 2018 through 2021. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest, reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with performance vesting criteria, anticipated performance is projected to determine the number of awards expected to vest, and the corresponding aggregate expense is adjusted to reflect the elapsed portion of the performance period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $ 758,000 , $ 400,000 and $ 370,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively and is included in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance-sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received. Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps (“swaps”) to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these arrangements to meet customer needs, the Bank enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize market risk to the Bank. These swaps are derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments. The Bank may also utilize cash flow hedges to manage its future interest rate exposure. These derivative contracts are designated as hedges and, as such, changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Bank prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges. The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness, along with support for management’s assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion, if any, would be recognized in current period earnings. 76 The Bank discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended. When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as non-interest income. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. Cash flows resulting from the derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as hedges are classified in the cash flow statement in the same category as the cash flows of the items being hedged. Commitments to fund mortgage loans “interest rate locks” to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the sale of mortgage-backed securities are accounted for as free standing derivatives. The fair value of the interest rate lock is recorded at the time the commitment to fund the mortgage loan is executed and is adjusted for the expected exercise of the commitment before the loan is funded. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest rate on the loan is locked. The Company enters into forward commitments for the sale of mortgage-backed securities when interest rate locks are entered into, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in mortgage banking income. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on securities transferred to held to maturity and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges which are also recognized as separate components of equity. The Bank’s policy is to release the income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when the item is realized. Fair Value Measurements Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Restriction on Cash Balances Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Act requires that banks maintain reserve balances with their applicable Federal Reserve Bank based principally on the type and amount of their deposits. On March 15, 2020, the Board of the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020. This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions. Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure through March 4, 2022, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Income Per Common Share Basic net income per share available to common stockholders (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is attributable to convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of outstanding convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. No antidilutive stock options were excluded from calculation for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. 77 The following is a summary of the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation for each of the following years (in thousands except share data): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Basic net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 48,677 $ 24,696 $ 22,422 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 22,127,919 20,162,038 17,886,164 Basic net income per share $ 2.20 $ 1.22 $ 1.25 Diluted net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 48,677 $ 24,696 $ 22,422 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 22,127,919 20,162,038 17,886,164 Dilutive shares contingently issuable 51,542 23,551 727,060 Average diluted common shares outstanding 22,179,461 20,185,589 18,613,224 Diluted net income per share $ 2.19 $ 1.22 $ 1.20 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities. The amendments were originally supposed to be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for all organizations for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. However, in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates , which finalizes effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying the credit losses standard. The Company is not required to adopt this standard until January 1, 2023. The Company has established a Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) Steering Committee which includes the appropriate members of management to evaluate the impact this ASU will have on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. Additionally, the Company selected a third-party vendor to provide allowance for loan loss software as well as advisory services in developing a new methodology and a parallel model. ASU 2019-05 ― Applicable to entities that hold financial instruments: In May 2019, the FASB issued guidance to provide entities with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments will be effective for the Company upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 in fiscal year 2023. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. ASU 2019-12 ― Applicable to entities within the scope of Topic 740, Income Taxes: In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing specific technical exceptions that often produce information investors have a hard time understanding. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. These amendments did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. ASU 2020-04 ― Applicable to entities within the scope of Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform: In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company continues to implement its transition plan towards cessation of LIBOR and the modification of its outstanding financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly 78 influenced by LIBOR. The Company expects to utilize the LIBOR transition relief allowed under ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01, as applicable, and does not expect such adoption to have a material impact on its accounting and disclosures. The Company will continue to assess the impact as the reference rate transition approaches June 30, 2023. ASU 2021-06 ― Applicable to entities within the scope of Topic 245, Presentation of Financial Statements, Topic 942, Financial Services- Depository and Lending, and Topic 946, Financial Services- Investment Companies: This guidance updated the FASB Codification pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, which was effective January 1, 2021, and SEC Release No. 33-10835, Update to Statistical Disclosures for Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants which applied to fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2021-06 did not have a material impact on its disclosures. 79 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 2 – ACQUISITIONS FCB Merger Effective July 1, 2020, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Acquisition dated as of January 23, 2020 (the “FCB Acquisition Agreement”), by and between the Company and FCB Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (“FCB”), FCB was acquired by CapStar, with CapStar continuing as the surviving entity (the “FCB Acquisition”).

Total acquisition consideration amounted to approximately $ 70.9 million. With the acquisitions, the Company further expanded its franchise in the Middle Tennessee market. FCB’s and BOW’s results of operations were included in the Company’s results beginning July 1, 2020. Acquisition related costs of $ 5.4 million are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The fair value of the common shares issued as part of the consideration paid for the Acquisitions was determined by the closing price of the Company’s common shares immediately preceding the acquisition date. 80 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill of $ 3.6 million associated with the Acquisitions is not amortizable for book or tax purposes.

The amount of the impairment of available for sale securities related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The unrealized losses shown above are primarily due to increases in market rates over the yields available at the time of purchase of the underlying securities and not credit quality. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2021. There were no other-than-temporary impairments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019 . NOTE 4 – LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES Loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Commercial real estate $ 825,284 $ 643,832 Consumer real estate 326,412 343,791 Construction and land development 214,310 174,859 Commercial and industrial 497,615 623,446 Consumer 46,811 44,279 Other 55,337 53,483 Total 1,965,769 1,883,690 Allowance for loan losses ( 21,698 ) ( 23,245 ) Total loans, net $ 1,944,071 $ 1,860,445 The CARES Act created a new guaranteed, unsecured loan program under the SBA called the Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”), which the Company participates in, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the pandemic period. The SBA has guaranteed 100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP by lenders to eligible small businesses. One of the notable features of the PPP is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if certain conditions are met related to retaining staff and if loan amounts are used to cover eligible expenses, such as payroll, mortgage interest, rents and utilities payments. These loans have a two-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1 %. The outstanding balances of loans originated under the PPP as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $ 26.5 million and $ 185.5 million, respectively, and were included in commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, PPP borrowers are not required to pay any fees to the government or the lender and the loans may be repaid by the borrower at any time. The SBA, however, will pay lenders a processing fee based on the size of the PPP loan, ranging from 1 % to 5 % of the loan. Unamortized fees associated with PPP loans included in total loans were $ 0.6 million and $ 4.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. These fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan. PPP fees recognized as income totaled $ 7.2 million and $ 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is assessed at the end of each quarter. The ALL includes a specific component related to loans that are individually evaluated for impairment and a general component related to loans that are segregated into homogenous pools and collectively evaluated for impairment. The ALL factors applied to these pools are an estimate of probable incurred losses based on management’s evaluation of historical net losses from loans with similar characteristics, which are adjusted by management to reflect current events, trends, and conditions. The adjustments include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans, quality of the loan review system, value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations, and other external factors. The Company’s evaluation of other external factors included consideration of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic and the resulting impact on the Company’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, which is uncertain due to evolving conditions and unforeseen new variants. 84 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements At December 31, 2021 , variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $ 881,072,000 and $ 1,084,697,000 , respectively. At December 31, 2020 , variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $ 1,199,105,000 and $ 691,914,000 , respectively. The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes all commercial loans, and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $ 500,000 , individually and assigns each loan a risk rating. This analysis is performed on a continual basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least an annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the loan’s risk rating. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention – A special mention asset possesses deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving of management’s attention. If uncorrected, such weaknesses or deficiencies may expose the Company to an increased risk of loss in the future. Substandard – A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. Doubtful – A doubtful asset has all weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is extremely high, but certain important and reasonable specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset exist, therefore, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined.

The Company did no t allocate a specific allowance for those loans at December 31, 2021 or 2020 and there were no commitments to lend additional amounts. Loans accounted for as TDR include modifications from original terms such as those due to bankruptcy proceedings, certain modifications of amortization periods or extended suspension of principal payments due to customer financial difficulties. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company’s loan policy. Loans accounted for as TDR are individually evaluated for impairment. In accordance with interagency guidance, short term deferrals granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic are not considered TDRs unless the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty prior to the pandemic. There were no new TDR loans identified during the year ended December 31, 2021 .

Acquired Loans On July 1, 2020, the Company acquired FCB and BOW (see Note 2 for more information). As a result of the acquisitions, the Company recorded loans with a fair value of $ 294.7 million. Of those loans, $ 33.6 million were considered to be purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are loans for which it is probable at the acquisition date that all contractually required payments will not be collected. The remaining loans are considered to be purchased non-impaired loans and their related fair value discount or premium is recognized as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of each loan. The following table relates to acquired FCB and BOW PCI loans and summarizes the contractually required payments, which includes principal and interest, expected cash flows to be collected, and the fair value of acquired PCI loans at the acquisition date (in thousands): FCB and BOW acquired on July 1, 2020 Contractually required payments $ 42,443 Nonaccretable difference 4,501 Cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition 37,942 Accretable yield 4,349 Fair value of PCI loans at acquisition date $ 33,593 90 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following table relates to acquired FCB and BOW purchased non-impaired loans and provides the contractually required payments, fair value, and estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected at the acquisition date (in thousands): FCB and BOW acquired on July 1, 2020 Contractually required payments $ 296,527 Fair value of acquired loans at acquisition date 260,701 Contractual cash flows not expected to be collected 3,718 The following table presents changes in the carrying value of PCI loans (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2021 For the year ended December 31, 2020 For the year ended December 31, 2019 Balance at beginning of period $ 28,392 $ 1,605 $ 1,620 Additions due to the acquisitions — 33,593 — Change due to payments received and accretion ( 8,940 ) ( 6,806 ) ( 15 ) Reclassification of discount to allowance for loan losses ( 191 ) — — Balance at end of period $ 19,261 $ 28,392 $ 1,605 The following table presents changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2021 For the year ended December 31, 2020 For the year ended December 31, 2019 Balance at beginning of period $ 4,068 $ 915 $ 440 Additions due to the acquisitions — 4,349 — Accretion ( 1,987 ) ( 1,196 ) ( 570 ) Reclassification from nonaccretable difference 1,519 — 1,045 Other changes, net 2,163 — — Balance at end of period $ 5,763 $ 4,068 $ 915 PCI loans had a $ 0.2 million impact on the ALL for the year ended December 31, 2021 and no impact on the ALL for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019 .

NOTE 7 – LEASES The Company leases certain premises and equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates, through 2032 , and in most instances, include options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. At December 31, 2021 , the Company had lease liabilities totaling $ 11.9 million and right-of-use assets totaling $ 11.1 million related to these leases. Lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are reflected in other liabilities and other assets, respectively. At December 31, 2021 , the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was 9.1 years and the weighted average discount rate used in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was 3.5 %. Lease costs were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Operating lease cost $ 2,102 $ 1,946 Short-term lease cost — — Variable least cost — — Total lease cost $ 2,102 $ 1,946 There were no sale and leaseback transactions, leveraged leases, or lease transactions with related parties during the year ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. The Company has entered into an agreement for a real estate lease associated with the Chattanooga expansion that is not recorded as a right-of-use asset or lease liability as the Company has not yet taken possession as of December 31, 2021. The lease is expected to commence in 2022 with undiscounted future payments of $ 597,000 . 92 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements A maturity analysis of operating lease liabilities and reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to the total operating lease liability is as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2021 Lease payments due: 2022 $ 1,751 2023 1,717 2024 1,426 2025 1,393 2026 1,308 2027 and thereafter 6,239 Total undiscounted cash flows (a) 13,834 Discount on cash flows ( 1,941 ) Total lease liability $ 11,893 (a) Operating lease payments exclude $ 0.6 million of legally binding minimum lease payments related to the Chattanooga lease signed, but not yet commenced. NOTE 8 – GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill The change in goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in thousands): 2021 2020 Beginning of year $ 41,068 $ 37,510 Acquired goodwill — 3,558 Impairment — — End of year $ 41,068 $ 41,068 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. Qualitative factors are assessed to first determine if it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2021, qualitative factors indicated it was more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill was less than fair value, thus there were no indicators of impairment and no quantitative testing was performed. For the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company determined it did not satisfy the more likely than not qualitative assessment that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. As a result, the Company elected to perform a quantitative assessment, which included a combination of quoted market prices of the Company’s stock, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other techniques. Based upon the results of the quantitative assessment, the Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, resulting in no impairment. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the balance sheet. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to ten years . 93 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Acquired Intangible Assets Acquired intangible assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Amortized intangible assets: Core deposit intangibles $ 12,837 $ ( 6,146 ) $ 12,837 $ ( 4,207 ) For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , amortization expense was $ 1.9 million, $ 1.8 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 0.8 million related to the permanent tax rate benefit of Net Operating Loss carrybacks as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act""). Significant items that gave rise to deferred taxes at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 4,863 $ 5,040 Net operating loss carryforward 422 527 Organization and preopening costs 158 261 Stock-based compensation 152 48 Acquired loans 769 939 Accrued contributions 297 288 Acquired deposits 214 459 Accrued compensation 2,670 3,159 Deferred loan fees 1,004 — Unrealized loss on securities available for sale 1,161 — Other 215 148 Deferred tax assets 11,925 10,869 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation 1,563 1,633 Goodwill 465 311 Unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale — 2,009 Amortization of core deposit intangible 1,136 1,608 Other acquired assets 337 509 Other 449 201 Deferred tax liabilities 3,950 6,271 Net deferred tax asset $ 7,975 $ 4,598 At December 31, 2021, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 2.0 million, which expire at various dates from 2030 to 2032 . Deferred tax assets are fully recognized because the benefits are more likely than not to be realized based on management's estimation of future taxable earnings. 97 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements There were no significant unrecognized income tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax penalties. NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for instruments that are included in the balance sheet. The following table sets forth outstanding financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): Contract or notional amount December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 831,075 $ 804,520 Standby letters of credit 10,623 10,403 Total $ 841,698 $ 814,923 The Company is party to litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from such litigation and claims as of December 31, 2021 , will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company. NOTE 15 – CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Substantially all of the Company’s loans, commitments, and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Company’s market areas. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4 to the financial statements. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 , the Company’s cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions aggregated $ 358.8 million and $ 243.2 million, respectively, in excess of insured limits. NOTE 16 – REGULATORY MATTERS AND RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the Bank is also subject to the regulatory capital requirements of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory – and possibly additional discretionary – actions by regulators that could, in that event, have a material adverse effect on the institutions’ financial statements. The relevant regulations require the Company and the Bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting principles. The capital classifications of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by their regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Those qualitative judgments could also affect the capital status of the Company and the Bank and the amount of dividends the Company and the Bank may distribute. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. Banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of December 31, 2021, the Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, federal banking regulators have established five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are 98 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company and the Bank were well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There have been no conditions or events subsequent to December 31, 2021 that management believes have changed the Company’s or the Bank’s category. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table (dollars in thousands): Actual Minimum capital requirement (1) Minimum to be well-capitalized (2) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio At December 31, 2021: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 384,116 16.29 % $ 188,610 8.0 % N/A N/A CapStar Bank 370,919 15.74 188,471 8.0 235,589 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 332,567 14.11 141,458 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 348,902 14.81 141,354 6.0 188,471 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 332,567 14.11 106,093 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 332,402 14.11 106,015 4.5 153,133 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 332,567 10.69 124,437 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 348,902 11.23 124,246 4.0 155,308 5.0 At December 31, 2020: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 338,426 16.03 % $ 168,910 8.0 % N/A N/A CapStar Bank 324,152 15.36 168,808 8.0 211,010 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 285,439 13.52 126,682 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 300,588 14.25 126,606 6.0 168,808 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 285,439 13.52 95,012 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 284,088 13.46 94,954 4.5 137,156 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 285,439 9.60 118,877 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 300,588 10.12 118,780 4.0 148,476 5.0 (1) For the calendar year 2021, the Company was required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of Tier 1 common equity capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 2.5 % to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees. (2) For the Company to be well-capitalized, the Bank must be well-capitalized and the Company must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 99 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Under Tennessee banking law, the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions is limited to the current year’s net income, combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. The Bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that Company holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Based on these regulations, the Bank was eligible to pay $ 82.5 million and $ 49.6 million of dividends as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The Bank paid the Company $ 5.2 million of dividends during 2021. NOTE 17 – NONVOTING AND SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCK WARRANTS Nonvoting Common Stock The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of its common stock as nonvoting common stock. The nonvoting common stock has the same rights and privileges as the common stock other than the nonvoting designation. Under certain conditions, as outlined in the Company’s charter, the nonvoting stock may be converted, on a one-to-one basis , to common stock. In conjunction with the Company’s initial public offering, 79,166 shares of nonvoting common stock were issued and simultaneously converted to common stock on a one-to-one basis. During 2019, 132,561 shares of nonvoting common stock were converted to common stock. As a result, at December 31, 2021 , there were no shares of nonvoting common stock outstanding. Preferred Stock In conjunction with its initial capital issuance in 2008, the Bank issued 1,609,756 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to certain shareholders. During 2016, coinciding with the Company’s initial public offering, 731,707 preferred shares were converted to common shares. During 2019, 878,048 preferred shares were converted to common shares. As a result, at December 31, 2021 , there was no Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. NOTE 18 – STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES On April 23, 2021, the shareholders of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. approved the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the ""Plan""), which replaced the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of stock-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance awards and restricted stock, to employees, directors and service providers that are subject to forfeiture until vesting conditions have been satisfied by the award recipient under the terms of the award. The Plan is intended to help align the interests of employees and our shareholders and reward our employees for improved Company performance. The Plan reserved 1,168,543 shares of stock for issuance of stock incentives. Stock incentives include both restricted stock and stock option grants. Total shares issuable under the plan were 1,168,174 at December 31, 2021. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, within salaries and employee benefits for employees, and within other non-interest expense for directors, in the consolidated statements of income as follows (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 1,600 $ 1,223 $ 1,262 Less: deferred tax benefit ( 418 ) ( 320 ) ( 330 ) Reduction of net income $ 1,182 $ 903 $ 932 100 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Stock Units We grant time-vested restricted stock units and performance stock units to certain key employees and directors under our stock award plan. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at the issue date. Awards vest ratably over a two or three-year vesting period depending on the specific award. Performance stock units vest based upon the attainment of certain performance metrics over a three-year cumulative performance period. Certain of these awards are eligible to receive dividend equivalent shares. The grant date fair value of these awards approximates the market value of the shares. For awards based upon the achievement of the performance goals, the awards are earned ratably from 0 % to 188 %. If the performance goals are met at the end of the performance period, the award is adjusted to reflect the Company’s three-year total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to a capital market peer group. This TSR modifier cannot cause the award to exceed the maximum of 188 %. The recipients have the right to vote and receive dividends but cannot sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber the restricted stock until the shares have vested. A summary of the changes in the Company’s nonvested stock awards for 2021 follows: Weighted Average Restricted Grant Date Shares Fair Value Year Ended December 31, 2021 Nonvested at beginning of period 148,414 $ 14.39 Granted 143,591 14.84 Vested ( 91,763 ) 14.99 Forfeited ( 23,222 ) 14.52 Nonvested at end of period 177,020 $ 14.00 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Nonvested at beginning of period 84,697 $ 17.44 Granted 144,557 13.73 Vested ( 76,715 ) 16.50 Forfeited ( 4,125 ) 14.45 Nonvested at end of period 148,414 $ 14.39 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Nonvested at beginning of period 157,616 $ 17.00 Granted 31,683 15.86 Vested ( 83,062 ) 15.93 Forfeited ( 21,540 ) 17.72 Nonvested at end of period 84,697 $ 17.44 As of December 31, 2021 , there was $ 1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 1.7 million, $ 1.0 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively. Stock Options Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Option awards generally have a three year vesting period and a ten year contractual term. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on calculations performed by management using industry data. The expected term of options granted was calculated using the “simplified” method for plain 101 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements vanilla options as permitted under authoritative literature. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted average assumptions as of the grant date. There were no options granted during 2021 or 2020 . The Company granted 50,000 options during 2019. A summary of the activity in stock options for 2021 follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Exercise Contractual Shares Price Term (years) Year Ended December 31, 2021 Outstanding at beginning of period 226,589 $ 11.73 Granted — — Exercised ( 96,344 ) 11.41 Forfeited or expired — — Outstanding at end of period 130,245 $ 11.96 4.9 Fully vested and expected to vest 130,245 $ 11.96 4.9 Exercisable at end of period 113,578 $ 11.54 4.5 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Outstanding at beginning of period 271,202 $ 11.22 Granted — — Exercised ( 24,613 ) 6.75 Forfeited or expired ( 20,000 ) 10.92 Outstanding at end of period 226,589 $ 11.73 3.9 Fully vested and expected to vest 226,589 $ 11.73 3.9 Exercisable at end of period 193,255 $ 11.19 3.1 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Outstanding at beginning of period 507,903 $ 8.66 Granted 50,000 14.84 Exercised ( 286,701 ) 7.33 Forfeited or expired — — Outstanding at end of period 271,202 $ 11.22 4.9 Fully vested and expected to vest 271,086 $ 11.22 4.9 Exercisable at end of period 214,952 $ 10.32 3.8 Information related to stock options during 2021, 2020 and 2019 follows: 2021 2020 2019 Intrinsic value of options exercised $ 821,174 $ 188,662 $ 2,478,086 Cash received from option exercises 1,077,489 105,847 1,930,737 Tax benefit realized from option exercises 148,312 16,524 103,847 Weighted average fair value of options granted — — 5.35 As of December 31, 2021 , there was $ 35,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.4 years. 102 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 19 – EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain senior executives with various expiration dates. Most of the contracts have an option for annual renewal by mutual agreement. The agreements specify that in certain terminating events the Company will be obligated to provide certain benefits and pay each of the senior executives severance based on their annual salaries. These terminating events include termination of employment without “Cause” (as defined in the agreements) or in certain other circumstances specified in the agreements. NOTE 20 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a Retirement Savings 401(k) Plan in which employees may participate. The Company has elected a safe harbor 401(k) plan and as such is required to make an annual contribution of 3 % of the employees’ salaries annually. An employee does not have to contribute to receive the employer contribution. In addition, the Company may make an additional discretionary contribution up to 6 % of the employees’ salaries annually. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , the Company contributed $ 1.0 million, $ 0.8 million and $ 0.9 million respectively, to the 401(k) Plan. The Company also has a Health Reimbursement Plan in place to offset the cost of healthcare deductibles for employees. At the end of the year, up to one-half of the unused balance in the employee’s account will be available for the following year up to a maximum of the deductible for that employee. NOTE 21 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate swap agreements. Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges There were no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2021 or 2020 . The company previously terminated an interest rate swap during 2019, which resulted in a termination fee of $ 1.5 million which continued to be amortized as the corresponding hedged items, consisting of LIBOR-based brokered deposits and FHLB borrowings, were expected to remain outstanding until the initial maturities of the terminated swaps. However, during the year ended December 31, 2020, it was determined that in light of the Company’s surplus liquidity position this funding was expected to be terminated at the next renewal date and thus the previously terminated interest rate swaps which had been designated as cash flow hedges were no longer deemed effective, therefore, remaining unrealized losses of $ 1.9 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income were recognized in net income. There are no unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2021. Other Interest Rate Swaps The Company also enters into swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these transactions the Company enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize risk to the Company. A summary of the Company’s customer related interest rate swaps is as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Notional Estimated Notional Estimated amount fair value amount fair value Interest rate swap agreements: Pay fixed/receive variable swaps $ 54,055 $ ( 1,594 ) $ 59,946 $ ( 2,740 ) Pay variable/receive fixed swaps 54,055 1,594 59,946 2,740 Total $ 108,110 $ — $ 119,892 $ — Mortgage Banking Derivatives The Company enters into various derivative agreements with customers in the form of interest-rate lock commitments which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. The derivatives are valued using a model that utilizes market interest rates and other unobservable inputs. Changes in the fair value of these commitments due to fluctuations in interest rates that are to be originated to our loans held for sale portfolio are economically hedged through the use of forward sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities. The gains and losses arising from this derivative activity 103 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are reflected in current period earnings under mortgage banking income. Interest rate lock commitments are valued using a model with significant unobservable market parameters. Forward sale commitments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable. The net gains (losses) relating to mortgage banking derivative instruments included in mortgage banking income were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended For the year ended For the year ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments $ ( 1,911 ) $ 1,959 $ 648 Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments 466 ( 478 ) ( 148 ) Total $ ( 1,445 ) $ 1,481 $ 500 The amount and fair value of mortgage banking derivatives included in the consolidated balance sheets was as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Notional Estimated Notional Estimated amount fair value amount fair value Included in other assets: Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments $ 50,281 $ 696 $ 88,303 $ 2,607 Included in other liabilities: Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments $ 43,000 $ ( 160 ) $ 87,000 $ ( 626 ) NOTE 22 – RELATED PARTY The Company may enter into loan transactions with certain directors, executive officers, significant shareholders, and their affiliates. Such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Company, and did not, in the opinion of management, involve more than normal credit risk or present other unfavorable features. None of these loans were impaired at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Activity within these loans during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in thousands): Total commitment Total funded commitment Year ended December 31, 2021 Beginning of period $ 18,024 $ 9,782 New commitments/draw downs 1,314 2,896 Repayments ( 8,761 ) ( 4,140 ) End of period $ 10,577 $ 8,538 Year ended December 31, 2020 Beginning of period $ 21,815 $ 10,673 New commitments/draw downs 200 2,798 Repayments ( 3,991 ) ( 3,689 ) End of period $ 18,024 $ 9,782 Deposits from directors, executive officers, significant shareholders and their affiliates at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $ 40.8 million and $ 38.5 million, respectively. 104 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 23 – FAIR VALUE Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2: Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Investment Securities : The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2), using matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded and values debt securities by relying on quoted prices for the specific securities and the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). See below for additional discussion of Level 3 valuation methodologies and significant inputs. The fair values of all securities are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Derivatives-Interest Rate Swaps : The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). The Company’s derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair values of all interest rate swaps are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Impaired Loans : The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the loan policy. Other Real Estate Owned : Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Appraisals may be adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and/or management’s expertise and knowledge of the collateral. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. The Company had no other real estate owned carried at fair value at December 31, 2021 or 2020. 105 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Loans Held For Sale : Loans held for sale are carried at either fair value, if elected, or the lower of cost or fair value on a pool-level basis. Origination fees and costs for loans held for sale recorded at lower of cost or market are capitalized in the basis of the loan and are included in the calculation of realized gains and losses upon sale. Origination fees and costs are recognized in earnings at the time of origination for loans held for sale that are recorded at fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other observable market data, such as outstanding commitments from third party investors (Level 2). Derivatives-Mortgage Loan Interest Rate Lock Commitments : Interest rate lock commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are recorded at fair value, determined as the amount that would be required to settle each derivative instrument at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is derived from the fair value of related mortgage loans, which is based on observable market data and includes the expected net future cash flows related to servicing of the loans. In estimating the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment, the Company assigns a probability to the interest rate lock commitment based on an expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded (a “pull through” rate). The expected pull through rates are applied to the fair value of the unclosed mortgage pipeline, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e., the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Changes to the fair value of interest rate lock commitments are recognized based on interest rate changes, changes in the probability that the commitment will be exercised, and the passage of time. Derivatives-Mortgage-Backed Securities Forward Sales Commitments : The Company utilizes mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments to hedge mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments. Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments are recorded at fair value based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable, resulting in a Level 2 fair value classification. . Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands): Fair value measurements at December 31, 2021 Quoted prices in active Significant markets for other Significant identical observable unobservable Carrying assets inputs inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Securities available-for-sale: U.S. government agency agencies $ 11,503 $ — $ 11,503 $ — State and municipal securities 82,560 — 82,560 — Mortgage-backed securities 293,607 — 293,607 — Asset-backed securities 3,339 — 3,339 — Other debt securities 68,387 — 68,387 — Loans held for sale 37,306 — 37,306 — Derivative assets: Non-hedging derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related 1,594 — 1,594 — Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments 696 — — 696 Liabilities: Derivative liabilities: Non-hedging derivatives: Derivative Liabilities - customer related ( 1,594 ) — ( 1,594 ) — Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments ( 160 ) — ( 160 ) — 106 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fair value measurements at December 31, 2020 Quoted prices in active Significant markets for other Significant identical observable unobservable Carrying assets inputs inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Securities available-for-sale: U.S. government agency agencies $ 16,391 $ — $ 16,391 $ — State and municipal securities 91,928 — 91,928 — Mortgage-backed securities 336,363 — 336,363 — Asset-backed securities 3,193 — 3,193 — Other debt securities 38,340 — 38,340 — Loans held for sale 97,303 97,303 Derivatives: Derivative Liabilities - customer related 2,740 — 2,740 — Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments 2,607 — — 2,607 Liabilities: Derivatives: Derivative Liabilities - customer related ( 2,740 ) — ( 2,740 ) — Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments ( 626 ) — ( 626 ) — The table below presents a reconciliation of all assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands): Mortgage Loan Interest Rate Lock Commitments 2021 2020 Balance of recurring Level 3 assets at January 1st $ 2,607 $ 648 Total gains or losses for the period: Included in mortgage banking income ( 1,911 ) 1,959 Balance of recurring Level 3 assets at December 31st $ 696 $ 2,607 The following table presents quantitative information about recurring Level 3 fair value measurements at December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands).

Federal funds sold clear on a daily basis. For this reason, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. It is not practical to determine the fair value of restricted securities due to restrictions placed on their transferability. In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the fair value of loans is measured using an exit price notion. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models or based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value. Included in other assets are bank owned life insurance and certain interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. For bank owned life insurance, the carrying amount is based on the cash surrender value and is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 109 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated by discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates with similar remaining maturities. The fair value of fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and other borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates, advances and other borrowings with similar remaining maturities. Included in other liabilities are accrued interest payable and certain interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on estimating on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, fixed assets are not considered financial instruments and their value has not been incorporated into the fair value estimates. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOU NTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of December 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting was designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As of December 31, 2021, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in 2013. This assessment included controls over the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on such assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been audited by Elliott Davis LLC, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included on page 63 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, statements relating to the Company’s assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, short and long-term performance goals, prospects, results of operations, strategic initiatives, the benefits, cost and synergies of completed acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing, benefits, costs and synergies of future acquisitions, disposition and other growth opportunities. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “aspire,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “projection,” “forecast,” “roadmap,” “goal,” “target,” “would,” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based upon current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. The inclusion of these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that such expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and that are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date of this Report, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us, our customers, employees, and third-party service providers, and the ultimate extent of the impacts on our business, including on our credit quality, business operations and liquidity, as well as its impact on general economic and financial market conditions, is uncertain. Continued deterioration in general business and economic conditions, or turbulence in domestic or global financial markets could adversely affect CapStar’s revenues and the values of our assets and liabilities, reduce the availability of funding, affect credit quality, and increase stock price volatility. The Company may not capitalize on opportunities to enhance market share in certain markets and the Company’s services may not be generally accepted in new markets; the ability of the Company to meet expectations regarding the benefits, costs, synergies and financial and operational impact of the FCB Corporation (“FCB”) and the Bank of Waynesboro (“BOW”) acquisitions; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits, costs, synergies and financial and operational improvements of the FCB and BOW acquisitions will not be realized or will not be realized as expected; economic conditions (including interest rate environment, government economic and monetary policies, the strength of global financial markets and inflation and deflation) that impact the financial services industry as a whole and/or our business; the concentration of our business in our Target Market and the effect of changes in the economic, political and environmental conditions on this market; increased competition in the financial services industry, locally, regionally or nationally, which may adversely affect pricing and the other terms offered to our clients; an increase in the cost of deposits, loss of deposits or a change in the deposit mix, which could increase our cost of funding; an increase in the costs of capital, which could negatively affect our ability to borrow funds, successfully raise additional capital or participate in strategic acquisition opportunities; our dependence on our management team and board of directors and changes in our management and board composition; our reputation in the community; our ability to execute our strategy to achieve our loan, return on average assets and efficiency ratio goals, hire seasoned bankers, and achieve deposit growth through organic growth and strategic acquisitions; credit risks related to the size of our borrowers and our ability to adequately identify, assess and limit our credit risk; our concentration of large loans to a small number of borrowers as well as to borrowers located within our ii T arget M arket; the significant portion of our loan portfolio that originated during the past two years and therefore may less reliably predict future collectability than older loans; the adequacy of reserves (including our allowance for loan losses) and the appropriateness of our methodology for calculating such reserves; non-performing loans and leases; non-performing assets; charge-offs, non-accruals, troubled debt restructurings, impairments and other credit-related issues; adverse trends in the healthcare service industry, which is an integral component of our Target M arket’s economy and which could adversely affect the business operations of certain of our key borrowers ; our management of risks inherent in our commercial real estate loan portfolio, and the risk of a prolonged downturn in the real estate market, which could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell collateral upon any foreclosure; our inability to realize operating efficiencies and tax savings from the implementation of our strategic plan; governmental legislation and regulation, including changes in the nature and timing of the adoption and effectiveness of new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as amended, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as amended, Basel guidelines, capital requirements, accounting regulation or standards and other applicable laws and regulations; the loss of large depositor relationships, which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources; operational and liquidity risks associated with our business, including liquidity risks inherent in correspondent banking; volatility in interest rates and our overall management of interest rate risk, including managing the sensitivity of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to interest rates, and the impact to our earnings from a change in interest rates; the potential for our Bank’s regulatory lending limits and other factors related to our size to restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy; strategic acquisitions we may undertake to achieve our goals; the sufficiency of our capital, including sources of capital and the extent to which we may be required to raise additional capital to meet our goals; fluctuations in the fair value of our investment securities that are beyond our control; deterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. government and downgrades in Treasury and federal agency securities; potential exposure to fraud, negligence, computer theft and cyber-crime; the adequacy of our risk management framework; our dependence on our information technology and telecommunications systems and the potential for any systems failures or interruptions; threats to and breaches of our information technology systems and data security, including cyber-attacks; our dependence upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data; our ability to adapt to technological change; the financial soundness of other financial institutions; our exposure to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities; our engagement in derivative transactions; our involvement from time to time in legal proceedings and examinations and remedial actions by regulators; our involvement from time to time in litigation or other proceedings instituted by or against shareholders, customers, employees or third parties and the cost of legal fees associated with such litigation or proceedings; the susceptibility of our market to natural disasters and acts of God; and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to remediate any future material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Risk Factors” included in this Report. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Report, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict their occurrence or how they will affect us . MARKET DATA Market data used in this Report has been obtained from government and independent industry sources and publications available to the public, sometimes with a subscription fee, as well as from research reports prepared for other purposes. Industry publications and surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable. The Company did not commission the preparation of any of the sources or publications referred to in this Report. The Company has not independently verified the data obtained from these sources, and, although the Company believes such data to be reliable as of the dates presented, it could prove to be inaccurate. Forward-looking information obtained from these sources is subject to the same qualifications and the additional uncertainties regarding the other forward-looking statements in this Report. iii SUMMARY OF MATERIAL RISKS An investment in our securities involves risks, including those summarized below. For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see Item 1A—Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Business • Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by global pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. • As a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions • Our business and operations are concentrated in our Target Market, and we are more sensitive than our more geographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy. • Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability. • As a bank that focuses on building comprehensive banking relationships with clients, our reputation is critical to our business, and damage to it could have a material adverse effect on us. Credit and Interest Rate Risks • We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients, who may have greater credit risk than larger borrowers. • Our concentration of large loans to a limited number of borrowers may increase our credit risk. • Lack of seasoning of our loan portfolio could increase risk of credit defaults in the future. • We may not be able to adequately assess and limit our credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability. • Repayment of our leveraged loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. • Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. • The healthcare service industry is an integral component of the local economy, and adverse trends in the healthcare service industry could have a material adverse effect on us. • Our commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans. • A prolonged downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and adversely affect our profitability. • Regulatory requirements affecting our loans secured by commercial real estate could limit our ability to leverage our capital and adversely affect our growth and profitability. • We engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral and own the underlying real estate, subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property. • We are subject to risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position that could materially adversely affect our performance. • We have several large depositor relationships, the loss of which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources. • Correspondent banking introduces unique risks, which could affect our liquidity. • Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and our funding sources may be insufficient to fund our future growth. • We are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our profits. • Changes in monetary policy and government responses to adverse economic conditions such as inflation and deflation may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Strategic Risks • Our business strategy includes the continuation of our growth plans, and we could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. • Our bank’s size presents multiple challenges that may restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy, such as our regulatory and internal lending limits and our ability to effectively leverage our infrastructure to implement our business strategy. • Our growth strategy involves strategic acquisitions, and we may not be able to overcome risks associated with such transactions. iii • Our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future to fund such growth, and the unavailability of additional capital on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect us or our growth. Operational Risks • The fair value of our investment securities could fluctuate because of factors outside of our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us. • Deterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and federal agency securities could adversely affect us and our banking operations. • We are subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, other third parties, and our employees. • We may bear costs associated with the proliferation of computer theft and cyber-crime. • Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us. • We depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. • We are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data. • We encounter technological change continually and have fewer resources than certain of our competitors to invest in technological improvements. • We may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions • We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities. • By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk. • We are or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. • Our Target Market is susceptible to floods, tornados and other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God, which may adversely affect our business and operations. • Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation. • Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the Tax Reform Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. • We may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate. • Changes in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our Company’s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory and Compliance Risks • We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our business activities and impose financial requirements, such as minimum capital requirements, and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. • Federal and state regulators periodically examine our business and may require us to remediate adverse examination findings or may take enforcement action against us. • We are subject to numerous fair lending laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. • We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. • Financial reform legislation has, among other things, tightened capital standards, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and resulted in new regulations that are likely to increase our costs of operations. • We are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress. • Our FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase. Risks Related to Our Common Stock • Even though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange. • A future issuance or future issuances of stock could dilute the value of our common stock. • Significant sales of our common stock by certain shareholders could affect the market value of our common stock. iii • We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in our bank, to secure that debt. • The rights of our common shareholders would likely be subordinate to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. • We and our bank are subject to capital and other legal and regulatory requirements which restrict our ability to pay dividends. • We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. General Risks • We are dependent on the services of our management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key personnel or directors may adversely affect our business and operations. iii PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc., a Tennessee corporation, is a bank holding company that is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee and that operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, a Tennessee-chartered state bank. CapStar Bank was incorporated in the State of Tennessee in 2007 and acquired a state charter in 2008 which was accomplished through a de novo application with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (“TDFI”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Upon approval of its charter, CapStar Bank opened for business to the public on July 14, 2008. CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in 2015 and, on February 5, 2016, completed a share exchange with CapStar Bank’s shareholders that resulted in CapStar Bank becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We are a bank that seeks to establish and maintain comprehensive relationships with our clients by delivering customized and creative banking solutions and superior client service. Our products and services include (i) commercial and industrial loans to small and medium sized businesses, (ii) commercial real estate loans, (iii) Mortgage banking products and services, (iv) private banking and wealth management services for the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals; (v) correspondent banking services to meet the needs of Tennessee’s smaller community banks and (vi) various retail and consumer products. Our operations are presently concentrated in Tennessee. As of December 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $3.0 billion, total deposits of $2.6 billion, total net loans of $1.9 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $343.5 million. Core Operating Principles We operate our business in conformity with our core principles which are, in order of priority: • Soundness - We strive to engage in safe and sound banking practices that preserve the asset quality of our balance sheet and protect our deposit base and ensure we maintain capital levels that are considered above “well capitalized” according to regulatory standards. • Profitability - We seek to improve our core profitability metrics through optimal balance sheet management, economies of scale and expanded services. • Strategic Growth - we seek to grow our loans, deposits and net income by building long-term relationships with our customers based on top quality service and leveraging our operating platform to facilitate acquisitive growth. We have historically adhered to these core operating principles, and we intend to continue to emphasize the importance of these principles to the conduct of our business. Acquisitions and Expansion On July 31, 2012, our bank completed its acquisition of American Security Bank and Trust Company (“American Security”), a Tennessee banking corporation headquartered in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Our bank acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of American Security for approximately $15.2 million in total consideration which was comprised of the issuance of approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock of our bank. At the time of the acquisition, American Security had two banking locations in Sumner County, Tennessee. The operations of American Security are included in CapStar Bank’s financial statements beginning on July 31, 2012. On February 3, 2014, CapStar Bank completed its acquisition of Farmington Financial Group, LLC (“Farmington”), a Tennessee limited liability company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Farmington primarily originates residential real estate loans that are sold in the secondary market. The bank acquired all the assets and liabilities of Farmington for approximately $6.4 million in total consideration which was comprised of $3.0 million in cash, 100,000 shares of common stock of our bank and a five year earn-out based on pre-tax income. The operations of Farmington are included in CapStar Bank’s financial statements beginning on February 3, 2014. 1 On October 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Athens Bancshares Corporation (“Athens”), the bank holding company for Athens Federal Community Bank, National Association (“Athens Federal”), headquartered in Athens, Tennessee. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Athens for approximately $92.9 million in total consideration which was primarily comprised of the issuance of approximately 5.2 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of the acquisition, Athens Federal had eight banking locations located throughout the Eastern Tennessee corridor between Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee. The operations of Athens are included in our financial statements beginning October 1, 2018. On July 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of FCB Corporation (“FCB”), the bank holding company for the First National Bank of Manchester.

Our Products and Services Loans General. Through our bank, we offer a broad range of commercial lending products to small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals. Our strategy is to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio in terms of the type of loan product, the type of client and the industries in which our business clients are engaged. Our commercial and industrial lending products include commercial loans, business term loans, equipment financing and lines of credit to a diversified mix of small and medium sized businesses. We offer commercial real estate loans that are collateralized by both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties, as well as interim construction loans. Our consumer lending products include residential first mortgage loans which are typically thereafter sold on the secondary market. We offer second mortgage home equity mortgage loans and other consumer related loans such as loans for automobile or other recreational vehicles, which we maintain on the Bank’s balance sheet. Additionally, we offer lines of credit to facilitate investment opportunities for consumer clients whose financial characteristics support the request. We market our lending products and services to existing clients through our client service. We seek to attract new lending clients through customized and creative lending solutions and competitive pricing. We have banking teams that are specifically dedicated to the markets in which we serve. We believe our industry-specific knowledge, product and local market expertise and engagement increase our profile within these lending verticals, enable us to identify, select and compete for qualified borrowers and attractive financing projects and manage more effectively the potential risks of our loan portfolio. Underwriting. Disciplined underwriting is the foundation of our credit culture. We strive to adhere to thorough underwriting standards and deliver customized and creative loan solutions in a responsive and timely manner. Philosophically, we seek loans that are prudent and desirable, not just “doable.” In considering a loan, we follow the underwriting principles in our loan and credit administration policies which include the following requirements: • receipt of certain financial information, such as financial statements, tax returns and credit reports, to ensure that the potential borrower has sufficient recurring cash flow and liquidity to repay the loan; • determination that the structure of the loan matches the underlying purpose of and repayment source for the loan, the potential borrower’s creditworthiness and the depreciable life of any collateral; • verification that the potential borrower has a demonstrated propensity to repay the loan/the borrower’s indebtedness/etc.; 2 • consideration of the value, liquidity and marketability of the potential borrower’s assets and identifying and evaluating all significant direct and contingent liabilities; and • determination and approval of the rates and fees associated with the potential loan. Except in very limited circumstances in which substantial equity is present, our commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are supported by personal guaranties from the principals of the borrower. In addition, we require our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans to be secured by well- managed income producing property with adequate margins, supported by a history of profitable operations and cash flows, and proven operating stability. Our underwriting processes collaboratively engage our bankers, credit underwriters and portfolio managers in the analysis of each loan request. We manage our credit risks by analyzing metrics in order to maintain a conservative and well-diversified loan portfolio reflective of our assessment of various subsets within our market. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ tiered review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. Concentrations. We are a relationship-oriented, rather than a transaction-based, bank. Accordingly, substantially all of our loans have been made to borrowers located in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 95% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market, and a substantial portion of those loans are considered commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied and non-owner occupied real estate), mortgage loans and construction loans. As such, a substantial majority of our loan portfolio is dependent upon the economic environment of our Target Market. We do have a limited number of loans secured by properties located outside of Tennessee, most of which are made to borrowers who are well-known to us because they are headquartered or reside within Tennessee. In addition, we employ appropriate limits on our overall loan portfolio and requirements with respect to certain types of lending. As a general practice, we operate with an internal guideline limiting loans to any single borrowing relationship to a tiered amount based upon our internal risk rating. Many of our loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2020, our 25 largest borrowing relationships (which may include multiple loans to one borrower or loans to multiple entities that are affiliated due to common ownership) accounted for approximately 13% of our total loan portfolio. Credit Risk Management. Managing credit risk is a process that involves the entire Company. Our strategy for credit risk management includes the disciplined underwriting process described above, adherence to prudent standards, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all loan exposures. Our Chief Credit Officer provides bank-wide credit oversight and regularly reviews the loan portfolio to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. We periodically submit ourselves to review by independent third parties to validate our internal oversight. We strive to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans become delinquent or impaired, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Credit risk management involves a partnership between our lenders and our credit administration group with credit approval processes requiring concurrence of the two. The members of our credit administration group primarily focus their efforts on credit analysis, underwriting and monitoring new credits and providing management reporting to executive management and our board of directors. Based upon size, emerging problem loans are assigned to our special assets process to mitigate the risk of loss. Executive management regularly reviews the status of the watch list and classified assets portfolio as well as the larger credits in the portfolio. Our collections department is also responsible for managing the collection and foreclosure process and the disposal of other real estate owned. Deposits Core deposits are our principal source of funds for use in lending and other general banking purposes. We solicit core deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through relationship-focused marketing. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, time and savings deposits, certificates of deposit and CDARS ® reciprocal products. We do not rely on brokered deposits as a meaningful source of funding. 3 Our ability to gather deposits is an important aspect of our business franchise, and we believe this is a significant driver of our success. Our largest source s of deposits are NOW, Demand Deposit Accounts, money market and savings accounts. Our transaction accounts include checking and NOW accounts, which provide us with a source of fee income, as well as a low-cost source of funds. Time accounts also provide us with a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. Certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 are held primarily by clients in our Target Market . Deposit rates are reviewed regularly by senior management as we continuously seek to price our deposit products and services competitively to promote core deposit growth. Our management believes that the rates that we offer are competitive with those offered by other institutions in our Target Market. Correspondent Banking We provide correspondent banking services to community banks located in our market. Services we offer include settlement, Fed Funds lines of credit, depository products, wire transfer services, bank holding company loans and loan participations on larger commercial and commercial real estate exposures. Correspondent banking deposits comprised approximately $407.8 million of our total deposits as of December 31, 2020. There were no correspondent banking loans as of December 31, 2020. Deposits from community banks related to correspondent banking comprised 16% of total deposits as of December 31, 2020. Correspondent banking provides a valuable funding source for the bank. In 2013, management identified a void in the Tennessee correspondent banking market due to the instability of larger correspondent banks. Other factors leading to the expansion of correspondent banking included a need to diversify our funding base, the desire by many community banks to do business with a Tennessee-based correspondent bank, the ability to recruit well-known and respected talent for business development and risk management, and the ability to license a low cost proprietary settlement platform. Mortgage Banking Mortgage banking generated $1.0 billion in mortgage loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Mortgage loans are typically sold in the secondary market and are underwritten by the bank. Mortgage banking has provided the bank a source of noninterest income and referrals for other banking services including home equity lines of credit and deposit products. Other Services Given client demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour telephone and online banking, direct deposit, mobile banking, safe deposit boxes, remote deposit and cash management services for individuals and small and medium sized business. We also participate in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers are able to use throughout Tennessee and other regions. In many cases, we reimburse our customer for any ATM fees that may be charged to the customer. Competition The financial services industry is highly competitive in our Target Market. In particular, the Target Market consisted of 65 financial institutions with over $92 billion in deposits as of June 30, 2020. We held the number 10 deposit market share position at June 30, 2020 with 2.3% of the deposit market share. We compete for loans, deposits, and financial services in our Target Market. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area, Internet-based banks, out-of-market banks, and bank holding companies that advertise in or otherwise serve our market area, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. We believe that our experienced leadership, efficient and scalable operating model, personalized service and emphasis on attracting core deposits from our other product offerings enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which we operate. 4 Information and Technology We continually adapt to the changing technological needs and wants of our clients by investing in our electronic banking platform. We use a combination of online and mobile banking channels to attract and retain clients and expand the convenience of banking with us. In most cases, our clients can initiate banking transactions from the convenience of their personal computer or smart phone, reducing the number of in-branch visits necessary to conduct routine banking transactions. The remote transactions available to our clients include remote image deposit, bill payment, external and internal transfers, ACH origination and wire transfer. We believe that our investments in technology and innovation are consistent with our clients’ needs and will support future migration of our clients’ transactions to these and other developing electronic banking channels. Further, we closely monitor information security for trends and new threats, including cybersecurity risks, and invest significant resources to continuously improve the security and privacy of our systems and data. For more information, please see “– Supervision and Regulation - Cybersecurity and Privacy”. Employees As of December 31, 2020, we had 380 total employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance and that of our subsidiaries may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the TDFI, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitizations and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results and those of our bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of insured banks, their holding companies and affiliates that are intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and enter into acquisitions with other companies, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective primary federal regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and our bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. 5 Bank Holding Company Regulation Since we own all of the capital stock of our bank, we are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Acquisition of Banks The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before: • acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will, directly or indirectly, own or control 5% or more of the bank’s voting shares; • acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or • merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of the above transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources includes a focus on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section titled “Item 1. Business—Regulation and Supervision—Capital Adequacy.” The Federal Reserve also considers the effectiveness of the institutions in combating money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering program of the acquiring bank holding company and the anti-money laundering compliance records of a bank to be acquired as part of the transaction. Finally, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration the extent to which the proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Under the BHC Act, if well-capitalized and well-managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. In each case, however, state law may place restrictions on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for at least three years. Change in Bank Control Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute acquisition of “control” of the bank holding company if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the transaction or the bank holding company has registered securities under the Exchange Act. In addition, any person or group of persons acting in concert must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25% (or 5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, the right to control in any manner the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the bank holding company. Permitted Activities Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities: • banking or managing or controlling banks; and • any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 6 Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include: • factoring accounts receivable; • making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities in connection with the foregoing; • leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; • operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; • engaging in trust company functions in a manner authorized by state law; • financial and investment advisory activities; • discount securities brokerage activities; • underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; • providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; • performing selected data processing services and support services; • acting as an agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and • performing selected insurance underwriting activities. The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. Support of Subsidiary Institutions The Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. As a result of a bank holding company’s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank. Repurchase or Redemption of Securities A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions. Bank Regulation and Supervision Our bank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of the operations of our bank. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the safety and soundness of our bank and our bank’s depositors, rather than our shareholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to our bank. 7 Since our bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the state of Tennessee and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI regularly examine our bank’s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Our bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. Our bank is also subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations. Branching Under current Tennessee law, our bank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of, or prior notice to, the TDFI and the Federal Reserve. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, our bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Tennessee. Under federal law, our bank may establish branch offices with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. While prior law imposed various limits on the ability of banks to establish new branches in states other than their home state, the Dodd-Frank Act allows a bank to branch into a new state by setting up a new branch if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. This makes it much simpler for banks to open de novo branches in other states. FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the assessment rate is determined by the risk category assigned to an institution based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations which are designed to measure risk, with riskier institutions paying a higher assessment rate. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC. In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions were required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a federal government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The final FICO assessment collection occurred in March 2019. Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our bank’s record of performance under the CRA is publicly available. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. As of December 31, 2020 the Bank had a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” Interest Rate Limitations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by our bank are subject to applicable state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. 8 Federal Laws Applicable to Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions Our bank’s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including: • the Federal Truth in Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; • the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves; • the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or certain other prohibited factors in all aspects of credit transactions; • the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; • the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by debt collectors; • the Service Members Civil Relief Act, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in military service; • the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, governing the disclosure and safeguarding of sensitive non-public personal information of our clients; • the Right to Financial Privacy Act, imposing a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; • the Electronic Funds Transfer Act governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and clients’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and • the rules and regulations of the CFPB and various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. Capital Adequacy Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, under the adopted regulations, the Basel member central bank and federal bank regulators approved the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord, or Basel III. The U.S. Basel III rule’s minimum capital to risk-weighted assets, or RWA, requirements are as follows: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The rule also changed the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Basel III rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital. Under the U.S. Basel III rule, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016, and the requirements became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization maintaining capital levels in excess of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. A banking organization also would be prohibited from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework requires us to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios of (i) 7% for common equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5% total capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. With the capital conservation buffer fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action, or PCA, well-capitalized thresholds. 9 Generally, banking organizations of our size became subject to the U.S. Basel III rule on January 1, 2015, while the capital conservation buffer and the deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital phase d in over time. Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a banking institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into which all insured depository institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds and other qualitative requirements for each of those categories. For an insured depository institution to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2020, our bank qualified for the “well capitalized” category. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new markets or product offerings, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with Federal Reserve approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. Liquidity Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. This scrutiny has increased during recent years, as the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s negatively affected the liquidity of many financial institutions. Various bank regulatory publications, including Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management) and FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-84-2008 (Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions. Any increased liquidity requirements applied to us or our bank generally would be expected to cause us or our bank to invest assets more conservatively—and therefore at lower yields—than we and our bank otherwise might invest. Such lower-yield investments likely would reduce our revenue stream, and in turn our earnings potential. 10 Payment of Dividends We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, is dividends our bank pays to us as our bank’s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to our bank’s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our shareholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Tennessee corporate law which prevents payment of dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our board of directors must consider our and our bank’s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs. The TDFI also regulates our bank’s dividend payments. Under Tennessee law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend without prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (i) the total of its retained net income for that year, plus (ii) its retained net income for the preceding two years. Our bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Our bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of the bank’s transactions with its affiliates. Subject to various exceptions, the total amount of the bank’s transactions with affiliates is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, transactions with affiliates also must meet specified collateral requirements and safety and soundness requirements. Our bank must also comply with provisions prohibiting the acquisition of low-quality assets from an affiliate. Our bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in transactions with affiliates, as well as other types of transactions set forth in Section 23B, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Our bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions between the bank and third parties, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There are also individual and aggregate limitations on loans to insiders and their related interests. The aggregate amount of insider loans generally cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus. Insiders and banks are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly entering into insider loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Single Borrower Credit Limits Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. 11 Commercial Real Estate Concentration In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.” Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2020, our bank’s total CRE loans represented 242% of total capital. Privacy Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting non-public personal information of their clients. Clients generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing non-public personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. Consumer Credit Reporting The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) imposes, among other things: • requirements for financial institutions to develop policies and procedures to identify potential identity theft and, upon the request of a consumer, to place a fraud alert in the consumer’s credit file stating that the consumer may be the victim of identity theft or other fraud; • requirements for entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies to implement procedures and policies regarding the accuracy and integrity of the furnished information and regarding the correction of previously furnished information that is later determined to be inaccurate; • requirements for mortgage lenders to disclose credit scores to consumers in certain circumstances; and • limitations on the ability of a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate to use that information for marketing purposes. Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation Our bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank has established an anti-money laundering program pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act and customer identification program pursuant to the USA Patriot Act. The bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. Our bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements. Overdraft Fees Federal Reserve Regulation E restricts banks’ abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. 12 The Dodd-Frank Act As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this new law has significantly changed and is significantly changing the bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on the rules and regulations that implement it. A number of the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this “Supervision and Regulation” section. The following items provide a brief description of certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and our bank. • The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to enumerated consumer financial protection laws over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer financial protection laws by their primary federal regulator. • The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. The law created a variety of new consumer protections, including limitations, subject to exceptions, on the manner by which loan originators may be compensated and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower’s “ability to repay” a residential mortgage loan. Final rules implementing these latter statutory requirements became effective in 2014. • The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. • The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (i) requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments; (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (iii) requires national securities exchanges to require listed companies to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers; (iv) authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials; and (v) directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, we expect compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Volcker Rule On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted a final rule implementing the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits any “banking entity” from engaging in proprietary trading or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with covered funds (i.e., hedge funds or private equity funds). In addition, the Volcker Rule requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule. 13 On October 8, 2019, the agencies finalized revisions to the Volcker Rule that, among other things, simplified and streamlined compliance requirements for banking entities that do not have significant trading activities, while banking entities with significant trading activity would become subject to more stringent compliance requirements. Further, the revisions to the Volcker Rule implemented Section 203 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which amended the definition of “banking entity” to exclude certain community banks from the definition of insured depository institution, the general result of which was to exclude such banks and their affiliates and subsidiaries from the scope of the Volcker Rule. Under EGRRCPA, a community bank and its affiliates are generally excluded from the definition of “banking entity” if the bank and all companies that control the bank have total consolidated assets equal to $10 billion or less and trading assets and liabilities equal to five percent or less of total consolidated assets. These revisions became effective on January 1, 2020, with a required compliance date of January 1, 2021. Limitations on Incentive Compensation In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and our bank, the proposal imposes principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions are prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal also imposes certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. The Federal Reserve reserves the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. We do not expect this proposal to significantly impact our business. Cybersecurity and Privacy Cybersecurity is a high-priority item for legislators and regulators at the federal and state levels, as well as internationally. State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements and, in some cases, regulations, emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision. Such policy statements and regulations indicate that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. These requirements, including state regulatory rules such as the detailed and extensive cybersecurity rules issued in 2016 by the New York State Department of Financial Services, may cause us to incur significant additional compliance costs and in some cases may impact our growth prospects. Additionally, if we fail to observe federal or state regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We also employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, as attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume and complexity, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Financial expenditures may also be required to meet regulatory changes in the information security and cybersecurity domains. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See “Item 1A. – Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity. 14 Federal statutes and regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, limit our ability to disclose non-public information about consumers, customers and employees to nonaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the GLBA requires us to disclose our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing non-public information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. The GLBA also requires us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and, if applicable state law is more protective of customer privacy than the GLBA, financial institutions, including our bank, will be required to comply with such state law. Other laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. Proposed or new legislation and regulations may also significantly increase our compliance cost and impede our ability to grow into specific markets. There are a number of proposals that have either recently been adopted or are currently pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. In addition, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) on June 28, 2018. Both the GDPR and the CCPA impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. In the event of a data breach, there are mandatory reporting requirements that may hamper the ability to fully assess an incident prior to external reporting. We must maintain awareness of additional legal and regulatory requirements that apply to existing and future subsets of the customer base for protection against legal, reputational, and financial risk due to compliance failures.

RISK FACTORS We are subject to numerous risks, and the material risks that management believe affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations are described below. Many of these risks are beyond our control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing financial and operational results. You should carefully read and consider the following risks factors. The occurrence of any of the following risks, as well as risks of which we are currently unaware or currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. As a result, the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the following risks and other information in this Report or incorporated into this Report by reference, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” should be carefully considered before investing in shares of our common stock. Some statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Report. Risks Related To Our Business Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by global pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been and may be adversely affected if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to interfere with the ability of our employees, vendors, customers, financing sources, or others to conduct business or continues to negatively affect consumer confidence or the economy. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. The United States declared a national emergency concerning the pandemic, and multiple states and municipalities have declared public health emergencies. Along with these declarations, there have been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions across the United States and the world, including quarantines and “stay-at-home” orders and similar mandates for many individuals to restrict daily activities substantially and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. Although some restrictions have eased in some jurisdictions, there have been increasing rates of COVID-19 infection in regions across the United States and the world in recent months, which have yet to show substantial signs of decline, and some areas are re-imposing closures and other restrictions due to such increasing rates of COVID-19 cases. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting, and is likely to continue to affect, overall economic conditions in the United States. The pandemic is a widespread health crisis that has affected large segments of the global economy, resulting in a rapidly changing market and economic activities. The pandemic and any preventative or protective actions that governments, our customers or suppliers or we may take, in addition to those already in place, with respect to COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on our business, including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, or reduced consumer demand. Any additional financial impact cannot be estimated reasonably at this time but may materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to affect our results will depend on future developments, including whether there are additional outbreaks, mutations or related strains of the virus in locations where we operate, and the availability of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We are uncertain of the potential long-term impacts of the pandemic on our business, and the severity, duration, and timing of the business and economic impacts from the continuing, unprecedented public health effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, which has previously included, and may in the future include, among other things, significant volatility in financial markets and a sharp decrease in the value of equity securities, including our common stock. 16 As a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions. Our business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic and other conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder United States economic growth. As an example, the continued fallout of the global pandemic has resulted in wide reaching shutdown of certain businesses regions in which we operate. Depending on future developments (including the extent of the virus’s spread and the measures, such as quarantines and travel restrictions, taken to contain such spread), the outbreak may adversely affect economic conditions in the United States generally and our markets in particular. Weak economic conditions are characterized by numerous factors; such as deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. The current economic environment is also characterized by interest rates at near historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our loan and investment portfolios. All of these factors can individually or in the aggregate be detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our business and operations are concentrated in our Target Market, and we are more sensitive than our more geographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy. Unlike with many of our larger competitors that maintain significant operations located outside our market area, substantially all of our clients are individuals and businesses located and doing business in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 95% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market. Therefore, our success will depend upon the general economic conditions in this area, which we cannot predict with certainty. As a result, our operations and profitability may be more adversely affected by a local economic downturn in our Target Market than those of larger, more geographically diverse competitors. For example, the Nashville, Tennessee economy is particularly sensitive to changes in the healthcare service, music and entertainment and hospitality and tourism industries, among others. A downturn in these industries or in the local economy generally could make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay their loans and may lead to loan losses that are not offset by operations in other markets; it may also reduce the ability of depositors to make or maintain deposits with us. For these reasons, any regional or local economic downturn that affects our Target market, or existing or prospective borrowers or depositors in our Target Market could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. From time to time, our bank may provide financing to clients who own or have companies or properties located outside our Target Market. In such cases, we would face similar local market risk in those communities for these clients. Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability. The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, internet banks, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our service area. These competitors often have far greater resources than we do and are able to conduct more intensive and broader-based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and individual clients. Our competitors may be able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we choose or have the capability to offer. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. We compete with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we must attract our client base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of 17 consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with an array of financial institutions in our service area. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things: • our ability to recruit and retain experienced and talented bankers at competitive compensation levels; • our ability to build and maintain long-term client relationships while ensuring high ethical standards and safe and sound banking practices; • the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services that we offer; • client satisfaction with our products and services; • industry and general economic trends; and • our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates that we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. We derive a substantial majority of our business from our Target Market, which is a highly competitive banking market. Our failure to compete effectively in our market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. As a bank that focuses on building comprehensive banking relationships with clients, our reputation is critical to our business, and damage to it could have a material adverse effect on us. A key differentiating factor for our business is the strong brand we are building in our Target Market. Through our branding, we communicate to the market about our company and the products and services we offer. Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining clients and employees. Adverse perceptions of us could make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including actual or perceived employee misconduct, misconduct by our outsourced service providers or other counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, our failure to meet our standards of service and quality and compliance failures. Negative publicity regarding us or our bank, whether or not accurate, may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Credit and Interest Rate Risks We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients, who may have greater credit risk than larger borrowers. We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive, economic or financial pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. Our concentration of large loans to a limited number of borrowers may increase our credit risk. Our growth over the last several years has been partially attributable to our ability to originate and retain large loans. In addition to regulatory limits to which our bank is subject, we have established an internal policy limiting loans to one borrower, principal or guarantor based on “total exposure” which represents the aggregate exposure of economically related borrowers for approval purposes; loans in excess of our internal limit require acknowledgment by our bank’s full board of directors. Many of these loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2020, our 25 largest borrowing relationships accounted for approximately 13% of our total loan portfolio. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, this high concentration of borrowers presents a risk to our lending operations. If any one of these borrowers becomes unable to repay its loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce or death, our non-accrual loans and our allowance for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. To mitigate this risk, we establish internal lending limits tied to the borrower’s risk profile, seek collateral, and involve increasing levels of senior management and board involvement in the approval of large loan relationships. 18 Lack of seasoning of our loan portfolio could increase risk of credit defaults in the future. As a result of our growth over the past several years, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 69% of our loan portfolio had been originated since December 31, 2017, including new originations and renewals. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as “seasoning.” As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Because a large portion of our portfolio is relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level of delinquencies and defaults that could occur as the portfolio becomes more seasoned and may not serve as a reliable basis for predicting the health and nature of our loan portfolio. Our limited experience with these loans does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of our loan portfolio. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We may not be able to adequately assess and limit our credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability. A primary component of our business involves making loans to clients. The business of lending is inherently risky because the principal of or interest on the loan may not be repaid timely or at all or the value of any collateral supporting the loan may be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower’s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring our loan applicants and the concentration of our loans and our credit approval practices, may not adequately assess credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively assess and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Repayment of our leveraged loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our leveraged loans are primarily commercial in nature. Frequently, these loans have a secondary source of repayment that is directly correlated with the primary source of repayment. Leveraged borrowers may have a diminished ability to adjust to unexpected events and changes in business conditions because of a higher ratio of liabilities to capital, and in some cases, reliance is placed on enterprise value as a secondary source of repayment. The repayment of leveraged loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and on enterprise value as a secondary source of repayment. To mitigate this risk, we give enhanced scrutiny to leveraged loan transactions, assess risk probabilities using benchmarks obtained from external rating agencies, and engage higher levels of senior management and board involvement in the approval and ongoing review of leveraged loan relationships. Highly Levered Transaction (“HLT”) loan balances to customers amounted to $70.1 million, or 3.7% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management’s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes in a relatively short time period. Inaccurate management assumptions, continuing deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan portfolio and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and may require adjustments based upon judgments that are different than those of management. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, we may need to increase our provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for such losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 19 The healthcare service industry is an integral component of the local economy, and adverse trends in the healthcare service industry could have a material adverse effect on us. The healthcare service industry is an integral segment of the local economy in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 8% of our loan portfolio was composed of loans to borrowers in the healthcare service industry. Adverse trends in the healthcare service industry may have a negative impact on a significant portion of the Company’s borrowers and clients. The healthcare service industry may be affected by the following: • trends in the method of delivery of healthcare services; • competition among healthcare providers; • consolidation of large health insurers; • lower reimbursement rates from government and commercial payors, high uncompensated care expense, investment losses and limited admissions growth pressuring operating profit margins for healthcare providers; • availability of capital; • credit downgrades; • liability insurance expense; • regulatory and government reimbursement uncertainty resulting from changes to laws governing the delivery of healthcare services and reimbursement of providers of healthcare services; • congressional efforts to repeal and federal court cases challenging the legality of certain aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; • health reform initiatives to address healthcare costs through expanded value-based purchasing programs, bundled provider payments, health insurance exchanges, increased patient cost-sharing, geographic payment variations, comparative effectiveness research, lower payments for hospital readmissions, and shared risk-and-reward payment models such as accountable care organizations; • federal and state government plans to reduce budget deficits and address debt ceiling limits by lowering healthcare provider Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, while requiring increased patient access to care; • equalizing Medicare payment rates across different facility-type settings; • heightened health information technology security standards and the meaningful use of electronic health records by healthcare providers; • Pandemics which could result in the extended shutdown or restriction of certain healthcare related businesses and services; and • potential tax law changes affecting healthcare providers. These changes, among others, could adversely affect the economic performance of some or all of our borrowers and clients in the healthcare services industry and, in turn, have a materially negative impact on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans. Our loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, or CRE loans, to individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as construction and land development loans. CRE loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Weak economic conditions or other market factors can result in increased vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial property. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate under adverse conditions. Additionally, non-owner-occupied CRE loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner-occupied CRE loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We mitigate these risks both in our selection criteria for borrowers and project sponsors and in our general practice of requiring cash equity contributions substantially in excess of Supervisory Loan to Value limits as set forth in Appendix A of Part 365 – Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies. 20 A prolonged downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and adversely affect our profitability. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 25% of our loan portfolio was composed of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 9% of owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 18% consumer real estate loans, and 9% construction and land development loans. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A decline in real estate values could further impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amounts we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. If we are required to re-value the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Regulatory requirements affecting our loans secured by commercial real estate could limit our ability to leverage our capital and adversely affect our growth and profitability. The federal banking agencies have indicated their view that banks with high concentrations of loans secured by commercial real estate are subject to increased risk and should implement robust risk management policies and maintain higher capital than regulatory minimums to maintain an appropriate cushion against loss that is commensurate with the perceived risk. Guidance from the Federal banking agencies identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk as those that have (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land loans representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital if the outstanding balance of the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on commercial real estate, a change in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us or a decline in our regulatory capital could limit our ability to leverage our capital as a result of these policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral and own the underlying real estate, subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property. Since we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: • general or local economic conditions; • environmental cleanup liability; • neighborhood assessments; • interest rates; • real estate tax rates; • operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; • supply of and demand for rental units or properties; • ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; • zoning laws; • governmental and regulatory rules; • fiscal policies; and • natural disasters. 21 Our inability to manage the amount of costs or size of the risks associated with the ownership of real estate, or write-downs in the value of other real estate owned, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position that could materially adversely affect our performance. Risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position could materially adversely affect our performance. Home equity products, particularly those where we are in a second lien position, and particularly those in certain geographic areas, may carry a higher risk of non-collection than other loans. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. Of our $ 146 million home equity portfolio at December 31, 2020, approximately $ 138.2 million were home equity lines of credit and $ 7.8 million were closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $ 86.1 million of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position. We have several large depositor relationships, the loss of which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources. As of December 31, 2020, our ten largest non-brokered depositors accounted for approximately 14% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. We may also be forced, as a result of any withdrawal of deposits, to rely more heavily on other, potentially more expensive and less stable funding sources. Consequently, the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Correspondent banking introduces unique risks, which could affect our liquidity. Although correspondent banking provides diversification of our funding base, it introduces a unique set of risks. Increases in the federal funds rate could create liquidity issues within the bank as it competes with the interest on reserves rate paid by the Federal Reserve Bank. Additionally, strong industry-wide loan demand could also create liquidity issues as excess balances held at CapStar Bank by our correspondent banks would presumably be redeployed by those banks into new loans. Further, capital inadequacy or asset quality issues at other institutions could result in increased risk to us due to the potential for large deposit withdrawals. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and our funding sources may be insufficient to fund our future growth. Liquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. An inability to raise funds, at competitive rates or at all, through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. In particular, approximately 82% of our bank’s deposits as of December 31, 2020 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice, while by comparison, 63% of the assets of our bank were loans at December 31, 2020, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. For example, we rely on deposits, federal funds purchased and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (“FHLB”) to fund our operations. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions were to change. In such 22 a circumstance, we may seek additional borrowings to achieve our long-term business objectives; however, they may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, whole loan sale agreements may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach representations or warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including government-sponsored entities, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet deposit withdrawals and other client needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our asset growth, new business transactions, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our profits. Our profits, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our interest rate sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2020, meaning that our net interest income would increase from rising interest rates and decline in response due to falling interest rates. However, many assumptions are used to model the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income. Due to the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions, our models may not be an accurate indicator of how our interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Changes in monetary policy and government responses to adverse economic conditions such as inflation and deflation may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve, could lead to inflation, deflation, or other economic phenomena that could adversely affect our financial performance. The primary impact of inflation on our operations most likely will be reflected in increased operating costs. Conversely, deflation generally will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality. Strategic Risks Our business strategy includes the continuation of our growth plans, and we could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We intend to continue pursuing our growth strategy for our business through organic growth of our loan and deposit portfolio as well as through strategic acquisitions. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties that can be encountered by financial service companies in rapid growth stages, which include the risks associated with the following: • maintaining loan quality; • maintaining adequate management personnel and information systems to oversee such growth; 23 • maintaining adequate control and compliance functions; • obtaining regulatory approvals with respect to acquisitions; • entry into new markets, industries, and product areas; and • the costs associated with identifying and pursuing strategic transactions; and • securing capital and liquidity needed to support anticipated growth. We may not be able to expand our presence in our existing market or new markets. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas, the availability of capital to fund growth opportunities and our ability to manage our growth. Failure to manage our growth effectively could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our bank’s size presents multiple challenges that may restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy, such as our regulatory and internal lending limits and our ability to effectively leverage our infrastructure to implement our business strategy. We are limited in the amount our bank can loan in the aggregate to a single borrower or related borrowers by the amount of the bank’s capital. CapStar Bank is a Tennessee-chartered bank and therefore is subject to the legal lending limits of the state of Tennessee and federal law. Tennessee and federal legal lending limits are safety and soundness measures intended to prevent one person or a relatively small and economically related group of persons from borrowing an unduly large amount of a bank’s funds. They are also intended to safeguard a bank’s depositors by diversifying the risk of loan losses among a relatively large number of credit-worthy borrowers engaged in various types of businesses. Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower generally may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. We have also established an internal limit on loans to one borrower to be between $8 million and $15 million, depending upon the underlying risk rating of the borrower. Loans in excess of our internal limit are noted as a policy exception and require acknowledgment by our bank’s full board of directors. Based upon our bank’s current capital levels, the amount it may lend is significantly less than that of many of our larger competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of the bank’s lending limit from doing business with us. Our bank accommodates larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available. If we are unable to compete effectively for loans from our target clients, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our growth strategy involves strategic acquisitions, and we may not be able to overcome risks associated with such transactions. We plan to continue to explore opportunities to acquire other financial institutions and businesses in or around our existing Target Market or in comparable markets or that would provide scale, low cost of funds, non-interest income or products that are additive to our existing products and services. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the following: • the need to raise new capital; • the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our management’s attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business; • the lack of history among our management team in working together on acquisitions and related integration activities; • the time, expense, difficulty, and uncertainty of integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses; • an inability to realize expected synergies or returns on investment; 24 • failure to discover the existence of liabilities during the due diligence process; • exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may not be indemnified; • potential disruption of our ongoing banking business; and • a loss of key employees or key clients following an acquisition. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying prospective transactions, making it difficult to implement our growth strategy. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future to fund such growth, and the unavailability of additional capital on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect us or our growth. We believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our capital needs for our immediate growth plans. However, we will continue to need capital to support our longer-term growth plans. If capital is not available on favorable terms when we need it, we may have to either issue common stock or other securities on less than desirable terms or reduce our rate of growth until market conditions become more favorable. Either of such events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Operational Risks The fair value of our investment securities could fluctuate because of factors outside of our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Factors beyond our control could significantly affect the fair value of our investment securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments, or OTTI, and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in earnings and/or other comprehensive income (loss), which could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is OTTI usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer, any collateral underlying the security as well as the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Our failure to assess any impairments or losses with respect to our securities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Deterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and federal agency securities could adversely affect us and our banking operations. The long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government is uncertain, as illustrated by the 2011 downgrade by certain rating agencies of the credit rating of the U.S. government and federal agencies. However, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any future downgrade, failure to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the U.S. federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. In particular, such events could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect our profitability. Also, the adverse consequences of any downgrade could extend to those to whom we extend credit and could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 25 We are subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, other third parties, and our employees. When we originate loans, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal, title information and employment and income documentation. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the fair value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, the borrower, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. The persons and entities involved in such a misrepresentation are often difficult to locate, and we are often unable to collect any monetary losses that we have suffered from them. We may bear costs associated with the proliferation of computer theft and cyber-crime. We necessarily collect, use and hold sensitive data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with client expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. Although we actively invest in the security of our technological infrastructure, it is not feasible to defend against every risk posed by rapid technological development and the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our information technology department and third-party vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our employees or other internal sources, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our client accounts may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from network failures, viruses and malware, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters and catastrophic events. A breach of our security or the security of our third-party vendors that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, client notification requirements, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage, any of which could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us. Our risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, liquidity, capital, financial performance, asset/liability, operational, compliance and regulatory, Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, strategic and reputational, information technology and legal. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances, including if our management fails to follow our credit policies and procedures, and thus, it may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. We depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption in the operation of these systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of clients, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 26 We are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data. We rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio accounting. For example, one vendor provides our core banking system through a service bureau arrangement. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of client data. We may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. We may need to switch third-party service providers from time-to-time, which could result in disruption to our business processes, damage to our reputation and a breach of our data security measures. Such a disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. We encounter technological change continually and have fewer resources than certain of our competitors to invest in technological improvements. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to serving clients better, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our success will depend in part on our ability to address our clients’ needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than us, and in the future, we may not be able to implement new technology-driven products and services timely, effectively or at all or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may, in order to remain competitive, be required to make significant capital expenditures, which may increase our overall expenses and have a material adverse effect on our net income. There is also no guarantee that any such investment in these products and services will create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems in the past and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities. In the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk. We use interest rate swaps to help manage our interest rate risk from recorded financial assets and liabilities when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and the asset or liability exposes us to interest rate risk. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and routine monitoring, and is 27 not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. We also have derivatives that result from a service we provide to certain qualifying clients approved through our credit process, and therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the uncollateralized fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rate change s cause the value of our derivatives to decline – though to the extent the derivatives are effective hedges, changes in the value of derivative derivatives could be largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged item. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of lawsuits and related legal proceedings, governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm. Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we may not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings or government or other inquiries. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly materially so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Target Market is susceptible to floods, tornados and other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God, which may adversely affect our business and operations. Substantially all of our business and operations are located in our Target Market, which is an area that has recently been damaged by floods and tornadoes and that is susceptible to other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God. Natural disasters, adverse weather events and acts of God can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. Any economic decline as a result of natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God can reduce the demand for loans and our other client solutions as well as client ability to repay such loans. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on loan portfolios may increase substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God. Therefore, natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God could result in decreased revenue and loan losses that have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation. We are not currently required to comply with SEC rules that implement Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are, therefore, not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose. We will be required to comply with these rules upon ceasing to be an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. We will cease to be an emerging growth company on December 31, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering. 28 When evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Further, the cost of any such compliance with Section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be substantial and have a material effect on our cash flows and earnings. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing, and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and hiring additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the Tax Reform Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The Tax Reform Act significantly changes how corporations in the United States are taxed. The Tax Reform Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As a result, we have recorded a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Reform Act on our deferred tax assets in our financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the Tax Reform Act, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The impact of the Tax Reform Act on our shareholders is uncertain and could be adverse. This Report does not discuss the manner in which the Tax Reform Act might affect our shareholders. Accordingly, we encourage our shareholders to consult with their own legal and tax advisors with respect to the Tax Reform Act and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock. We may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate. In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). This announcement indicated that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. In November 2020, the benchmark administrator for LIBOR announced a consultation regarding its intention to cease the publication of 1 week and 2 month LIBOR as of December 31, 2021 and to cease publication of other LIBOR tenors as of June 30, 2023. Regulators in the United States and United Kingdom were supportive of this consultation and together with the benchmark administrator for LIBOR lay out a path forward in which banks should stop writing new USD LIBOR contracts by the end of 2021, while most legacy contracts will be able to mature before publication of LIBOR ceases. Following the consultation’s comment period, LIBOR’s administrator will share results of the consultation with the FCA and will publish a summary of consultation responses shortly thereafter. While November’s announcements provide important clarity in terms of plans, LIBOR’s administrator noted that the consultation is not an announcement that it will cease the provision of any LIBOR settings after December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict with certainty whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. 29 In particular, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. We have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR, though the majority are scheduled to mature prior to the June 30, 2023 expected date for cessation of most LIBOR tenors. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our Company’s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations . There have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export, including among others, agricultural products, could cause the prices of our customers’ products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt; which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our customers' costs, demand for our customers' products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory and Compliance Risks We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our business activities and impose financial requirements, such as minimum capital requirements, and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies including the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. Regulatory compliance is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, transactions with affiliates, treatment of our clients, and interest rates paid on deposits. We are also subject to financial requirements prescribed by our regulators such as minimum capitalization guidelines, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. Violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank acquisitions and other activities. Recently, banks generally have faced increased regulatory sanctions and scrutiny particularly with respect to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, or USA Patriot Act, and other statutes relating to anti-money laundering compliance and client privacy. Recent legislation has substantially changed, and increased, federal regulation of financial institutions, and there may be significant future legislation (and regulations under existing legislation) that could have a further material effect on bank holding companies like us and banks like CapStar Bank. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. 30 Federal and state regulators periodically examine our business and may require us to remediate adverse examination findings or may take enforcement action against us. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, the Federal Reserve or the TDFI were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to require us to remediate any such adverse examination findings. In addition, these agencies have the power to take enforcement action against us to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation of law or regulation or unsafe or unsound practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, to limit dividends and distributions, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory enforcement action against us could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to numerous fair lending laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. The CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking agencies, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on product offerings. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial service providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service, or IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the requirement to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Financial reform legislation has, among other things, tightened capital standards, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and resulted in new regulations that are likely to increase our costs of operations. As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act depends on the rules and regulations that implement it. 31 Among many other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress. Under federal law and long-standing Federal Reserve policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our bank, and to commit resources to support our bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our shareholders’ or creditors,’ best interests to do so. A requirement to provide such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of repayment to deposit liabilities of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment over general unsecured creditor claims. Our FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase. The deposits of our bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments as determined according to the calculation described in “Supervision and Regulation—Bank Regulation and Supervision—FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments.” High levels of bank failures since the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund following the financial crisis, the FDIC increased deposit insurance assessment rates and charged special assessments to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Even though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange. The trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. Because of this, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock. 32 The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. A future issuance or future issuances of stock could dilute the value of our common stock. Our charter permits us to issue up to an aggregate of 25 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, 21,988,803 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, including 148,414 shares of restricted common stock that have yet to vest. Those shares outstanding do not include the potential issuance, as of December 31, 2020, of 193,255 shares of our common stock subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options under the Stock Incentive Plan, and 242,325 additional shares of our common stock that were reserved for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan. A future issuance of any new shares of our common stock would, and equity-related securities could, cause further dilution in the value of our outstanding shares of common stock. Significant sales of our common stock by certain shareholders could affect the market value of our common stock. On December 21, 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf Registrations Statement”) with the SEC on Form S-3 registering 3,652,094 shares of our common stock held by certain of our long-time shareholders, representing about 20.7% of our total issued and outstanding common stock. The Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 28, 2019. Accordingly, these shares represent a significant number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and, if sold in the market all at once or at about the same time, could depress the market price of our common stock and could further affect our ability to raise equity capital. Further, we cannot predict the size or the effect, if any, that sales of these shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may have on the market price of our shares of common stock or our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Any significant sales of these shares could have a materially adverse impact on our affairs, assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, short- and long-term performance goals, prospects and results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in our bank, to secure that debt. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, interest must be paid to a lender before dividends can be paid to our shareholders, and, in the case of liquidation, our borrowings must be repaid before we can distribute any assets to our shareholders. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if our bank were profitable. The rights of our common shareholders would likely be subordinate to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue an aggregate of up to five million shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. Accordingly, you should assume that any shares of preferred stock that we may issue in the future will also be senior to our common stock. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. We and our bank are subject to capital and other legal and regulatory requirements which restrict our ability to pay dividends. We are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. In addition, because our bank is our only material asset, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on our receipt of dividends from the bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. 33 We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an “emerging growth company,” as described in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These include, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial reporting requirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, a potential exemption from new auditing standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. We will cease to be an “emerging growth company” on December 31, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these reduced regulatory and reporting requirements, which may result in a less active trading market and increased volatility in our stock price. General Risks We are dependent on the services of our management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key personnel or directors may adversely affect our business and operations. We are led by an experienced core management team with substantial experience in the markets that we serve, and our operating strategy focuses on providing products and services through long-term relationship managers and ensuring that our largest clients have relationships with our senior management team. Accordingly, our success depends in large part on the performance of these key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. If any of our executive officers, other key personnel, or directors leaves us or our bank, our operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, our directors’ community involvement and diverse and extensive local business relationships are important to our success. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our headquarters and main branch office are located at 1201 Demonbreun Street, Suites 700 and 103, respectively, Nashville, Tennessee 37203. The Company owns and leases retail bank branches located throughout Tennessee. The Company leases certain premises and equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates, through 2032, and in most instances include options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS General From time to time, the Company is party to legal actions that are routine and incidental to its business. Given the nature, scope and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to the Company’s business, including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, the Company, like all banking organizations, is subject to heightened legal and regulatory compliance and litigation risk. However, based upon available information and in consultation with legal counsel, management does not expect the ultimate disposition of any or a combination of these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects, results of operations, or trading price of its common stock. Litigation Against Gaylon M. Lawrence & The Lawrence Group On October 31, 2017, CapStar filed a complaint, captioned CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. v. Gaylon M. Lawrence & The Lawrence Group, Case No. 3:17-cv-01421 (the “Action”), in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, in connection with Mr. Lawrence and The Lawrence Group's acquisition of our common stock. The complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act by filing materially false and misleading 34 Schedules 13D regarding defendants' acquisition of a minority stake (1,156,675 shares) of our common stock. It also alleged that defendants violated the Change in Bank Control Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1817(j) (the ""CBCA""), by attempting to acquire control of CapStar without first receiving approval from the Federal Reserve, and also that defendants violated Tennessee Code Section 45-2-107 by controlling banks without having registered as a bank holding company. By order dated December 18, 2017, the court granted our motion for expedited discovery. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the Action as well as a separate motion to stay. The motion to stay was denied by the court on May 21, 2018. On September 24, 2018, the court denied in part and granted in part defendants' motion to dismiss, permitting our claims that defendants violated Tennessee Code Section 45-2-107 under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act to proceed. Mr. Lawrence also filed an Interagency Notice of Change in Control pursuant to the CBCA with the Federal Reserve on October 30, 2017 ( the “Notice”), seeking permission to acquire up to 15% of the outstanding voting shares of our common stock. At the Federal Reserve's direction, on March 13, 2018, Mr. Lawrence requested that the Federal Reserve suspend processing of this Notice. On November 6, 2018, the Federal Reserve notified us that it has determined not to disapprove the Notice, subject to compliance by Mr. Lawrence and his affiliates with extensive representations and commitments set forth in correspondence between Mr. Lawrence and the Federal Reserve. On November 19, 2019, Mr. Lawrence filed an amended Schedule 13D in which he asserted that the Federal Reserve’s determination not to disapprove his Notice has now expired, and in which Mr. Lawrence further stated that he “does not presently intend to file a new Interagency Notice of Change in Control with the Federal Reserve.” On July 23, 2020, CapStar and Mr. Lawrence entered into a settlement agreement, whereby CapStar agreed to file a joint stipulation, dismissing the Action without prejudice. On July 24, 2020, CapStar filed the stipulation, which the court granted on July 24, 2020. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 35 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES CapStar Financial’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CSTR” and has traded on that market since September 22, 2016. Prior to that time, there was no established public trading market for our stock. As of February 26, 2021, there were approximately 2,903 holders of record of shares of our common stock. The following table shows information related to the repurchase of shares of common stock by the Company during the three months ended December 31, 2020. Total number of shares purchased (1) Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plan (2) Maximum amount that may yet be purchased under the plan October 1 - October 31 2,324 $ 9.81 — $9.00 million November 1 - November 30 — — — $9.00 million December 1 - December 31 203 12.39 — $9.00 million Total 2,527 $ 10.02 — $9.00 million (1) Activity represents shares of common stock withheld to pay purchase price and taxes due upon vesting of restricted shares and exercise of stock options. For information regarding securities authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans, please see “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management And Related Stockholder Matters”. (2) On March 10, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) authorized the Company to repurchase up to $9 million of shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to a written plan that was entered into with Piper Sandler & Co. and that is intended to comply with applicable federal securities laws (the “Plan”). The Plan terminated by its terms on December 31, 2020, with no shares having been repurchased under the Plan. 36 Stock Performance Graph The following stock performance graph compares total shareholders return on our common stock for the period beginning at the close of trading on September 22, 2016 until December 31, 2020, with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Bank Index for the same period. Cumulative total return is computed by dividing the difference between the share price of our common stock at the end and the beginning of the measurement period by the share price of our common stock at the beginning of the measurement period. The performance graph assumes $100 is invested on September 22, 2016 in shares of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Bank Index and that dividends are reinvested into additional shares of common stock at the same frequency with which dividends are paid on such shares during the applicable fiscal year. Historical stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The information in this paragraph and the following stock performance graph shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C, other than as provided in Item 201 of Regulation S-K, or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically request that such information be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporate it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. 37 CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (CSTR) NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC) NASDAQ Bank Index (BKX) 09/22/2016 $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 12/31/2016 138 104 129 12/31/2017 131 134 136 12/31/2018 93 131 113 12/31/2019 107 178 140 12/31/2020 96 259 130 Dividend Policy Holders of shares of our voting and non-voting common and preferred stock are only entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for dividends. As a Tennessee corporation, we are not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. Because we are a bank holding company and do not engage directly in business activities of a material nature, our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock depends, in large part, upon our receipt of dividends from our bank, which is also subject to numerous limitations on the payment of dividends under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. Pursuant to Tennessee law, our bank may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank’s net income for that year plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. For additional information, see “Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Bank Regulation and Supervision—Payment of Dividends.” As of the date of this Report, only shares of our common stock are issued and outstanding. Subject to the regulatory restrictions noted above and satisfactory financial results, the Company currently expects that comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders in the future will depend on regulatory restrictions and our liquidity and capital requirements, as well as our earnings and financial condition, the general economic climate, contractual restrictions, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Use of Proceeds On September 27, 2016, the Company sold 1,688,049 shares of its common stock, including 387,750 shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to the full exercise of their purchase option, in its initial public offering (“IPO”). In addition, certain selling shareholders participated in the IPO and sold an aggregate of 1,284,701 shares of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate offering price for the shares sold by the Company was approximately $25.3 million, and after deducting approximately $1.6 million for the underwriting discount and approximately $2.1 million of offering expenses paid to third parties, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $21.6 million. All of the shares were sold pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-213367), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 21, 2016. The offering did not terminate until all of the shares offered were sold. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our prospectus filed with the SEC on September 23, 2016 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act. Pending application of the IPO proceeds, we have invested the net proceeds in short-term investments. During 2017, the Company provided $10.0 million of the IPO proceeds as a capital contribution to the Bank for working capital purposes. 38 ITEM 6.

On July 1, 2020, we completed our acquisitions of FCB Corporation and the Bank of Waynesboro. For more information, please see “Item 1.—Business—Overview—Acquisitions”. The operations of FCB and BOW are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020. The acquisitions and incorporations of these entities into our financial statements may materially affect the comparability of the selected financial data provided for fiscal year 2020 as compared to previous years. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under the caption “Part II., Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law. The following discussion and analysis pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, the following discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level. All dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when otherwise specifically noted. Unless specifically noted in this Report, all references in this section to the fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 mean our fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Overview We completed 2020 with net income of $24.7 million, or $1.22 diluted net income per share, compared to net income of $22.4 million, or $1.20 diluted net income per share, for 2019. Average loans for 2020 were $1.70 billion, a 16.8% increase over 2019, and average deposits for 2020 were $2.26 billion, a 35.2% increase over 2019. The comparability of our financial condition and performance has been impacted by our acquisitions of FCB and BOW discussed below. We acquired FCB and BOW on July 1, 2020. On the acquisition date, the fair market value of the acquired net assets was $67.3 million, including $294.7 million in loans and $442.7 million in deposits. Net income for 2020 was reduced by $5.4 million of pretax merger related charges related to this acquisition. The FCB and BOW acquisitions further expanded our franchise within the Tennessee market. The outbreak of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has resulted in a global pandemic causing the extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. The recent developments to contain COVID-19 has adversely affected economic conditions in the United States generally and our markets in particular. The Company expects the effects of this health crisis, which include disruptions or restrictions in clients’ supply chains, closures of clients’ facilities or decreases in demand for clients’ products and services, to continue to adversely impact economic conditions. Also related to the health crisis, the U.S. has been operating under a presidential declared emergency since March 13, 2020, with various actions by the U.S. Congress and regulatory agencies. As a result of COVID-19, the Company experienced the decline of asset prices, reduction in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, borrower credit deterioration and market volatility. Although the Company is unable to estimate the extent of the impact, the continuing pandemic and related global economic crisis is likely to adversely impact its future operating results. Management is actively monitoring the situation and taking necessary actions to adjust operations to protect the health and well-being of employees and clients. Despite the uncertainty the Company is well positioned to continue delivering on its strategic initiatives in a responsible manner by prioritizing things such as business continuity, liquidity management and maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company has taken a proactive approach to protecting our team members and their families as a result of COVID-19. The Company was an early adopter of a work from home strategy having previously made significant investments in laptops, virtual private network access, and bandwidth. Through its business continuity procedures, employees tested remote access the first week of March and all non-financial center employees have been working remotely since March 11, 2020. Management has organized a Committee (“Pandemic Committee”) which meets regularly to ensure the health of employees, discuss the state of operations, and ensure we are providing the best possible client service and support during this challenging time. Additionally, non-essential business travel has been suspended and company-wide cleaning efforts have been enhanced. As of March 23, 2020, the Company expanded its social distancing practice by modifying the operations of its financial center network to support the efforts of public health authorities and to help curtail the spread of COVID-19. 40 When appropriate t he Company has temporarily redirect ed clients to its digital channels, drive-thrus, and ATMs which can handle most financial transactions. The pandemic is constantly evolving, and the Company is making every effort to ensure its response is aligned with its priority to protect the health and safety of employees, clients and the communities we serve. The redirect model for the financial center network was phased out after ongoing monitoring of CDC, state, local COVID-19 guidelines and area COVID-19 statistics. The reopening of the financial center network was handled in a controlled reopening model at the recommendation of the Pandemic Committee. The key to this reopening was the implementation of safety protocols in the COVID-19 environment for the bank staff and customers based on geographic area results of the state. Currently, all financial centers are open to the public. On October 1, 2020, support service staff working remotely for the bank began to return to the workplace in limited numbers on a rotation schedule. This return from the remote work environment was by design and a direct result of the number of employees housed in these areas. Best practices around social distancing, mask usage and cleaning of work areas has been incorporated into the daily work practice. Staff rotation of the support services teams will continue as needed to accommodate CDC and local gathering guidelines. The Pandemic Committee continues to meet to review changes in guidelines with staff and customer safety related to COVID-19 at the forefront. The Pandemic Committee reports on developments within the bank footprint and the possible impact on the banks business model. As a result, adjustments to the protocol are made as needed. While the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is largely uncertain, based on an initial assessment of the impact to our loan portfolio we increased our allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses of $7.6 million during the first quarter of 2020, and an additional $1.6 million, $2.1 million, and $0.2 million during the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. In an effort to provide relief to clients most impacted by the pandemic, CapStar Bank proactively offered a 90-day full deferment of all loan payments to CapStar borrowers that were less than 30 days past due. As a result, approximately 700 loans (representing approximately $452 million in outstanding loan balances) were approved for payment deferment during the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining loans still under deferment had been reduced to 13 borrowers (representing approximately $62 million in outstanding loan balances). CapStar Bank was actively involved in assisting clients applying for loans under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). Through this program we have approved approximately 1,334 PPP loans or $185.5 million which were outstanding and recorded in total loans on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As the pandemic continues, we will continue to assess the impact on our market. While it is likely losses will materialize in the future, we continue to proactively work with our clients and evaluate the potential impact of the pandemic on them and us. Furthermore, we currently do not anticipate a significant adverse liquidity impact related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, since the start of the pandemic, deposit inflows have increased sharply, significantly strengthening liquidity. Nonetheless, the Company has a comprehensive contingency funding plan that addresses potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements that may arise from the COVID-19 pandemic. See further discussion regarding the Company’s management of liquidity risk in the subsequent section titled “Liquidity”. Our primary revenue source is net interest income and fees from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to our overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and the rates paid on deposits directly impact our profitability. Business volumes are influenced by competition, new business acquisition efforts and economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence. Net interest income increased $8.6 million, or 12.7%, to $76.3 million for 2020 compared to $67.7 million for 2019. The increase was largely attributable to the FCB and BOW acquisitions, which was partially offset by the adverse impact of lower interest rates in 2020 when compared to 2019. Net interest margin decreased to 3.10% for 2020, compared with 3.64% for 2019. Provision for loan losses was $11.5 million in 2020 compared to $0.8 million in 2019. This increase was primarily the result of credit deterioration associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management’s evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for the estimated probable inherent losses on outstanding loans. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was 1.23% of total loans, compared with 0.89% of total loans at December 31, 2019. 41 Total noninterest income for 20 20 in creased $ 19.0 million, or 78.2 %, to $ 43.2 million compared to $ 24.3 million for 201 9 , and comprised 32.0 % of total revenues. Total noninterest expense for 2020 increased $15.4 million, or 24.8%, to $77.4 million compared to $62.0 million for 2019. Our efficiency ratio for 2020 was 64.7% compared to 67.4% for 2019. Despite the increase in noninterest expense, including acquisition related costs, the improvement in efficiency ratio for 2020 is primarily attributable to operational improvements and synergies achieved through the FCB and BOW acquisitions. The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 19.6% for 2020 from 23.4% for 2019. The lower effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 is mainly the result of net operating loss carryback provisions associated with the CARES Act and the establishment of a Real Estate Investment Trust in 2020. Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a measure of a company's capital which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Our ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets was 10.01% as of December 31, 2020, compared with 11.47% at December 31, 2019. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The following sections provide more details on subjects presented in this overview. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may materially and adversely affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate. Allowance for Loan Losses We record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit-worthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses, particularly the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans and on groups of loans that are not impaired, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is included elsewhere in this Report. 42 Investment Securities Impairment We assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded in earnings. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is “more likely than not” that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period, and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits. Business Combinations Assets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the loans are considered impaired, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted as necessary for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisions that may be required.

The following sections provide a more detailed analysis of significant factors affecting our operating results. Net Interest Income The largest component of our net income is net interest income – the difference between the income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets and interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by total average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our net interest income. The following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Interest-Earning Assets Loans (1) $ 1,695,998 $ 78,180 4.61 % $ 1,451,821 $ 78,557 5.41 % $ 1,134,836 $ 57,962 5.11 % Loans held for sale 169,492 6,092 3.59 % 100,464 4,271 4.25 % 58,250 2,789 4.79 % Securities: Taxable investment securities (2) 250,042 5,455 2.18 % 176,647 5,374 3.04 % 166,287 4,755 2.86 % Investment securities exempt from federal income tax (3) 49,474 1,326 3.39 % 52,392 1,438 3.47 % 47,270 1,201 3.22 % Total securities 299,516 6,781 2.38 % 229,039 6,812 3.14 % 213,557 5,956 2.94 % Cash balances in other banks 307,852 799 0.26 % 87,305 1,881 2.15 % 54,454 1,011 1.85 % Funds sold 18 0 2.77 % 752 26 3.52 % 2,483 63 2.55 % Total interest-earning assets 2,472,876 91,852 3.73 % 1,869,381 91,547 4.92 % 1,463,580 67,781 4.65 % Noninterest-earning assets 149,760 137,947 65,336 Total assets $ 2,622,636 $ 2,007,328 $ 1,528,916 Interest-Bearing Liabilities Interest bearing deposits: Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 744,144 3,868 0.52 % $ 499,468 7,538 1.51 % $ 330,952 4,164 1.26 % Savings and money market deposits 549,533 5,196 0.95 % 494,587 7,266 1.47 % 424,052 5,446 1.28 % Time deposits 407,224 5,317 1.31 % 361,956 7,542 2.08 % 227,760 3,940 1.73 % Total interest-bearing deposits 1,700,901 14,381 0.85 % 1,356,011 22,346 1.65 % 982,764 13,550 1.38 % Borrowings and repurchase agreements 27,809 1,148 4.13 % 48,629 1,453 2.99 % 99,450 2,539 2.55 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,728,710 15,529 0.90 % 1,404,640 23,799 1.69 % 1,082,214 16,089 1.49 % Noninterest-bearing deposits 558,416 315,031 262,280 Total funding sources 2,287,126 1,719,671 1,344,494 Noninterest-bearing liabilities 29,762 23,533 8,736 Shareholders’ equity 305,748 264,124 175,686 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 2,622,636 $ 2,007,328 $ 1,528,916 Net interest spread (4) 2.83 % 3.22 % 3.17 % Net interest income/margin (5) $ 76,323 3.10 % $ 67,748 3.64 % $ 51,692 3.55 % (1) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees, net of deferred loan costs. 44 (2) Taxable investment securities include restricted equity securities. (3) Yields on tax exempt securities are shown on a tax equivalent basis. (4) Net interest spread is the average yield on total interest-earning assets minus the average rate on total interest-bearing liabilities. (5) Net interest margin is net interest income calculated on a tax equivalent basis divided by total average interest-earning assets. The following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates earned or paid on these assets and liabilities. 2020 Compared to 2019 2019 Compared to 2018 Increase (decrease) due to Increase (decrease) due to Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net Interest-Earning Assets Loans $ 13,212 $ (13,589 ) $ (377 ) $ 16,190 $ 4,405 $ 20,595 Loans held for sale 2,935 (1,114 ) 1,821 2,022 (540 ) 1,482 Securities: Taxable investment securities 2,233 (2,151 ) 82 296 323 619 Investment securities exempt from federal income tax (71 ) (40 ) (112 ) 165 72 237 Total securities 2,161 (2,192 ) (30 ) 461 395 856 Cash Balances In Other Banks 4,749 (5,831 ) (1,082 ) 609 261 870 Funds Sold (26 ) — (26 ) (44 ) 7 (37 ) Total interest-earning assets 23,032 (22,726 ) 306 19,238 4,528 23,766 Interest Bearing Liabilities Interest-bearing transaction accounts 3,693 (7,363 ) (3,670 ) 2,120 1,254 3,374 Savings and money market deposits 807 (2,877 ) (2,070 ) 906 914 1,820 Time deposits 943 (3,168 ) (2,225 ) 2,321 1,281 3,602 Borrowings and repurchase agreements (622 ) 317 (305 ) (1,297 ) 211 (1,086 ) Total interest-bearing liabilities 4,821 (13,091 ) (8,270 ) 4,050 3,660 7,710 Net Interest Income $ 18,211 $ (9,636 ) $ 8,575 $ 15,188 $ 868 $ 16,056 2020 compared to 2019 Our net interest income increased $8.6 million, or 12.7%, from 2019 to 2020 due to a 32% increase in average earning assets, which was offset by a 54 basis point or 148.4% decline in the net interest margin average yield rate. Our net interest margin was 3.10% and 3.64% for 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the decline triggered by two factors related to the pandemic – first, the Federal Reserve reducing the Federal Funds target rate by 1.50% in March 2020, one of numerous actions intended to offset the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. economy, and second, the sharp increase in deposits near the start of the pandemic, with deposits increasing $332 million or 19% in the 2nd quarter. Additionally, included in interest expense for savings and money market deposits in 2020 is a loss on previously terminated interest rate swaps of $1.9 million. For 2020 compared to 2019, loan volumes increased 16.8% while loan yields declined from 5.41% to 4.61% due to the impact of lower market interest rates on yields of new loan originations and yields of existing variable rate loans. Average loans for 2020 increased 16.8% compared to 2019 as a result of the FCB and BOW acquisitions, the Company’s active participation in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), additional bankers in the Nashville and Knoxville MSA, and continued focus on attracting new clients. 45 Average security yields decreased from 3. 1 4 % to 2.38% for 2019 and 2020, respectively, primarily due to decreases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio, the impact of lower market interest rates on the yields of securities purchased to replace security maturities and paydowns, and the Company’s purchase of additional conservative lower yield securities to deploy a portion of pandemic-related deposit growth. We funded our growth in loans through an increase in funding sources of 33.0% from 2019 to 2020. The primary driver of our increased funding sources was growth in our deposits of 35.2% from 2019 to 2020, driven by the FCB and BOW acquisitions and the sharp increase in deposits near the start of the pandemic. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased 77.3% from 2019 to 2020. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.90% for 2020 compared to 1.69% for 2019. The majority of this decrease was due to decreases in the Federal Funds rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . 2019 compared to 2018 Our net interest income increased $16.1 million, or 31.1%, from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to increasing loan volumes and interest rates rising at a faster pace than interest bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin was 3.64% and 3.55% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. For 2019 and 2018, average loan yields increased from 5.11% to 5.41% which was primarily driven by increases in short-term interest rate indexes affecting the variable rate portion of our loan portfolio, offset by competitive pricing pressures, as well as realizing a full year of additional interest income related to the acquisition of Athens, including additional interest income as a result of accretable yield. The full year average LIBOR – 1 month interest rate increased from 2.02% in 2018 to 2.23% in 2019. Similarly, the full year average Bank Prime Loan Rate increased from 4.90% in 2018 to 5.28% in 2019. Approximately 55% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 was variable in nature, a significant portion of which is indexed to 1 month LIBOR and the Bank Prime Loan Rate. Average loans for 2019 increased 27.9% compared to 2018 as a result of the Athens acquisition, adding new bankers in the Nashville MSA and continued focus on attracting new clients. Average security yields increased from 2.94% to 3.14% for 2018 and 2019, respectively, primarily due to increases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio. The resulting yield on average interest-earning assets increased 27 basis points for 2019 compared to 2018. We funded our growth in loans through an increase in funding sources of 27.9% from 2018 to 2019. The primary driver of our increased funding sources was growth in our deposits of 34.2% from 2018 to 2019 which was largely driven by the Athens acquisition. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased 20.1% from 2018 to 2019. Provision for Loan losses Our policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.23%, 0.89% and 0.85% at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 2020 compared to 2019 The provision for loan losses amounted to $11.5 million and $0.8 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Provision expense is impacted by macroeconomic factors, the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of net charge-offs. Provision expense increased for 2020 compared to 2019 due to significantly increased qualitative factors in our allowance for loan losses methodology in anticipation of credit deterioration associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although losses have not yet materialized as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our overall reserves are deemed to be adequate in light of the economic uncertainty of the pandemic. Charge-offs for 2020 were $1.2 million compared to $0.8 million for 2019. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 0.89% at December 31, 2019 to 1.23% at December 31, 2020. This increase was largely due to our assessment of risk generally related to macro-economic, geo-political conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact on asset quality. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, 46 are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets, or particular industry or borrower-specific conditions, which may materially and negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses. 2019 compared to 2018 The provision for loan losses amounted to $0.8 million and $2.8 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Provision expense is impacted by the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of net charge-offs. Provision expense decreased for 2019 compared to 2018 due to decreased charge-offs. Charge-offs for 2019 were $0.8 million compared to $5.0 million for 2018. Of the $5.0 million in charge offs during 2018, $4.6 million was attributable to a single borrower. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 0.85% at December 31, 2018 to 0.89% at December 31, 2019. This increase was largely due to our assessment of risk generally related to macro-economic, geo-political conditions and asset quality. In addition, during 2019, we increased the look-back period, from which we calculate peer bank historical loss experience, from 37 to 41 quarters. Our look-back period is utilized to calculate peer historical loss experience, adjusted for current factors, to comprise the general component of the allowance for loan losses. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period is necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. The extension of the historical look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets, or particular industry or borrower-specific conditions, which may materially and negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses. Noninterest Income In addition to net interest income, we generate recurring noninterest income. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We have mortgage banking activities that generate revenue from originating and selling mortgages, the origination and sale of commercial real estate loans, and wealth management fees. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, we own insurance on several key employees and record income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. The following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated. 2020-2019 2019-2018 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2020 2019 (Decrease) 2018 (Decrease) Noninterest income: Treasury management and other deposit service charges $ 3,494 $ 3,135 11.5 % $ 2,150 45.8 % Interchange and debit card transaction fees 3,172 3,251 (2.4 )% 752 332.3 % Mortgage banking income 25,034 9,467 164.4 % 5,653 67.5 % Tri-Net fees 3,693 2,785 32.6 % 1,503 85.3 % Wealth management fees 1,573 1,425 10.4 % 794 79.5 % Net gain (loss) on sale of SBA loans 1,440 803 79.3 % 248 223.8 % Net gain (loss) on sale of securities 125 (99 ) 226.3 % 3 (3400.0 )% Other noninterest income 4,717 3,507 34.5 % 4,356 (19.5 )% Total noninterest income $ 43,248 $ 24,274 78.2 % $ 15,459 57.0 % 47 2 020 compared to 201 9 The increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2020 was driven primarily by the incremental increase in transaction volume related to our acquisition of FCB and BOW, as well as growth in the volume of our commercial and consumer deposit accounts. Mortgage banking income consists of mortgage fee income from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Mortgage banking income increased 164.4% from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to a significantly higher volume of originations from home buyers capitalizing on lower interest rates. Tri-Net fees, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, is derived from the origination and sale of commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. The volume of loan sales has increased through continued growth and development. Other noninterest income primarily consists of loan related fees, bank-owned life insurance and other service-related fees. The increase of $1.2 million from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to organic growth and our acquisition of FCB and BOW. 2019 compared to 2018 The increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2019 was driven primarily by the incremental increase in transaction volume related to our acquisition of Athens, as well as growth in the volume of our commercial and consumer deposit accounts. Mortgage banking income consists of mortgage fee income from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Mortgage banking income increased 67.5% from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to a significantly higher volume of originations. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2019, we implemented a hedging program for residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. In connection with this program, we elected the fair value option for this portfolio. The fair value adjustments for applicable loans held for sale and related derivative instruments at December 31, 2019 resulted in a $1.1 million increase in mortgage banking income for 2019 when compared to 2018. Noninterest Expense Our total noninterest expense increase reflects expenses that we have incurred as we build the foundation to support our recent growth and enable us to execute our growth strategy. The following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated. 2020-2019 2019-2018 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2020 2019 (Decrease) 2018 (Decrease) Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits $ 45,252 $ 35,542 27.3 % $ 28,586 24.3 % Data processing and software 8,865 6,961 27.4 % 3,835 81.5 % Professional fees 2,224 2,102 5.8 % 1,608 30.7 % Occupancy 3,590 3,345 7.3 % 2,336 43.2 % Equipment 3,195 3,723 (14.2 )% 2,471 50.7 % Regulatory fees 1,261 591 113.4 % 1,028 (42.5 )% Acquisition related expenses 5,390 2,654 103.1 % 9,803 (72.9 )% Amortization of intangibles 1,824 1,655 10.2 % 465 255.9 % Other operating 5,760 5,422 6.2 % 3,355 61.6 % Total noninterest expense $ 77,361 $ 61,995 24.8 % $ 53,487 15.9 % 48 20 20 compared to 201 9 The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by the incremental increase in compensation costs related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW, as well as increased compensation associated with strong revenue growth in mortgage banking. At December 31, 2020, our associate base increased to 380 compared to 289 at December 31, 2019. Data processing and software expense increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth, costs associated with running dual systems related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW and insourcing certain IT related functions. The acquisition related systems conversion was successfully completed during the third quarter of 2020. The increase in occupancy expense from 2019 to 2020 was largely attributable to increased depreciation and other facilities related expenses associated with our acquisitions of FCB and BOW as well as the increasing cost of managing our IT network. Amortization of intangibles increased from 2019 to 2020 due to the new core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the FCB and BOW acquisitions. Our efficiency ratio was 64.7% and 67.4% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income and measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio decreased in 2020 due to operational improvements and synergies achieved through the FCB and BOW acquisitions. 2019 compared to 2018 The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by the increase in compensation costs related to our acquisition of Athens and 2019 being the first full year of Athens’ related compensation costs being recognized. At December 31, 2019, our associate base had slightly decreased to 289 compared to 295 at December 31, 2018. Data processing and software expense increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth, costs associated with running dual systems related to our acquisition of Athens and insourcing certain IT related functions. The Athens related systems conversion was successfully completed during the second quarter of 2019. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense from 2018 to 2019 was largely attributable to increased depreciation and other facilities related expenses associated with our acquisition of Athens as well as the increasing cost of managing our IT network. Amortization of intangibles increased from 2018 to 2019 due to the new core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the Athens acquisition. Our efficiency ratio was 67.4% and 79.7% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income and measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. As expected, the efficiency ratio improved in 2019 due to the majority of the non-recurring merger expenses incurred in 2018. Income Taxes 2020 compared to 2019 We recorded income tax expense of $6.0 million and $6.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 19.6% and 23.4%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate by our investments in municipal securities, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. The lower effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 is mainly the result of net operating loss carryback provisions associated with the CARES Act and the establishment of a Real Estate Investment Trust in 2020. 2019 compared to 2018 We recorded income tax expense of $6.8 million and $1.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2019 and 2018 was 23.4% and 10.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate by our investments in municipal securities, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of 49 certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is mainly the result of the nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds received in 2018 as well as a larger amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation in 2018. Financial Condition 2020 compared to 2019 Total assets increased $946.9 million, or 46.5%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Loans grew from $1.420 billion at December 31, 2019 to $1.891 billion at December 31, 2020, a 33.2% increase. Loans held for sale increased $11.4 million, or 6.8%, during 2020 which is primarily related to the timing of selling residential and commercial real estate loans. Available for sale securities increased $278.1 million, or 128%, as the Company deployed excess capital into such investments. Also, included in these changes is growth from our acquisitions of FCB and BOW which included $514.7 million in total assets, primarily made up of $294.7 million in loans and $98.7 million in securities. Total liabilities increased $876.5 million, or 49.7%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Deposits increased from $1.729 billion at December 31, 2019 to $2.568 billion at December 31, 2020, a 48.5% increase. Included in liabilities is the third quarter issuance of $29.4 million in subordinated debt during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, total liabilities and deposits acquired in our FCB and BOW acquisitions were $447.4 million and $442.7 million, respectively. 2019 compared to 2018 Total assets increased $73.3 million, or 3.7%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Loans decreased from $1.430 billion at December 31, 2018 to $1.420 billion at December 31, 2019, a 0.7% decrease. Loans held for sale increased $110.6 million, or 192.0%, during 2019 which is primarily related to transaction volume of selling residential and commercial real estate loans as a result of continued strong growth. Securities decreased $31.1 million, or 12.6%. Total liabilities increased $54.7 million, or 3.2%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Deposits increased from $1.570 billion at December 31, 2018 to $1.729 billion at December 31, 2019, a 10.2% increase. We paid down our Federal Home Loan Bank advances $115.0 million, or 92.0%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 as we were able to rely more on deposit funding. Investment Securities The primary purpose of our investment portfolio is to provide another source of interest income, as well as liquidity management. In managing the composition of the balance sheet, we seek a balance between earnings sources and credit and liquidity considerations. We manage our investment portfolio according to a written investment policy approved by our board of directors. Balances in our investment portfolio are subject to change over time based on our funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of funds, and are maintained at levels we believe are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities, all with varying contractual maturities. However, these maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as some of these securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. The investment portfolio is regularly reviewed by the Asset Liability Management committee, or ALCO, of the bank to ensure an appropriate risk and return profile as well as for adherence to the investment policy. 50 Our investment portfolio totaled $ 488 . 6 million, $ 216.4 million , and $ 247.5 million at December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 , respectively. Excluding investment securities acquired in our acquisition s of FCB and BOW , o ur investment portfolio increased significantly as part of our efforts to improve balance sheet management through investing in high quality securities and deploying excess liquidity resulting from increased deposits . See “Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our investment securities. The following table presents the fair value of our securities as of December 31, 2020 by their stated maturities (this maturity schedule excludes security prepayment and call features), as well as the weighted average yields for each maturity range.

Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. The composition of gross loans and leases at December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate - owner occupied $ 162,603 8.6 % $ 172,456 12.1 % $ 141,864 9.9 % $ 101,132 10.7 % $ 106,735 11.4 % Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied 481,229 25.4 % 387,443 27.3 % 408,582 28.6 % 249,490 26.3 % 195,587 20.9 % Consumer real estate 343,791 18.2 % 256,097 18.0 % 253,562 17.7 % 102,581 10.8 % 97,015 10.4 % Construction and land development 174,859 9.2 % 143,111 10.1 % 174,670 12.2 % 82,586 8.7 % 94,491 10.1 % Commercial and industrial 630,775 33.4 % 394,408 27.8 % 404,600 28.3 % 373,248 39.4 % 379,620 40.6 % Consumer 44,279 2.3 % 28,426 2.0 % 25,615 1.8 % 6,862 0.8 % 5,974 0.6 % Other 53,483 2.8 % 38,161 2.7 % 20,901 1.5 % 31,638 3.3 % 55,829 6.0 % Total gross loans and leases $ 1,891,019 100.0 % $ 1,420,102 100.0 % $ 1,429,794 100.0 % $ 947,537 100.0 % $ 935,251 100.0 % Over the past five years, we have experienced significant growth in our loan portfolio. During 2016 and continuing through 2020, we recognized growth in the commercial real estate loan classifications reflecting the development of the Target Market in which we operate. The acquisitions of FCB and BOW have increased various loan balance classifications and provided further diversity in our loan portfolio through more consumer-oriented loan products. 51 Our primary focus has been on commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending, which constituted 67 % of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 20 20 . Although we expect continued growth wi th respect to our loan portfolio, we do not expect any significant changes over the foreseeable future in the composition of our loan portfolio or in our emphasis on commercial lending. Our loan growth since inception has been reflective of the Target Market in which we serve. The commercial real estate category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans which are similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the affiliated business rather than on the valuation and cash flows of the real estate from unaffiliated tenants . Since 2009, our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios have continued to experience strong growth, primarily due to implementation of our relationship-based banking model and the success of our relationship managers in transitioning commercial banking relationships from other local financial institutions and in competing for new business from attractive small to mid-sized commercial clients. Many of our larger commercial clients have lengthy relationships with members of our senior management team or our relationship managers that date back to their employment by other financial institutions. The repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes for our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. December 31, 2020 Due in 1 year or less Due in 1-5 years Due after 5 years Total Commercial real estate $ 203,809 $ 203,753 $ 236,270 $ 643,832 Consumer real estate 277,021 20,545 46,225 343,791 Construction and land development 67,241 39,189 68,429 174,859 Commercial and industrial 148,103 319,650 163,022 630,775 Consumer 15,223 9,035 20,021 44,279 Other 15,873 15,496 22,114 53,483 Total gross loans $ 727,270 $ 607,668 $ 556,081 $ 1,891,019 Interest rate sensitivity Fixed interest rates 127,762 336,034 228,118 691,914 Floating or adjustable interest rates 599,508 271,634 327,963 1,199,105 Total gross loans $ 727,270 $ 607,668 $ 556,081 $ 1,891,019 The information presented in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio. Asset Quality One of our key objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality in our loan portfolio. We utilize disciplined and thorough underwriting processes that collaboratively engage our seasoned and experienced business bankers, credit underwriters and portfolio managers in the analysis of each loan request. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ scaled review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. In addition, we have adopted underwriting guidelines to be followed by our lending officers that require senior management review of proposed extensions of credit exceeding certain thresholds. When delinquencies exist, we monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. Our loan review procedures include approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors of our bank, an independent loan review, approval of larger credit relationships by our bank’s Credit Committee and loan quality documentation procedures. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to the risk that our loan portfolio will be subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. 52 We target small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of such businesses and other consumers and high net worth individuals as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive or economic pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We use an independent consulting firm to review our loans for quality in addition to the reviews that may be conducted internally and by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process. Our bank has procedures and processes in place intended to assess whether losses exceed the potential amounts documented in our bank’s impairment analyses and to reduce potential losses in the remaining performing loans within our loan portfolio. These procedures and processes include the following: • we monitor the past due and overdraft reports on a weekly basis to identify deterioration as early as possible and the placement of identified loans on the watch list; • we perform quarterly credit reviews for all watch list/classified loans, including formulation of action plans. When a workout is not achievable, we move to collection/foreclosure proceedings to obtain control of the underlying collateral as rapidly as possible to minimize the deterioration of collateral and/or the loss of its value; • we require updated financial information, global inventory aging and interest carry analysis where appropriate for existing borrowers to help identify potential future loan payment problems; and • we generally limit loans for new construction to established builders and developers that have an established record of turning their inventories, and we restrict our funding of undeveloped lots and land. Our bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Our bank analyzes loans individually by classifying each loan as to credit risk. This analysis includes all commercial loans and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000, individually. This analysis is performed on a regular basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least an annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the risk rating of each loan in the sample. See “Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for a table that provides the risk category of loans by applicable class of loans. Non-Performing Loans and Assets Information summarizing non-performing assets, including non-accrual loans follows. December 31, 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Non-accrual loans $ 4,817 $ 1,464 $ 2,078 $ 2,695 $ 3,619 Troubled debt restructurings 1,928 2,717 1,391 1,206 1,272 Loans past due greater than 89 days and still accruing 3,296 38 214 231 — Non-performing loans 4,817 1,464 2,078 2,695 3,619 Foreclosed real estate 523 1,044 988 — — Non-performing assets $ 5,340 $ 2,508 $ 3,066 $ 2,695 $ 3,619 Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.25 % 0.10 % 0.15 % 0.28 % 0.39 % Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.18 % 0.12 % 0.16 % 0.20 % 0.27 % 53 The balance of non-performing assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. We have established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on loans (that is, place the loans on non-accrual status) after they have become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loans are considered to be well-collateralized and are in the process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In addition, a loan will not be placed on non-accrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of all principal and interest is not expected in a timely manner . Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against interest income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. If we believe that a loan will not be collected in full, we will increase the allowance for loan losses to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied directly to principal. As of December 31, 20 20 , there were not any loans, outside of those included in the table above, that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with present repayment terms. Due to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. The effect of these changes is assessed to determine if the loan should be classified as a Troubled Debt Restructure. Loans that have been restructured that are on non-accruing status as of the date of restructuring, are included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and are classified as impaired loans. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired. Allowance for Loan Losses (allowance) Our allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above and in Notes 1 and 4 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” The following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods and dates indicated. Year ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Total loans outstanding, net of unearned income $ 1,891,019 $ 1,420,102 $ 1,429,794 $ 947,537 $ 935,251 Average loans outstanding, net of unearned income 1,695,998 1,451,821 1,134,836 987,710 888,541 Allowance for loan and lease losses at beginning of period 12,604 12,113 13,721 11,634 10,132 Charge-offs: Commercial real estate — — — — 350 Consumer real estate 49 39 — — — Construction and land development — — — — — Commercial and industrial 728 455 4,831 12,769 956 Consumer 172 164 84 — 146 Other 277 140 39 — — Total charge-offs 1,226 798 4,954 12,769 1,452 Recoveries: Commercial real estate 10 23 22 9 52 Consumer real estate 14 20 4 — — Construction and land development — — — — — Commercial and industrial 235 380 395 1,865 23 Consumer 76 82 75 112 50 Other 53 23 8 — — Total recoveries 388 528 504 1,986 125 Net charge-offs 838 270 4,450 10,783 1,327 Provision for loan and lease losses 11,479 761 2,842 12,870 2,829 Allowance for loan and lease losses at period end $ 23,245 $ 12,604 $ 12,113 $ 13,721 $ 11,634 Allowance for loan and lease losses to period end loans 1.23 % 0.89 % 0.85 % 1.45 % 1.24 % Net charge-offs to average loans 0.05 % 0.02 % 0.39 % 1.09 % 0.15 % 54 See “Provision for Loan losses” above for discussion of the changes in the provision for loan losses. While no portion of our allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following tables represent management’s allocation of our allowance to specific loan categories for the periods indicated.

Management believes that allocations for each loan category are reasonable and reflective of risk inherent in the portfolio. Deposits Client deposits are the primary funding source for our loan growth. The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on deposits for each of the following categories for the periods indicated. Year ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Types of Deposits: Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 558,416 0.00 % $ 315,031 0.00 % $ 262,280 0.00 % Interest-bearing demand deposits 744,144 0.52 % 499,468 1.51 % 330,952 1.26 % Money market accounts 463,183 1.10 % 444,685 1.62 % 409,055 1.33 % Savings accounts 86,350 0.11 % 49,902 0.08 % 14,997 0.09 % Time deposits, $100,000 and over 293,901 1.61 % 267,509 2.21 % 177,366 1.76 % Time deposits, less than $100,000 113,323 0.51 % 94,447 1.72 % 50,395 1.63 % Total deposits $ 2,259,317 0.64 % $ 1,671,042 1.34 % $ 1,245,045 0.73 % Total average deposits increased 35.2% in 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 34.2% in 2019 compared to 2018. Much of the growth in deposits in 2020 is related to our acquisitions of FCB and BOW. However, we have been able to increase average noninterest-bearing demand deposits each year as we focus on building and expanding client relationships. The Target Market is an already competitive market, which has been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has led to liquidity concerns and excess deposits, as consumer confidence is low and the future economy remains uncertain. The following table presents the maturities of our time deposits as of December 31, 2020. December 31, 2020 Three months or less Over three through six months Over six through twelve months Over twelve months Total Time deposits, $100,000 or more $ 106,697 $ 66,675 $ 110,868 $ 57,063 $ 341,303 Time deposits, less than $100,000 29,098 23,912 39,914 35,301 128,225 Total $ 135,795 $ 90,587 $ 150,782 $ 92,364 $ 469,528 55 Capital Adequacy As of December 31, 2020, CapStar Financial’s capital ratios were as follows.

Market and Liquidity Risk Management Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of our established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our ALCO is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure an acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. Interest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis Managing interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity while attempting to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer requirements. We use earnings at risk, or EAR, simulations to assess the impact of changing rates on earnings under a variety of scenarios and time horizons. The simulation model is designed to reflect the dynamics of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments. These simulations utilize both instantaneous and parallel changes in the level of interest rates, as well as non-parallel changes such as changing slopes and twists of the yield curve. Static simulation models are based on current exposures and assume a constant balance sheet with no new growth. Dynamic simulation models are also utilized that rely on detailed assumptions regarding changes in existing products, new business, and changes in management and client behavior. By estimating the effects of interest rate increases and decreases, the model can reveal approximate interest rate risk exposure. The simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in interest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and does not indicate actual expected results. At December 31, 2020, our EAR static simulation results indicated that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to parallel shifts in interest rates. This indicates that our assets generally reprice faster than our liabilities, which results in a favorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates increase and an unfavorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates decline. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity and decay rates, and key rate drivers. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may, and most likely will, differ from our static EAR results. In addition, static EAR results do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client behavior. For example, as part of our asset/liability management strategy, management has the ability to increase asset duration and/or decrease liability duration in order to reduce asset sensitivity, or to decrease asset duration and/or increase liability duration in order to increase asset sensitivity. 56 The following table illustrates the results of our EAR analysis to determine the extent to which our net interest income over the next 12 months would change if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts. Net interest income change Increase 200bp 4.6% Increase 100bp 2.0 Decrease 100bp (2.2) Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. To manage liquidity risk, management has established a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is fully integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; appropriate strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems (including assessments of the current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are commensurate with the complexity and business activities of the Bank; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; adequate levels of highly liquid marketable securities free of legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that can be used to meet liquidity needs in stressful situations; comprehensive contingency funding plans that sufficiently address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes sufficient to determine the adequacy of the institution’s liquidity risk management process. The role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors’ withdrawal and borrowers’ credit demands while at the same time optimizing financial results within our corporate guidelines. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of those funds. Liquidity is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, investment securities available-for-sale, various lines of credit available to us, and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally deposits. Our most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, available-for-sale marketable investment securities and federal funds sold. The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was $486.2 million at December 31, 2020. We pledge portions of our investment securities portfolio to secure public fund deposits, derivative positions and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. At December 31, 2020, total investment securities pledged for these purposes comprised 33% of the estimated fair value of the entire investment portfolio, leaving $325.2 million of unpledged securities. We have a large base of non-maturity customer deposits, defined as demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts. At December 31, 2020, such deposits totaled $2.1 billion and represented 82% of our total deposits. Other sources of funds available to meet daily needs include FHLB advances. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, the Company has access to credit products offered by the FHLB. The Company views these borrowings as a low cost alternative to other time deposits. At December 31, 2020, available credit from the FHLB totaled $433.9 million. Additionally, we had available federal funds purchased lines with correspondent banks totaling $125 million at December 31, 2020. The principal source of cash for CapStar Financial is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. At December 31, 2020, the Bank was able to pay up to $49.6 million in dividends to CapStar Financial without regulatory approval subject to the ongoing capital requirements of the Bank. Accordingly, management believes that our funding sources are at sufficient levels to satisfy our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 57 Contractual Obligations The following table presents additional information about contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, which by their terms have contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2020.

The maximum month end balance represents the high indebtedness of borrowed funds at any time during each of the periods shown. Stated period end rates are contractual rates.

We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our clients. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold. We enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon clients maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. In the event that the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the client. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. We minimize our exposure to loss under loan commitments and standby letters of credit by subjecting them to the same credit approval and monitoring procedures as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses. The effect on our revenue, expenses, cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. 58 Our off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated. Contract or notional amount December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 804,520 $ 672,933 $ 707,675 Standby letters of credit 10,403 9,634 12,273 Total $ 814,923 $ 682,567 $ 719,948 Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Report includes the following financial measures that have been prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“non-GAAP financial measures”): tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible common equity per share. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enable a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business, and (iii) allow investors to evaluate the Company’s performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators; however, the Company acknowledges that its non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. The following table presents a reconciliation of tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible book value per share of common stock to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Impact of Inflation The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. ITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting under PCAOB standards. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Elliott Davis, LLC We have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.

financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 include CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and it’s wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank (the “Bank”, together referred to as the “Company”). Significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. On February 5, 2016 , CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. acquired all of the Bank’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, preferred stock, common stock options and warrants, and the Bank became the wholly owned subsidiary of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (the “Share Exchange”). The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Under this method, all identifiable assets acquired, including purchased loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The Company typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of shares of common stock issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition. Nature of Operations Through the Bank, the Company provides full banking services to consumer and corporate customers located primarily in Tennessee. The Bank operates under a state bank charter and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a state member bank, the Bank is subject to regulations of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, determination of impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, the valuation of our investment portfolio and deferred tax assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds sold are purchased and sold for one-day periods. The Company maintains deposits in excess of the federal insurance amounts with other financial institutions. Management makes deposits only with financial institutions it considers to be financially sound. 68 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Securities The Bank accounts for securities under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities . Under the provisions of FASB ASC 320, securities are to be classified in three categories and accounted for as follows: Securities Held-to-Maturity - Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity securities when the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Trading Securities - Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. No securities have been classified as trading securities. Securities Available-for-Sale - Debt securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities. Securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Realized gains and losses from the sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific-identification method. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and any collateral underlying the relevant security. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: (1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and (2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. 69 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Loans Held For Sale and Fair Value Option The Company classifies loans as loans held for sale when originated with the intent to sell. As of April 1, 2019, the Company elected the fair value option for all residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. This election allows for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. The Company has not elected the fair value option for other loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using derivative instruments. The fair value of residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell is based on traded market prices of similar assets. Other loans held for sale that are recorded at lower of cost or fair value may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when the fair value is less than cost. For further information, see Note 23 - Fair Value. The Company does not securitize mortgage loans. If the Company sells loans with servicing rights retained, the carrying value of the mortgage loan sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets. The changes in fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income and included gains of $ 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $ 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no loans held for sale recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the difference between the fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for residential real estate loans held for sale as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands): Fair Value Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance Difference December 31, 2020 Residential mortgage loans held for sale $ 97,303 $ 94,248 $ 3,055 December 31, 2019 Residential mortgage loans held for sale 30,740 30,178 562 Tri-Net Fees Tri-Net fees are derived from the origination, with the intent to sell, of commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Realized gains and losses are recognized when legal title of the loan has transferred to the investor and sales proceeds have been received and are reflected in the accompanying statements of income in Tri-Net fees, net of related costs such as commission expenses. Loans that have not been sold at period end are classified as held for sale on the balance sheet and recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. Loans The Company has seven classes of loans for financial reporting purposes: commercial real estate, consumer real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, consumer, PPP, and other. The appropriate classification is determined based on the underlying collateral utilized to secure each loan. Commercial real estate loans are categorized as such based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial real estate also includes owner occupied commercial real estate. Consumer real estate consists primarily of 1-4 family residential properties including home equity lines of credit. Construction and land development loans include loans where the repayment is dependent on the successful completion and operation and/or sale of the related real estate project. Construction and land development loans include 1-4 family construction projects and commercial construction endeavors such as warehouses, apartments, office and retail space and land acquisition and development. Commercial and industrial loans include loans to business enterprises issued for commercial, industrial and/or other professional purposes. 70 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Consumer loans include all loans issued to individuals not included in the consumer real estate class. PPP loans originated through the CARES act and include partially, or fully forgivable loans used to cover payroll costs, rent, interest, utilities, and other qualifiable expenses. Other loans include all loans not included in the classes of loans above and leases. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest is typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful and collection is highly questionable. Amortization of deferred loan fees is discontinued when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Under the cash-basis method, interest income is recorded when the payment is received in cash. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Loans can also be returned to accrual status when they become well secured and in the process of collection. Acquired Loans Acquired loans are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on assumptions regarding the amount and timing of principal and interest payments, estimated prepayments, estimated default rates, estimated loss severity in the event of defaults, and current market rates. Estimated credit losses are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded on the acquisition date. An acquired loan is considered purchased credit impaired when there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually or aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics such as loan type and risk rating. The Company estimates the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan or pool, and the expected cash flows in excess of amount paid (fair value) is recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool (accretable yield). The excess of the loan’s or pool’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (nonaccretable difference). Over the life of the loan or pool, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded as a provision for loan losses. If the present value of expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income. Acquired non-impaired loans are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisioning that may be required. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is maintained at a level that management believes to be adequate to absorb expected loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Quarterly, the Company estimates the allowance required using peer group loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. The Company’s historical loss 71 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions due to the Company’s limited loss history. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The Company also considers the results of the external independent loan review when assessing the adequacy of the allowance and incorporates relevant loan review results in the loan impairment and overall adequacy of allowance determinations. Furthermore, regulatory agencies periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to record adjustments to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. Additional considerations are included in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance based on the continuous review conducted by relationship managers and credit department personnel. The Company’s loan policy requires that each customer relationship wherein total exposure exceeds $ 1.5 million be subject to a formal credit review at least annually. Should these reviews identify potential collection concerns, appropriate adjustments to the allowance may be made. The allowance consists of specific and general components as discussed below. While the allowance consists of separate components, these terms are primarily used to describe a process. Both portions of the allowance are available to provide for inherent losses in the entire portfolio. Specific Component The specific component relates to loans that are individually determined to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans meeting any of the following criteria are individually evaluated for impairment: risk rated substandard (as defined in Note 4), on non-accrual status or past due greater than 90 days. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral less costs to sell if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Changes to the valuation allowance are recorded as a component of the provision for loan losses. TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. TDRs are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s effective rate at inception. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. General Component The general component of the allowance for loan losses covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Large groups of homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. The general allowance component also includes loans that are individually identified for impairment evaluation but are not considered impaired. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. Due to the Company’s limited loss history, the historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions. The Company utilized a 37 quarter look-back period as of December 31, 2018. Subsequently, the Company increased its look-back period to a total of 41 quarters and 45 quarters as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period was necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. This extension of the historical 72 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio. The actual loss experience is supplemented with other environmental factors that capture changes in trends, conditions, and other relevant factors that may cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from historical loss experience. The allocation for environmental factors is by nature subjective. These amounts represent estimated probable inherent credit losses, which exist but have not been captured in the historical loss experience. The environmental factors include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans, quality of the loan review system, value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations, and other external factors. Servicing Rights When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in other noninterest income. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported with other noninterest income on the income statement and the associated asset is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement within other noninterest income, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal; or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income. Net servicing fees totaled $ 148,000 , $ 340,000 , and $ 102,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively. Impairment charges associated with these servicing rights amounted to $ 238,000 and $ 211,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2018. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method based on the shorter of the asset lives or the expected lease terms. Useful lives for premises and equipment range from one to thirty-nine years . These assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)), which requires for all operating leases the recognition of a right-of-use (""ROU"") asset and a corresponding lease liability, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For short term leases (term of 12 months or less), a lessee is permitted to make an accounting election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The lease cost will be allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. There were further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01, “Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842” in January 2018. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, ""Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements"", which provides for the option to apply the new leasing standard to all open leases as of the adoption date, on a prospective basis. 73 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements On January 1, 2019 , the Company adopted the new accounting standard ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and all the related amendments (""new lease standard"", ""ASC 842"" or ""ASU 2016-02"") utilizing the practical expedient to apply the new lease standard as of January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis. The Company also elected the ""package of expedients"" and elected as an accounting policy to exclude recording ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases that meet the definition of short-term leases. In addition to excluding short-term leases, the Company has implemented an accounting policy in which non-lease components are not separated from lease components in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all lease contracts. The Company recognized $ 12.8 million in ROU assets and $ 13.4 million in lease liabilities as a result of applying the new lease standard as an adjustment to the opening consolidated balance sheet on January 1, 2019. The ROU assets and lease liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 7—Leases for additional disclosures related to leases. Bank Owned Life Insurance The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Bank owned life insurance is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase The Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase at a specified future date. Such repurchase agreements are considered financing arrangements and, accordingly, the obligation to repurchase assets sold is reflected as a liability in the balance sheets of the Bank. Repurchase agreements are collateralized by debt securities which are owned and under the control of the Bank and are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. Qualitative factors are assessed to first determine if it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value. At October 31, 2020, as a result of market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company determined it did not satisfy the more likely than not qualitative assessment that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. As a result, the Company elected to perform a quantitative assessment, which included a combination of quoted market prices of the Company’s stock, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other techniques. Based upon the results of the quantitative assessment, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, resulting in no impairment. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the balance sheet. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to ten years . Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned (“OREO”) includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and are recorded at estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Valuation adjustments required at foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, additional losses resulting from the periodic revaluation of the property are charged to other real estate expense. Costs of operating and maintaining the properties and any gains or losses recognized on disposition are also included in other real estate expense. Improvements made to properties are capitalized if the expenditures are expected to be recovered upon the sale of the properties. 74 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Restricted Equity Securities The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on an assessment of the ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System, and as such, holds stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“Federal Reserve Bank”). Federal Reserve Bank stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income. Income Taxes Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company’s tax returns remain open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS and various states for the years ended December 31, 2017 through 2020. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest, reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with performance vesting criteria, anticipated performance is projected to determine the number of awards expected to vest, and the corresponding aggregate expense is adjusted to reflect the elapsed portion of the performance period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $ 400,000 , $ 370,000 and $ 383,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively and is included in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance-sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received. Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps (“swaps”) to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these arrangements to meet customer needs, the Bank enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize market risk to the Bank. These swaps are derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments. 75 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Bank may also utilize cash flow hedges to manage its future interest rate exposure. These derivative contracts are designated as hedges and, as such, changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Bank prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges. The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness, along with support for management’s assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion, if any, would be recognized in current period earnings. The Bank discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended. When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as non-interest income. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. Cash flows resulting from the derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as hedges are classified in the cash flow statement in the same category as the cash flows of the items being hedged. Commitments to fund mortgage loans “interest rate locks” to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the sale of mortgage-backed securities are accounted for as free standing derivatives. The fair value of the interest rate lock is recorded at the time the commitment to fund the mortgage loan is executed and is adjusted for the expected exercise of the commitment before the loan is funded. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest rate on the loan is locked. The Company enters into forward commitments for the sale of mortgage-backed securities when interest rate locks are entered into, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in mortgage banking income. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on securities transferred to held to maturity and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges which are also recognized as separate components of equity. The Bank’s policy is to release the income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when the item is realized. Fair Value Measurements Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Restriction on Cash Balances Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Act requires that banks maintain reserve balances with their applicable Federal Reserve Bank based principally on the type and amount of their deposits. On March 15, 2020, the Board of the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020. This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions. The Bank was required to have a reserve balance of $ 73,444,000 at December 31, 2019. The reserve balance that the Bank must maintain at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is included in interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions as of December 31, 2019. Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure through March 5, 2021, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued. 76 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Income Per Common Share Basic net income per share available to common stockholders (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is attributable to convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of outstanding convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. No antidilutive stock options were excluded from calculation for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or December 31, 2018. The following is a summary of the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation for each of the following years (in thousands except share data): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Basic net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 24,696 $ 22,422 $ 9,655 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 20,162,038 17,886,164 13,277,614 Basic net income per share $ 1.22 $ 1.25 $ 0.73 Diluted net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 24,696 $ 22,422 $ 9,655 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 20,162,038 17,886,164 13,277,614 Dilutive shares contingently issuable 23,551 727,060 1,202,733 Average diluted common shares outstanding 20,185,589 18,613,224 14,480,347 Diluted net income per share $ 1.22 $ 1.20 $ 0.67 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance was effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company applied the guidance using a modified retrospective approach. The Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income. The scope of the guidance explicitly excludes net interest income as well as many other revenues for financial assets and liabilities including loans, leases, securities, and derivatives. Accordingly, the majority of our revenues will not be affected. The Company performed an assessment of our revenue contracts related to revenue streams that are within the scope of the standard. Our accounting policies did not change materially since the principles of revenue recognition from the ASU were largely consistent with existing guidance and current practices applied by our businesses. We did not identify material changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The Company records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic 606”). Under Topic 606, the Company must identify the contract with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Significant revenue has not been recognized in the current reporting period that results from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. The Company’s primary sources of revenue are derived from interest and dividends earned on loans, investment securities, and other financial instruments that are not within the scope of Topic 606. The Company evaluated the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income was not necessary. The Company generally fully satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as 77 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements services are rendered and the transaction prices are typically fixed; charged either on a periodic basis or based on activity. Our accounting policies did not change materially since the principles of revenue recognition f ro m the Accounting Standards Update were largely consistent with existing guidance and current practices applied by our business. A description of the Company’s revenue streams accounted for under Topic 606 follows: Treasury management and other deposit service charges: The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction based fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer’s request. Account maintenance fees are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies its performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer’s account balance. Interchange income: Included in other noninterest income are interchange fees, which the Company earns from debit cardholder transactions conducted through various payment networks. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing series provided to the cardholder. Gains/Losses on Sales of OREO: The Company records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Company finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Company assesses whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligation under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company adjusts the transaction price and related gain (loss) on sale if a significant financing component is present. ASU 2016-02, Leases In February 2016, the FASB amended the Leases topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to revise certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing transactions. The amendments were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method and practical expedients for transition. The practical expedients allow the Company to largely account for our existing leases consistent with current guidance except for the incremental balance sheet recognition for lessees. The Company evaluated the new guidance and its impact on the Company’s financial statements. Based on leases outstanding at December 31, 2018, the impact of adoption on January 1, 2019 was recording a lease liability of approximately $ 13.4 million, a right-of-use asset of approximately $ 12.8 million, and elimination of deferred rent of approximately $ 0.6 million. ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities. The amendments were originally supposed to be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for all organizations for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. However, in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates , which finalizes effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying the credit losses standard. The Company has elected to delay implementation of the new standard until 2023 and cannot currently predict the impact of the adoption. ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB amended the Goodwill and Other Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment for public business entities and other entities that have goodwill reported in their financial statements and have not elected the private company alternative for the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The amendment removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The effective date and transition requirements for the technical corrections were effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. These amendments did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. 78 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities In August 2017, the FASB amended the requirements of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments were effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted this standard December 1, 2017 . There was no material effect on the financial statements. ASU 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation In June 2018, the FASB amended the Compensation—Stock Compensation Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The guidance was effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. There was no material effect on the financial statements. ASU 2019-04 ― Applicable to entities that hold financial instruments: In April 2019, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to the recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging, and recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The amendments related to credit losses were effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments related to hedging were effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments related to recognition and measurement of financial instruments were effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. These amendments did not have a material effect on the financial statements. ASU 2019-05 ― Applicable to entities that hold financial instruments: In May 2019, the FASB issued guidance to provide entities with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments will be effective for the Company upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 in fiscal year 2023. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. ASU 2019-12 ― Applicable to entities within the scope of Topic 740, Income Taxes: In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing specific technical exceptions that often produce information investors have a hard time understanding. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. NOTE 2 – ACQUISITIONS FCB Merger Effective July 1, 2020, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 23, 2020 (the “FCB Merger Agreement”), by and between the Company and FCB Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (“FCB”), FCB was merged with and into CapStar, with CapStar continuing as the surviving entity (the “FCB Merger”). Immediately following the FCB Merger, The First National Bank of Manchester, a national banking association and a wholly owned subsidiary of FCB, merged with and into CapStar Bank, a Tennessee chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of CapStar (the “FNBM Merger”), with CapStar Bank continuing as the surviving entity in the FNBM Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the FCB Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the FCB Merger, shares of common stock, par value $ 10.00 per share, of FCB (“FCB Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the FCB Merger (other than shares of FCB Common Stock owned or held by FCB, CapStar and their subsidiaries (in each case, other than shares of FCB Common Stock held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of debts previously contracted) were collectively converted into the right to receive in the aggregate 2,966,918 shares of common stock, par value $ 1.00 per share, of CapStar (“CapStar Common Stock”), with cash (without interest) in lieu of fractional shares, and $ 22.2 million in cash, without interest . BOW Merger 79 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Effective July 1, 2020, following the FCB Merger, pursuant to the Plan of Bank Merger, dated as of January 23, 2020 (the “BOW Merger Agreement,” and together with the FCB Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreements”), by and among CapStar, CapStar Bank and The Bank of Waynesboro, a Tennessee chartered bank (“BOW”), BOW was merged with and into CapStar Bank, with CapStar Bank continuing as the surviving entity (the “BOW Merger,” and together with the FCB Merger, the “Mergers”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the BOW Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the BOW Merger, shares of common stock, par value $ 10.00 per share, of BOW (“BOW Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the BOW Merger (other than shares of BOW Common Stock owned or held by CapStar, CapStar Bank, BOW and their subsidiaries (in each case, other than shares of BOW Common Stock held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of debts previously contracted)) were collectively converted into the right to receive in the aggregate 664,800 shares of CapStar Common Stock, with cash (without interest) in lieu of fractional shares, and $ 5.1 million in cash, without interest. Total acquisition consideration resulting from the Mergers amounted to approximately $ 70.9 million . With the acquisitions, the Company further expanded its franchise in the Middle Tennessee market. FCB’s and BOW’s results of operations were included in the Company’s results beginning July 1, 2020. Acquisition related costs of $ 5.4 million are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The fair value of the common shares issued as part of the consideration paid for the Mergers was determined by the closing price of the Company’s common shares immediately preceding the acquisition date Goodwill of $ 3.6 million associated with the Mergers is not amortizable for book or tax purposes. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for the Mergers and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date (in thousands).

(b) The amount represents the adjustment of the net book value of the acquired loans to their estimated fair value based on interest rates and expected cash flows at the date of acquisition. (c) The amount represents the removal of FCB and BOW’s existing allowance for loan losses. (d) The amount represents the adjustment of the net book value of acquired premises and equipment to their estimated fair value. 80 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (e) The amount represents the adjustment of recording the fair value of the core deposit intangible representing the intangible value of the deposit base acquired and the fair value of the customer relationship. (f) The amount represents the net adjustment of the deferred tax asset recognized on the fair value adjustments on acquired assets and assumed liabilities. (g) The amount represents the adjustment necessary because the weighted average interest rate of acquired time deposits exceeded the cost of similar funding at the time of acquisition. The fair value adjustment will be amortized to reduce future interest expense over the life of the portfolio.

The amount of the impairment of available for sale securities related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The unrealized losses shown above are primarily due to increases in market rates over the yields available at the time of purchase of the underlying securities and not credit quality. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2020 . There were no other-than-temporary impairments for the years ended December 31, 2020 , 2019 or 201 8 . NOTE 4 – LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES Loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Commercial real estate $ 643,832 $ 559,899 Consumer real estate 343,791 256,097 Construction and land development 174,859 143,111 Commercial and industrial 630,775 394,408 Consumer 44,279 28,426 Other 53,483 38,161 Total 1,891,019 1,420,102 Allowance for loan losses ( 23,245 ) ( 12,604 ) Total loans, net $ 1,867,774 $ 1,407,498 The CARES Act created a new guaranteed, unsecured loan program under the SBA called the Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”), which the Company participates in, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the pandemic period. The SBA has guaranteed 100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP by lenders to eligible small businesses. One of the notable features of the PPP is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if certain conditions are met related to retaining staff and if loan amounts are used to cover eligible expenses, such as payroll, mortgage interest, rents and utilities payments. These loans have a two-year term and will earn interest at a rate of 1 %. The Company assisted customers with applications for resources through the program and funded 1,475 loans. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of loans originated under the PPP totaled $ 185.5 million and was included in commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, PPP borrowers are not required to pay any fees to the government or the lender and the loans may be repaid by the borrower at any time. The SBA, however, will pay lenders a processing fee based on the size of the PPP loan, ranging from 1 % to 5 % of the loan. Unamortized fees associated with PPP loans included in total loans were $ 4.0 million as of December 31, 2020. These fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan. PPP fees recognized as income totaled $ 3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is assessed at the end of each quarter. The ALL includes a specific component related to loans that are individually evaluated for impairment and a general component related to loans that are segregated into homogenous pools and collectively evaluated for impairment. The ALL factors applied to these pools are an estimate of probable incurred losses based on management’s evaluation of historical net losses from loans with similar characteristics, which are adjusted by management to reflect current events, trends, and conditions. The adjustments include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans, quality of the loan review system, value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations, and other external factors. The Company’s evaluation of other external factors included consideration of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic and the resulting impact on the Company’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020, which is largely uncertain due to rapidly evolving conditions. 83 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements At December 31, 2020 , variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $ 1,199,105,000 and $ 691,914,000 , respec tively. At December 31, 201 9 , variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $ 785,329,000 and $ 634,773,000 , respectively. The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes all commercial loans, and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $ 500,000 , individually and assigns each loan a risk rating. This analysis is performed on a continual basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least an annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the loan’s risk rating. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention – A special mention asset possesses deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving of management’s attention. If uncorrected, such weaknesses or deficiencies may expose the Company to an increased risk of loss in the future. Substandard – A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. Doubtful – A doubtful asset has all weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is extremely high, but certain important and reasonable specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset exist, therefore, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. Loans not falling into the criteria above are considered to be pass-rated loans. The Company utilizes six loan grades within the pass risk rating.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company had recorded investments in TDR of $ 1.9 million and $ 2.7 million, respectively. The Company did no t allocate a specific allowance for those loans at December 31, 2020 or 2019 and there were no commitments to lend additional amounts. Loans accounted for as TDR include modifications from original terms such as those due to bankruptcy proceedings, certain modifications of amortization periods or extended suspension of principal payments due to customer financial difficulties. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company’s loan policy. Loans accounted for as TDR are individually evaluated for impairment. In accordance with interagency guidance, short term deferrals granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic are not considered TDRs unless the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty prior to the pandemic. The following table presents loans by class modified as TDR that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands). There were no TDR loans identified during the year ended December 31, 2018.

A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms. Acquired Loans On July 1, 2020, the Company acquired FCB and BOW (see Note 2 for more information). As a result of the acquisitions, the Company recorded loans with a fair value of $ 294.7 million. Of those loans, $ 33.6 million were considered to be purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are loans for which it is probable at the acquisition date that all contractually required payments will not be collected. The remaining loans are considered to be purchased non-impaired loans and their related fair value discount or premium is recognized as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of each loan. 89 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following table relates to acquired FCB and BOW PCI loans and summarizes the contractually required payments, which includes principal and interest, expected cash flows to be collected, and the fair value of acquired PCI loans at the acquisition date (in thousands): FCB and BOW acquired on July 1, 2020 Contractually required payments $ 42,443 Nonaccretable difference 4,501 Cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition 37,942 Accretable yield 4,349 Fair value of PCI loans at acquisition date $ 33,593 The following table relates to acquired FCB and BOW purchased non-impaired loans and provides the contractually required payments, fair value, and estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected at the acquisition date (in thousands): FCB and BOW acquired on July 1, 2020 Contractually required payments $ 296,527 Fair value of acquired loans at acquisition date 260,701 Contractual cash flows not expected to be collected 3,718 The following table presents changes in the carrying value of PCI loans (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2020 Balance at beginning of period $ 1,605 Additions due to the acquisitions 33,593 Change due to payments received and accretion ( 6,806 ) Balance at end of period $ 28,392 The following table presents changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2020 Balance at beginning of period $ 915 Additions due to the acquisitions 4,349 Accretion ( 1,196 ) Balance at end of period $ 4,068 PCI loans had no impact on the ALL for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.

Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. Qualitative factors are assessed to first determine if it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value. At October 31, 2020, as a result of market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company determined it did not satisfy the more likely than not qualitative assessment that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. As a result, the Company elected to perform a quantitative assessment, which included a combination of quoted market prices of the Company’s stock, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other techniques. Based upon the results of the quantitative assessment, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, resulting in no impairment. 92 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Acquired Intangible Assets Acquired intangible assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Amortized intangible assets: Core deposit intangibles $ 12,837 $ ( 4,207 ) $ 9,267 $ ( 2,384 ) For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, amortization expense was $ 1,824,000 , $ 1,655,000 and $ 465,000 .

The CARES Act permits NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 to be carried back five taxable years. This enabled the Company to carry back losses incurred during the taxable year 2018 to prior years with a higher statutory tax rate, creating a permanent tax rate benefit. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 0.8 million related to the permanent tax rate benefit during the period ended March 31, 2020. In addition to the permanent tax rate benefit, the effective tax rate compared favorably to the statutory rate due to investments in qualified municipal securities, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. 96 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Significant items that gave rise to deferred taxes at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 5,040 $ 2,935 Net operating loss carryforward 527 738 Organization and preopening costs 261 359 Stock-based compensation 48 200 Acquired loans 939 871 Accrued contributions 288 247 Acquired deposits 459 — Accrued compensation 3,159 22 Other 148 167 Deferred tax assets 10,869 5,539 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation 1,633 804 Goodwill 311 154 Unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale 2,009 833 Amortization of core deposit intangible 1,608 1,052 Other acquired assets 509 — Other 201 568 Deferred tax liabilities 6,271 3,411 Net deferred tax asset $ 4,598 $ 2,128 At December 31, 2020, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 2,511,000 , which expire at various dates from 2030 to 2032 . Deferred tax assets are fully recognized because the benefits are more likely than not to be realized based on management’s estimation of future taxable earnings. There were no significant unrecognized income tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for instruments that are included in the balance sheet. The following table sets forth outstanding financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands): Contract or notional amount December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 804,520 $ 672,933 Standby letters of credit 10,403 9,634 Total $ 814,923 $ 682,567 The Company is party to litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from such litigation and claims as of December 31, 2020, will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company. 97 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 15 – CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Substantially all of the Company’s loans, commitments, and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Company’s market areas. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4 to the financial statements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions aggregated $ 243,000,000 and $ 86,000,000 , respectively, in excess of insured limits. NOTE 16 – REGULATORY MATTERS AND RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the Bank is also subject to the regulatory capital requirements of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory – and possibly additional discretionary – actions by regulators that could, in that event, have a material adverse effect on the institutions’ financial statements. The relevant regulations require the Company and the Bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting principles. The capital classifications of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by their regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Those qualitative judgments could also affect the capital status of the Company and the Bank and the amount of dividends the Company and the Bank may distribute. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Companying Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. Banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, federal banking regulators have established five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company and the Bank were well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Company’s or the Bank’s category. 98 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table (dollars in thousands): Actual Minimum capital requirement (1) Minimum to be well-capitalized (2) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio At December 31, 2020: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 338,426 16.03 % $ 168,910 8.0 % N/A N/A CapStar Bank 324,152 15.36 168,808 8.0 211,010 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 285,439 13.52 126,682 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 300,588 14.25 126,606 6.0 168,808 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 285,439 13.52 95,012 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 284,088 13.46 94,954 4.5 137,156 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 285,439 9.60 118,877 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 300,588 10.12 118,780 4.0 148,476 5.0 At December 31, 2019: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 237,857 13.45 % $ 141,436 8.0 % N/A N/A CapStar Bank 224,443 12.70 141,388 8.0 176,735 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 225,074 12.73 106,077 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 211,660 11.98 106,041 6.0 141,388 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 225,074 12.73 79,558 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 195,160 11.04 79,531 4.5 114,878 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 225,074 11.37 79,201 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 211,660 10.70 79,150 4.0 98,938 5.0 (1) For the calendar year 2020, the Company was required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of Tier 1 common equity capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 1.875 % to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees. (2) For the Company to be well-capitalized, the Bank must be well-capitalized and the Company must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Under Tennessee banking law, the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions is limited to the current year’s net income, combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. The Bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that Company holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Based on these regulations, the Bank was eligible to pay $ 49.6 million and $ 35.8 million of dividends as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Bank paid the Company $ 4.1 million of dividends during 2020. 99 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 17 – NONVOTING AND SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCK WARRANTS Nonvoting Common Stock The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of its common stock as nonvoting common stock. The nonvoting common stock has the same rights and privileges as the common stock other than the nonvoting designation. Under certain conditions, as outlined in the Company’s charter, the nonvoting stock may be converted, on a one-to-one basis , to common stock. In conjunction with the Company’s initial public offering, 79,166 shares of nonvoting common stock were issued and simultaneously converted to common stock on a one-to-one basis as further described under “Warrants” below. During 2019, 132,561 shares of nonvoting common stock were converted to common stock. As a result, at December 31, 2020, there were no shares of nonvoting common stock outstanding. Preferred Stock In conjunction with its initial capital issuance in 2008, the Bank issued 1,609,756 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to certain shareholders. During 2016, coinciding with the Company’s initial public offering, 731,707 preferred shares were converted to common shares. During 2019, 878,048 preferred shares were converted to common shares. As a result, at December 31, 2020, there was no Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. NOTE 18 – STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES During 2008, the board of directors of the Company approved the CapStar Bank 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. Following the formation of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. in 2016, and in connection with the Share Exchange, the outstanding awards of restricted stock and stock options under the CapStar Bank 2008 Stock Incentive Plan were exchanged for similar awards of restricted stock and stock options issued by CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. under the Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which the board of directors adopted in 2016. The Plan provides for the grant of stock-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance awards and restricted stock, to employees, directors and service providers that are subject to forfeiture until vesting conditions have been satisfied by the award recipient under the terms of the award. The Plan is intended to help align the interests of employees and our shareholders and reward our employees for improved Company performance. The Plan reserved 1,569,475 shares of stock for issuance of stock incentives. Stock incentives include both restricted stock and stock option grants. During 2018 the board of directors approved the addition of 400,000 shares of stock for issuance of stock incentives under the Plan. Total shares issuable under the plan were 242,325 at December 31, 2020. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, within salaries and employee benefits for employees, and within other non-interest expense for directors, in the consolidated statements of income as follows (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 1,223 $ 1,262 $ 2,079 Less: deferred tax benefit ( 320 ) ( 330 ) ( 543 ) Reduction of net income $ 903 $ 932 $ 1,536 100 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Restricted Shares , Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Stock Units We grant time-vested restricted stock units and performance stock units to certain key employees and directors under our stock award plan. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at the issue date. Those granted after January 1, 2020, vest ratably over a two or three-year vesting period depending on the specific award. Performance stock units vest based upon the attainment of certain performance metrics over a three-year cumulative performance period. Certain of these awards are eligible to receive dividend equivalent shares. The grant date fair value of these awards approximates the market value of the shares. For awards based upon the achievement of the performance goals, the awards are earned ratably from 0 % to 188 %. If the performance goals are met at the end of the performance period, the award is adjusted to reflect the Company’s three-year total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to a capital market peer group. This TSR modifier cannot cause the award to exceed the maximum of 188 %. The recipients have the right to vote and receive dividends but cannot sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber the restricted stock until the shares have vested. A summary of the changes in the Company’s nonvested stock awards for 2020 follows: Weighted Average Restricted Grant Date Nonvested Shares Shares Fair Value Nonvested at beginning of period 84,697 $ 17.44 Granted 144,557 13.73 Vested ( 76,715 ) 16.50 Forfeited ( 4,125 ) 14.45 Nonvested at end of period 148,414 $ 14.39 As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 1.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 997,000 , $, 1,352,000 and $ 2,804,000 , respectively. Stock Options Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Option awards generally have a three year vesting period and a ten year contractual term. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on calculations performed by management using industry data. The expected term of options granted was calculated using the “simplified” method for plain vanilla options as permitted under authoritative literature. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted average assumptions as of the grant date. There were no options granted during 2020. The Company granted 50,000 options during 2019. 2019 Dividend yield 1.35 % Expected term (in years) 6.50 Expected stock price volatility 29.55 % Risk-free interest rate 2.25 % 101 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements A summary of the activity in stock options for 2020 follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Exercise Contractual Shares Price Term (years) Outstanding at beginning of period 271,202 $ 11.22 Granted — — Exercised ( 24,613 ) 6.75 Forfeited or expired ( 20,000 ) 10.92 Outstanding at end of period 226,589 $ 11.73 3.9 Fully vested and expected to vest 226,589 $ 11.73 3.9 Exercisable at end of period 193,255 $ 11.19 3.1 Information related to stock options during 2020, 2019 and 2018 follows: 2020 2019 2018 Intrinsic value of options exercised $ 188,662 $ 2,478,086 $ 7,654,738 Cash received from option exercises 105,847 1,930,737 6,897,845 Tax benefit realized from option exercises 16,524 103,847 846,725 Weighted average fair value of options granted — 5.35 — As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 124,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. NOTE 19 – EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain senior executives with various expiration dates. Most of the contracts have an option for annual renewal by mutual agreement. The agreements specify that in certain terminating events the Company will be obligated to provide certain benefits and pay each of the senior executives severance based on their annual salaries. These terminating events include termination of employment without “Cause” (as defined in the agreements) or in certain other circumstances specified in the agreements. NOTE 20 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a Retirement Savings 401(k) Plan in which employees may participate. The Company has elected a safe harbor 401(k) plan and as such is required to make an annual contribution of 3 % of the employees’ salaries annually. An employee does not have to contribute to receive the employer contribution. In addition, the Company may make an additional discretionary contribution up to 6 % of the employees’ salaries annually. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company contributed $ 801,000 , $ 874,000 and $ 639,000 , respectively, to the 401(k) Plan. The Company also has a Health Reimbursement Plan in place to offset the cost of healthcare deductibles for employees. At the end of the year, up to one-half of the unused balance in the employee’s account will be available for the following year up to a maximum of the deductible for that employee. 102 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 21 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate swap agreements. Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges There were no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. The company previously terminated an interest rate swap during 2019, which resulted in a termination fee of $ 1.5 million which continued to be amortized as the corresponding hedged items, consisting of LIBOR-based brokered deposits and FHLB borrowings, were expected to remain outstanding until the initial maturities of the terminated swaps. However, during the year ended December 31, 2020, it was determined that in light of the Company’s surplus liquidity position this funding was expected to be terminated at the next renewal date and thus the previously terminated interest rate swaps which had been designated as cash flow hedges were no longer deemed effective, therefore, remaining unrealized losses of $ 1.9 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income were recognized in net income. There are no unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2020. Other Interest Rate Swaps The Company also enters into swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these transactions the Company enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize risk to the Company. A summary of the Company’s customer related interest rate swaps is as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Notional Estimated Notional Estimated amount fair value amount fair value Interest rate swap agreements: Pay fixed/receive variable swaps $ 59,946 $ ( 2,740 ) $ 45,053 $ ( 926 ) Pay variable/receive fixed swaps 59,946 2,740 45,053 926 Total $ 119,892 $ — $ 90,106 $ — Mortgage Banking Derivatives The Company enters into various derivative agreements with customers in the form of interest-rate lock commitments which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. The derivatives are valued using a model that utilizes market interest rates and other unobservable inputs. Changes in the fair value of these commitments due to fluctuations in interest rates that are to be originated to our loans held for sale portfolio are economically hedged through the use of forward sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities. The gains and losses arising from this derivative activity are reflected in current period earnings under mortgage banking income. Interest rate lock commitments are valued using a model with significant unobservable market parameters. Forward sale commitments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable. The net gains (losses) relating to mortgage banking derivative instruments included in mortgage banking income were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended For the year ended December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments $ 1,959 $ 648 Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments ( 478 ) ( 148 ) Total $ 1,481 $ 500 There were no gains or losses relating to mortgage banking derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2018. 103 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The amount and fair value of mortgage banking derivatives included in the consolidated balance sheets was as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Notional Estimated Notional Estimated amount fair value amount fair value Included in other assets: Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments $ 88,303 $ 2,607 $ 44,694 $ 648 Included in other liabilities: Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments $ 87,000 $ ( 626 ) $ 38,500 $ ( 148 ) NOTE 22 – RELATED PARTY The Company may enter into loan transactions with certain directors, executive officers, significant shareholders, and their affiliates. Such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Company, and did not, in the opinion of management, involve more than normal credit risk or present other unfavorable features. None of these loans were impaired at December 31, 2020 or 2019. Activity within these loans during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in thousands): Total commitment Total funded commitment Year ended December 31, 2020 Beginning of period $ 21,815 $ 10,673 New commitments/draw downs 200 2,798 Repayments ( 3,991 ) ( 3,689 ) End of period $ 18,024 $ 9,782 Year ended December 31, 2019 Beginning of period $ 44,812 $ 15,445 New commitments/draw downs 9,336 2,515 Repayments ( 32,333 ) ( 7,287 ) End of period $ 21,815 $ 10,673 Deposits from directors, executive officers, significant shareholders and their affiliates at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $ 38.5 million and $ 13.7 million, respectively. NOTE 23 – FAIR VALUE Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2: Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 104 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Investment Securities : The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2), using matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded and values debt securities by relying on quoted prices for the specific securities and the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). See below for additional discussion of Level 3 valuation methodologies and significant inputs. The fair values of all securities are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Derivatives-Interest Rate Swaps : The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). The Company’s derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair values of all interest rate swaps are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Impaired Loans : The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the loan policy. Other Real Estate Owned : Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Appraisals may be adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and/or management’s expertise and knowledge of the collateral. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. The Company had no other real estate owned carried at fair value at December 31, 2020 or 2019. Loans Held For Sale : Loans held for sale are carried at either fair value, if elected, or the lower of cost or fair value on a pool-level basis. Origination fees and costs for loans held for sale recorded at lower of cost or market are capitalized in the basis of the loan and are included in the calculation of realized gains and losses upon sale. Origination fees and costs are recognized in earnings at the time of origination for loans held for sale that are recorded at fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other observable market data, such as outstanding commitments from third party investors (Level 2). Derivatives-Mortgage Loan Interest Rate Lock Commitments : Interest rate lock commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are recorded at fair value, determined as the amount that would be required to settle each derivative instrument at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is derived from the fair value of related mortgage loans, which is based on observable market data and includes the expected net future cash flows related to servicing of the loans. In estimating the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment, the Company assigns a probability to the interest rate lock commitment based on an expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded (a “pull through” rate). The expected pull through 105 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements rates are applied to the fair value of the unclosed mortgage pipeline, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e., the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Changes to the fair value of interest rate lock commitments are recognized based on interest rate changes, changes in the probability that the commitment will be exercised, and the passage of time. Derivatives-Mortgage-Backed Securities Forward Sales Commitments : The Company utilizes mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments to hedge mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments. Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments are recorded at fair value based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable, resulting in a Level 2 fair value classification. .

(b) Federal Funds Sold Federal funds sold clear on a daily basis. For this reason, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. (c) Restricted Equity Securities It is not practical to determine the fair value of restricted securities due to restrictions placed on their transferability. (d) Loans, net In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the fair value of loans is measured using an exit price notion. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models or based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. (e) Accrued interest receivable The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value. (f) Other Assets Included in other assets are bank owned life insurance and certain interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. For bank owned life insurance, the carrying amount is based on the cash surrender value and is a reasonable estimate of fair value. (g) Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated by discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates with similar remaining maturities. (h) Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Borrowings The fair value of fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and other borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates, advances and other borrowings with similar remaining maturities. (i) Other Liabilities Included in other liabilities are accrued interest payable and certain interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. (j) Off-Balance Sheet Instruments Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material. (k) Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of 109 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on estimating on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, fixed assets are not considered financial instruments and their value has not been incorporated into the fair value estimates. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in 2013. This assessment included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. Based on the assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Elliott Davis, LLC, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Report. Their report is included in “Part II, Item 8. — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for an Emerging Growth Company.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, statements relating to the Company’s assets business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, short and long-term performance goals, prospects, results of operations, strategic initiatives, the benefits, cost and synergies of completed acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing, benefits, costs and synergies of future acquisitions, disposition and other growth opportunities. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “aspire,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “projection,” “forecast,” “roadmap,” “goal,” “target,” “would,” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based upon current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. The inclusion of these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that such expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and that are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date of this Report, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: The Company may not capitalize on opportunities to enhance market share in certain markets and the Company’s services may not be generally accepted in new markets; the ability of the Company to meet expectations regarding the benefits, costs, synergies and financial and operational impact of the FCB Corporation (“FCB”) and the Bank of Waynesboro (“BOW”) mergers;

the significant portion of our loan portfolio that ii originated during the past two years and the refore may less reliably predict future collectability than older loans; the adequacy of reserves (including our allowance for loan losses) and the appropriateness of our methodology for calculating such reserves; non-performing loans and leases; non-perfo rming assets; charge-offs, non-accruals, troubled debt restructurings, impairments and other credit-related issues; adverse trends in the healthcare service industry, which is an integral component of our Target M arket’s economy and which could adversely a ffect the business operations of certain of our key borrowers ; our management of risks inherent in our commercial real estate loan portfolio, and the risk of a prolonged downturn in the real estate market, which could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell collateral upon any foreclosure; our inability to realize operating efficiencies and tax savings from the implementation of our strategic plan; governmental legislation and regulation, including changes in the nature and timing of the adoption and effectiveness of new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as amended, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as amended, Basel guidelines, capital requirements, accounting regulation or standards and other applicable laws and regulations ; the loss of large depositor relationships, which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources; operational and liquidity risks associated with our business, including liquidity risks inherent in correspondent banking ; volatility in interest rates and our overall management of interest rate risk, including managing the sensitivity of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to interest rates, and the impact to our earnings from a change in interest rates; the potential for our Bank’s regulatory lending limits and other factors related to our size to restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy; strategic acquisitions we may undertake to achieve our goals; the sufficiency of our capital, including sources of capital and the extent to which we may be required to raise additional capital to meet our goals; fluctuations in the fair value of our investment securities that are beyond our control; deterioration in th e fiscal position of the U.S. government and downgrades in Treasury and federal agency securities; potential exposure to fraud, negligence, computer theft and cyber-crime; the adequacy of our risk management framework;

our involvement from time to time in litigation or other proceedings instituted by or against shareholders, customers, emplo yees or third parties and the cost of legal fees associated with such litigation or proceedings; the susceptibility of our market to natural disasters and acts of God; and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to remediate any future material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Risk Factors” included in this Report. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Report, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict their occurrence or how they will affect us .

BUSINESS OVERVIEW CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc., a Tennessee corporation, is a bank holding company that is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee and that operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, a Tennessee-chartered state bank. CapStar Bank was incorporated in the State of Tennessee in 2007 and acquired a state charter in 2008 which was accomplished through a de novo application with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (“TDFI”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Upon approval of its charter, CapStar Bank opened for business to the public on July 14, 2008. CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in 2015 and, on February 5, 2016, completed a share exchange with CapStar Bank’s shareholders that resulted in CapStar Bank becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We are a bank that seeks to establish and maintain comprehensive relationships with our clients by delivering customized and creative banking solutions and superior client service. Our products and services include (i) commercial and industrial loans to small and medium sized businesses, (ii) commercial real estate loans, (iii) private banking and wealth management services for the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals; (iv) correspondent banking services to meet the needs of Tennessee’s smaller community banks and (v) various retail and consumer products. Our operations are presently concentrated in Tennessee. As of December 31, 2019, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $2.0 billion, total deposits of $1.7 billion, total net loans of $1.4 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $273 million. Core Operating Principles We operate our business in conformity with our core principles which are, in order of priority: • Soundness - We strive to engage in safe and sound banking practices that preserve the asset quality of our balance sheet and protect our deposit base and ensure we maintain capital levels that are considered above “well capitalized” according to regulatory standards. • Profitability - We seek to improve our core profitability metrics through optimal balance sheet management, economies of scale and expanded services. • Strategic Growth - we seek to grow our loans, deposits and net income by building long-term relationships with our customers based on top quality service and leveraging our operating platform to facilitate acquisitive growth. We have historically adhered to these core operating principles, and we intend to continue to emphasize the importance of these principles to the conduct of our business. Recent Acquisitions and Expansion On July 31, 2012, our bank completed its acquisition of American Security, a Tennessee banking corporation headquartered in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Our bank acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of American Security for approximately $15.2 million in total consideration which was comprised of the issuance of approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock of our bank. At the time of the acquisition, American Security had two banking locations located in Sumner County, Tennessee. The operations of American Security are included in CapStar Bank’s financial statements beginning on July 31, 2012. On February 3, 2014, CapStar Bank completed its acquisition of Farmington Financial Group, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Farmington primarily originates residential real estate loans that are sold in the secondary market. The bank acquired all the assets and liabilities of Farmington for approximately $6.4 million in total consideration which was comprised of $3.0 million in cash, 100,000 shares of common stock of our bank and a five year earn-out based on pre-tax income. The operations of Farmington are included in CapStar Bank’s financial statements beginning on February 3, 2014. 1 On October 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Athens Bancshares Corporation (“Athens”), the bank holding company for Athens Federal Community Bank, National Association (“Athens Federal”), headquartered in Athens, Tennessee. We acquired a ll of the outstanding shares of common stock of Athens for approximately $92.9 million in total consideration which was primarily comprised of the issuance of approximately 5.2 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of the acquisition, Athens Federal had eight banking locations located th roughout the Eastern Tennessee corridor between Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee. The operations of Athens are included in our financial statements beginning October 1, 2018. On January 23, 2020, we announced the signing of definitive merger agreements with FCB Corporation (“FCB”), its wholly owned subsidiary The First National Bank of Manchester (“FNBM”), and The Bank of Waynesboro (“BOW”) providing for FCB to merge with and into CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and for FNBM and BOW to merge with and into CapStar Bank. Under the terms of the merger agreements, FCB and BOW shareholders will receive 3,634,218 CapStar common shares and $26.4 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, totaling $85.1 million based on the closing price of CapStar’s common stock on January 22, 2020. Pending regulatory and shareholder approvals and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to be finalized in late second or early third quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2019, FCB and BOW had total combined assets of $467 million. Upon completion of the transaction, CapStar is expected to have total consolidated assets of approximately $2.5 billion. Our Products and Services Loans General. Through our bank, we offer a broad range of commercial lending products to small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals. Our strategy is to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio in terms of the type of loan product, the type of client and the industries in which our business clients are engaged. Our commercial and industrial lending products include commercial loans, business term loans, equipment financing and lines of credit to a diversified mix of small and medium sized businesses. We offer commercial real estate loans that are collateralized by both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties, as well as interim construction loans. Our consumer lending products include residential first mortgage loans which are typically thereafter sold on the secondary market. We offer second mortgage home equity mortgage loans and other consumer related loans such as loans for automobile or other recreational vehicles, which we maintain on the Bank’s balance sheet. Additionally, we offer lines of credit to facilitate investment opportunities for consumer clients whose financial characteristics support the request. We market our lending products and services to existing clients through our client service. We seek to attract new lending clients through customized and creative lending solutions and competitive pricing. We have banking teams that are specifically dedicated to the markets in which we serve. We believe our industry-specific knowledge, product and local market expertise and engagement increase our profile within these lending verticals, enable us to identify, select and compete for qualified borrowers and attractive financing projects and manage more effectively the potential risks of our loan portfolio. Underwriting. Disciplined underwriting is the foundation of our credit culture. We strive to adhere to thorough underwriting standards and deliver customized and creative loan solutions in a responsive and timely manner. Philosophically, we seek loans that are prudent and desirable, not just “doable.” In considering a loan, we follow the underwriting principles in our loan and credit administration policies which include the following requirements: • receipt of certain financial information, such as financial statements, tax returns and credit reports, to ensure that the potential borrower has sufficient recurring cash flow and liquidity to repay the loan; • determination that the structure of the loan matches the underlying purpose of and repayment source for the loan, the potential borrower’s creditworthiness and the depreciable life of any collateral; • verification that the potential borrower has a demonstrated propensity to repay the loan/the borrower’s indebtedness/etc.; 2 • consideration of the value, liquidity and marketability of the potential borrower’s assets and identifying and evaluating all significant direct and contingent liabilities; and • determination and approval of the rates and fees associated with the potential loan. Except in very limited circumstances in which substantial equity is present, our commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are supported by personal guaranties from the principals of the borrower. In addition, we require our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans to be secured by well- managed income producing property with adequate margins, supported by a history of profitable operations and cash flows, and proven operating stability. Our underwriting processes collaboratively engage our bankers, credit underwriters and portfolio managers in the analysis of each loan request. We manage our credit risks by analyzing metrics in order to maintain a conservative and well-diversified loan portfolio reflective of our assessment of various subsets within our market. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ tiered review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. Concentrations. We are a relationship-oriented, rather than a transaction-based, bank. Accordingly, substantially all of our loans have been made to borrowers located in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 94% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market, and a substantial portion of those loans are considered commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied and non-owner occupied real estate), mortgage loans and construction loans. As such, a substantial majority of our loan portfolio is dependent upon the economic environment of our Target Market. We do have a limited number of loans secured by properties located outside of Tennessee, most of which are made to borrowers who are well-known to us because they are headquartered or reside within Tennessee. In addition, we employ appropriate limits on our overall loan portfolio and requirements with respect to certain types of lending. As a general practice, we operate with an internal guideline limiting loans to any single borrowing relationship to a tiered amount based upon our internal risk rating. Many of our loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2019, our 25 largest borrowing relationships (which may include multiple loans to one borrower or loans to multiple entities that are affiliated due to common ownership) accounted for approximately 17% of our total loan portfolio. Credit Risk Management. Managing credit risk is a process that involves the entire Company. Our strategy for credit risk management includes the disciplined underwriting process described above, adherence to prudent standards, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all loan exposures. Our Chief Credit Officer provides bank-wide credit oversight and regularly reviews the loan portfolio to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. We periodically submit ourselves to review by independent third parties to validate our internal oversight. We strive to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans become delinquent or impaired, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Credit risk management involves a partnership between our lenders and our credit administration group with credit approval processes requiring concurrence of the two. The members of our credit administration group primarily focus their efforts on credit analysis, underwriting and monitoring new credits and providing management reporting to executive management and our board of directors. Based upon size, emerging problem loans are assigned to our Special Assets Group to mitigate the risk of loss. Executive management regularly reviews the status of the watch list and classified assets portfolio as well as the larger credits in the portfolio. Our Special Assets Group is also responsible for managing the collection and foreclosure process and the disposal of other real estate owned. Deposits Core deposits are our principal source of funds for use in lending and other general banking purposes. We solicit core deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through relationship-focused marketing. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, time and savings deposits, certificates of deposit and CDARS ® reciprocal products. Other than deposits obtained through the CDARS program, we do not rely on brokered deposits as a meaningful source of funding. 3 Our ability to gather deposits is an important aspect of our business franchise, and we believe this is a significant driver of our success. Our largest source of deposits is money market and savings accounts. Our transaction accounts include checki ng and NOW accounts, which provide us with a source of fee income, as well as a low-cost source of funds. Time accounts also provide us with a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. Certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 are held primaril y by clients in our Target Market . Deposit rates are reviewed regularly by senior management as we continuously seek to price our deposit products and services competitively to promote core deposit growth. Our management believes that the rates that we offer are competitive with those offered by other institutions in our Target Market. Correspondent Banking We provide correspondent banking services to community banks located in our market. Services we offer include settlement, Fed Funds lines of credit, depository products, wire transfer services, bank holding company loans and loan participations on larger commercial and commercial real estate exposures. Correspondent banking loans and deposits comprised approximately $24.2 million of our total loans and $312.8 million of our total deposits as of December 31, 2019. Loans made to community banks related to correspondent banking comprised 6% of commercial and industrial loans as of December 31, 2019. Deposits from community banks related to correspondent banking comprised 18% of total deposits as of December 31, 2019. Correspondent banking provides a valuable funding source for the bank. In 2013, management identified a void in the Tennessee correspondent banking market due to the instability of larger correspondent banks. Other factors leading to the expansion of correspondent banking included a need to diversify our funding base, the desire by many community banks to do business with a Tennessee-based correspondent bank, the ability to recruit well-known and respected talent for business development and risk management, and the ability to license a low cost proprietary settlement platform. Mortgage Banking Mortgage banking generated $548.1 million in mortgage loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Mortgage loans are typically sold in the secondary market and are underwritten by the bank. Mortgage banking has provided the bank a source of noninterest income and referrals for other banking services including home equity lines of credit and deposit products. Other Services Given client demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour telephone and online banking, direct deposit, mobile banking, safe deposit boxes, remote deposit and cash management services for individuals and small and medium sized business. We also participate in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers are able to use throughout Tennessee and other regions. In many cases, we reimburse our customer for any ATM fees that may be charged to the customer. Competition The financial services industry is highly competitive in our Target Market. In particular, the Target Market consisted of 65 financial institutions with over $64 billion in deposits as of June 30, 2019. We held the number 11 deposit market share position at June 30, 2019 with 2.1% of the deposit market share. We compete for loans, deposits, and financial services in our Target Market. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area, Internet-based banks, out-of-market banks, and bank holding companies that advertise in or otherwise serve our market area, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. We believe that our experienced leadership, efficient and scalable operating model, personalized service and emphasis on attracting core deposits from our other product offerings enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which we operate. 4 Information and Technology We continually adapt to the changing technological needs and wants of our clients by investing in our electronic banking platform. We use a combination of online and mobile banking channels to attract and retain clients and expand the convenience of banking with us. In most cases, our clients can initiate banking transactions from the convenience of their personal computer or smart phone, reducing the number of in-branch visits necessary to conduct routine banking transactions. The remote transactions available to our clients include remote image deposit, bill payment, external and internal transfers, ACH origination and wire transfer. We believe that our investments in technology and innovation are consistent with our clients’ needs and will support future migration of our clients’ transactions to these and other developing electronic banking channels. Further, we closely monitor information security for trends and new threats, including cybersecurity risks, and invest significant resources to continuously improve the security and privacy of our systems and data. For more information, please see “– Supervision and Regulation - Cybersecurity and Privacy”. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we had 289 total employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance and that of our subsidiaries may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the TDFI, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitizations and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results and those of our bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of insured banks, their holding companies and affiliates that are intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and enter into acquisitions with other companies, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective primary federal regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and our bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. 5 Bank Holding Company Regulation Since we own all of the capital stock of our bank, we are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Acquisition of Banks The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before: • acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will, directly or indirectly, own or control 5% or more of the bank’s voting shares; • acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or • merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of the above transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources includes a focus on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section titled “Item 1. Business—Regulation and Supervision—Capital Adequacy.” The Federal Reserve also considers the effectiveness of the institutions in combating money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering program of the acquiring bank holding company and the anti-money laundering compliance records of a bank to be acquired as part of the transaction. Finally, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration the extent to which the proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Under the BHC Act, if well-capitalized and well-managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. In each case, however, state law may place restrictions on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for at least three years. Change in Bank Control Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute acquisition of “control” of the bank holding company if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the transaction or the bank holding company has registered securities under the Exchange Act. In addition, any person or group of persons acting in concert must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25% (or 5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, the right to control in any manner the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the bank holding company. Permitted Activities Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities: • banking or managing or controlling banks; and • any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 6 Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include: • factoring accounts receivable; • making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities in connection with the foregoing; • leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; • operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; • engaging in trust company functions in a manner authorized by state law; • financial and investment advisory activities; • discount securities brokerage activities; • underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; • providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; • performing selected data processing services and support services; • acting as an agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and • performing selected insurance underwriting activities. The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. Support of Subsidiary Institutions The Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. As a result of a bank holding company’s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank. Repurchase or Redemption of Securities A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions. Bank Regulation and Supervision Our bank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of the operations of our bank. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the safety and soundness of our bank and our bank’s depositors, rather than our shareholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to our bank. 7 Since our bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the state of Tennessee and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. Th e Federal Reserve and the TDFI regularly examine our bank’s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Our bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. Our bank is also subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations. Branching Under current Tennessee law, our bank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of, or prior notice to, the TDFI and the Federal Reserve. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, our bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Tennessee. Under federal law, our bank may establish branch offices with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. While prior law imposed various limits on the ability of banks to establish new branches in states other than their home state, the Dodd-Frank Act allows a bank to branch into a new state by setting up a new branch if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. This makes it much simpler for banks to open de novo branches in other states. FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the assessment rate is determined by the risk category assigned to an institution based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations which are designed to measure risk, with riskier institutions paying a higher assessment rate. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC. In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions were required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a federal government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The final FICO assessment collection occurred in March 2019. Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our bank’s record of performance under the CRA is publicly available. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. As of December 31, 2019 the Bank had a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” Interest Rate Limitations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by our bank are subject to applicable state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. 8 Federal Laws Applicable t o Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions Our bank’s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including: • the Federal Truth in Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; • the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves; • the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or certain other prohibited factors in all aspects of credit transactions; • the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; • the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by debt collectors; • the Service Members Civil Relief Act, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in military service; • the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, governing the disclosure and safeguarding of sensitive non-public personal information of our clients; • the Right to Financial Privacy Act, imposing a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; • the Electronic Funds Transfer Act governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and clients’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and • the rules and regulations of the CFPB and various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. Capital Adequacy Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, under the adopted regulations, the Basel member central bank and federal bank regulators approved the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord, or Basel III. The U.S. Basel III rule’s minimum capital to risk-weighted assets, or RWA, requirements are as follows: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The rule also changed the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Basel III rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital. Under the U.S. Basel III rule, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016, and the requirements became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization maintaining capital levels in excess of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. A banking organization also would be prohibited from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework requires us to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios of (i) 7% for common equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5% total capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. With the capital conservation buffer fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action, or PCA, well-capitalized thresholds. 9 Generally, banking organizations of our size became subject to the U.S. Basel III rule on January 1, 2015, while the capital conservation buffer and the deductions from common equity Ti er 1 capital phase d in over time. Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a banking institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal re gulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into which all insured depository institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds and other qualitative requirements for each of those categories. For an insured depository institution to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2019, our bank qualified for the “well capitalized” category. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new markets or product offerings, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with Federal Reserve approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. Liquidity Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. This scrutiny has increased during recent years, as the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s negatively affected the liquidity of many financial institutions. Various bank regulatory publications, including Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management) and FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-84-2008 (Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions. Any increased liquidity requirements applied to us or our bank generally would be expected to cause us or our bank to invest assets more conservatively—and therefore at lower yields—than we and our bank otherwise might invest. Such lower-yield investments likely would reduce our revenue stream, and in turn our earnings potential. 10 Payment of Dividends We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, is dividends our bank pays to us as our bank’s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to our bank’s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our shareholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Tennessee corporate law which prevents payment of dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our board of directors must consider our and our bank’s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs. The TDFI also regulates our bank’s dividend payments. Under Tennessee law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend without prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (i) the total of its retained net income for that year, plus (ii) its retained net income for the preceding two years. Our bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Our bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of the bank’s transactions with its affiliates. Subject to various exceptions, the total amount of the bank’s transactions with affiliates is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, transactions with affiliates also must meet specified collateral requirements and safety and soundness requirements. Our bank must also comply with provisions prohibiting the acquisition of low-quality assets from an affiliate. Our bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in transactions with affiliates, as well as other types of transactions set forth in Section 23B, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Our bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions between the bank and third parties, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There are also individual and aggregate limitations on loans to insiders and their related interests. The aggregate amount of insider loans generally cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus. Insiders and banks are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly entering into insider loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Single Borrower Credit Limits Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. 11 Commercial Real Estate Concentration In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.” Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2019, our bank’s total CRE loans represented 297% of its capital. Privacy Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting non-public personal information of their clients. Clients generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing non-public personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. Consumer Credit Reporting The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) imposes, among other things: • requirements for financial institutions to develop policies and procedures to identify potential identity theft and, upon the request of a consumer, to place a fraud alert in the consumer’s credit file stating that the consumer may be the victim of identity theft or other fraud; • requirements for entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies to implement procedures and policies regarding the accuracy and integrity of the furnished information and regarding the correction of previously furnished information that is later determined to be inaccurate; • requirements for mortgage lenders to disclose credit scores to consumers in certain circumstances; and • limitations on the ability of a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate to use that information for marketing purposes. Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation Our bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank has established an anti-money laundering program pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act and customer identification program pursuant to the USA Patriot Act. The bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. Our bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements. Overdraft Fees Federal Reserve Regulation E restricts banks’ abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. 12 The Dodd-Frank Act As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this new law has significantly changed and is significantly changing the bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on the rules and regulations that implement it. A number of the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this “Supervision and Regulation” section. The following items provide a brief description of certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and our bank. • The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to enumerated consumer financial protection laws over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer financial protection laws by their primary federal regulator. • The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. The law created a variety of new consumer protections, including limitations, subject to exceptions, on the manner by which loan originators may be compensated and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower’s “ability to repay” a residential mortgage loan. Final rules implementing these latter statutory requirements became effective in 2014. • The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. • The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (i) requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments; (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (iii) requires national securities exchanges to require listed companies to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers; (iv) authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials; and (v) directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, we expect compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, on February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for his administration to review existing U.S. financial laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act. At this time, it is unclear if this executive order will result in any material changes to current laws and regulations applicable to us. The Volcker Rule On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted a final rule implementing the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits any “banking entity” from engaging in proprietary trading or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with covered funds (i.e., hedge funds or private equity funds). In addition, the Volcker Rule requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule. 13 On October 8, 2019, the agencies finalized revisions to the Volcker Rule that, among other things, simplif ied and streamlined compliance requirements for banking entities that do not have significant trading activities, while banking entities with significant trading activity would become subject to more stringent compliance requirements. Further, the revisio ns to the Volcker Rule implemented Section 203 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which amended the definition of “banking entity” to exclude certain community banks from the definition of insured depository i nstitution, the general result of which was to exclude such banks and their affiliates and subsidiaries from the scope of the Volcker Rule. Under EGRRCPA, a community bank and its affiliates are generally excluded from the definition of “banking entity” i f the bank and all companies that control the bank have total consolidated assets equal to $10 billion or less and trading assets and liabilities equal to five percent or less of total consolidated assets. These revisions became effective on January 1, 20 20, with a required compliance date of January 1, 2021. Limitations on Incentive Compensation In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and our bank, the proposal imposes principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions are prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal also imposes certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. The Federal Reserve reserves the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. We do not expect this proposal to significantly impact our business. Cybersecurity and Privacy Cybersecurity is a high-priority item for legislators and regulators at the federal and state levels, as well as internationally. State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements and, in some cases, regulations, emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision. Such policy statements and regulations indicate that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. These requirements, including state regulatory rules such as the detailed and extensive cybersecurity rules issued in 2016 by the New York State Department of Financial Services, may cause us to incur significant additional compliance costs and in some cases may impact our growth prospects. Additionally, if we fail to observe federal or state regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We also employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, as attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume and complexity, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Financial expenditures may also be required to meet regulatory changes in the information security and cybersecurity domains. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See “Item 1A. – Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity. 14 Federal statutes and regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, limit our ability to disclose non-public information about consumers, customers and employees to nonaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the GLBA requires us to disclose our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing non-public information and enable s retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. The GLBA also requires us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and p hysical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and, if applicable state law is more protective of customer privacy than the GLBA, financial institutions, including our bank, will be required to comply with such state law. Other laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information securit y standards and programs to protect such information. Proposed or new legislation and regulations may also significantly increase our compliance cost and impede our ability to grow into specific markets. There are a number of proposals that have either recently been adopted or are currently pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. In addition, California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) on June 28, 2018. Both the GDPR and the CCPA impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. In the event of a data breach, there are mandatory reporting requirements that may hamper the ability to fully assess an incident prior to external reporting. We must maintain awareness of additional legal and regulatory requirements that apply to existing and future subsets of the customer base for protection against legal, reputational, and financial risk due to compliance failures. U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) was enacted into law. The Tax Reform Act provides for significant changes to the U.S. tax code that impact businesses. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Reform Act reduced the U.S. federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% for U.S. taxable income and required a one-time remeasurement of deferred taxes to reflect their value at a lower tax rate of 21%. The Tax Reform Act included other changes, including, but not limited to, a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses, elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, additional limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we recorded a $3.56 million increase in income tax expense for 2017.

RI SK FACTORS We are subject to numerous risks, and the material risks that management believe affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations are described below. Many of these risks are beyond our control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing financial and operational results. You should carefully read and consider the following risks factors. The occurrence of any of the following risks, as well as risks of which we are currently unaware or currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. As a result, the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the following risks and other information in this Report or incorporated into this Report by reference, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” should be carefully considered before investing in shares of our common stock. Some statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Report. Risks Related To Our Business As a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions. Our business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic and other conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder United States economic growth. As an example, the recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China may result in the extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. Depending on future developments (including the extent of the virus’s spread and the measures, such as quarantines and travel restrictions, taken to contain such spread), the outbreak may adversely affect economic conditions in the United States generally and our markets in particular. Weak economic conditions are characterized by numerous factors; such as deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. The current economic environment is also characterized by interest rates at near historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our loan and investment portfolios. All of these factors can individually or in the aggregate be detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our business and operations are concentrated in our Target Market, and we are more sensitive than our more geographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy. Unlike with many of our larger competitors that maintain significant operations located outside our market area, substantially all of our clients are individuals and businesses located and doing business in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 94% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market. Therefore, our success will depend upon the general economic conditions in this area, which we cannot predict with certainty. As a result, our operations and profitability may be more adversely affected by a local economic downturn in our Target Market than those of larger, more geographically diverse competitors. For example, the Nashville, Tennessee economy is particularly sensitive to changes in the healthcare service, music and entertainment and hospitality and tourism industries, among others. A downturn in these industries or in the local economy generally could make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay their loans and may lead to loan losses that are not offset by operations in other markets; it may also reduce the ability of depositors to make or maintain deposits with us. For these reasons, any regional or local economic downturn that affects our Target market, or existing or prospective borrowers or depositors in our Target Market could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 16 From time to time, our bank may provide financing to clients who own or have companies or properties located outside our Target Market . In such cases, we would face similar local market risk in those communities for these clients. Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability. The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, internet banks, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our service area. These competitors often have far greater resources than we do and are able to conduct more intensive and broader-based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and individual clients. Our competitors may be able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we choose or have the capability to offer. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. We compete with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we must attract our client base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with an array of financial institutions in our service area. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things: • our ability to recruit and retain experienced and talented bankers at competitive compensation levels; • our ability to build and maintain long-term client relationships while ensuring high ethical standards and safe and sound banking practices; • the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services that we offer; • client satisfaction with our products and services; • industry and general economic trends; and • our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates that we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. We derive a substantial majority of our business from our Target Market, which is a highly competitive banking market. Our failure to compete effectively in our market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are dependent on the services of our management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key personnel or directors may adversely affect our business and operations. We are led by an experienced core management team with substantial experience in the markets that we serve, and our operating strategy focuses on providing products and services through long-term relationship managers and ensuring that our largest clients have relationships with our senior management team. Accordingly, our success depends in large part on the performance of these key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. If any of our executive officers, other key personnel, or directors leaves us or our bank, our operations may be adversely affected. While we have employment agreements containing non-competition provisions with many of our key personnel, if any of such personnel leaves his or her position for any reason, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified personnel to replace them. Additionally, our directors’ community involvement and diverse and extensive local business relationships are important to our success. 17 Our business strategy includes the continuation of our growth plans, and we could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We intend to continue pursuing our growth strategy for our business through organic growth of our loan and deposit portfolio as well as through strategic acquisitions. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties that can be encountered by financial service companies in rapid growth stages, which include the risks associated with the following: • maintaining loan quality; • maintaining adequate management personnel and information systems to oversee such growth; • maintaining adequate control and compliance functions; • obtaining regulatory approvals with respect to acquisitions; • entry into new markets, industries, and product areas; and • the costs associated with identifying and pursuing strategic transactions; and • securing capital and liquidity needed to support anticipated growth. We may not be able to expand our presence in our existing market or new markets. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas, the availability of capital to fund growth opportunities and our ability to manage our growth. Failure to manage our growth effectively could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. As a bank that focuses on building comprehensive banking relationships with clients, our reputation is critical to our business, and damage to it could have a material adverse effect on us. A key differentiating factor for our business is the strong brand we are building in our Target Market. Through our branding, we communicate to the market about our company and the products and services we offer. Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining clients and employees. Adverse perceptions of us could make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including actual or perceived employee misconduct, misconduct by our outsourced service providers or other counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, our failure to meet our standards of service and quality and compliance failures. Negative publicity regarding us or our bank, whether or not accurate, may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients, who may have greater credit risk than larger borrowers. We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive, economic or financial pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. Our concentration of large loans to a limited number of borrowers may increase our credit risk. Our growth over the last several years has been partially attributable to our ability to originate and retain large loans. In addition to regulatory limits to which our bank is subject, we have established an internal policy limiting loans to one borrower, principal or guarantor based on “total exposure,” which represents the aggregate exposure of economically related borrowers for approval purposes; loans in excess of our internal limit require acknowledgment by our bank’s full board of directors. Many of these loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2019, our 25 largest borrowing relationships accounted for approximately 17% of our total loan portfolio. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, this high concentration of borrowers presents a risk to our lending operations. If any one of these borrowers becomes unable to repay its loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce or death, our non-accrual loans and our allowance for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. To mitigate this risk, we establish internal lending limits tied to the borrower’s risk profile, seek collateral, and involve increasing levels of senior management and board involvement in the approval of large loan relationships. 18 Lack of seasoning of our loan portfolio could incre ase risk of credit defaults in the future. As a result of our growth over the past several years, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 54% of our loan portfolio had been originated since December 31, 2017, including new originations and renewals. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as “seasoning.” As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Because a large portion of our portfolio is relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level of delinquencies and defaults that could occur as the portfolio becomes more seasoned and may not serve as a reliable basis for predicting the health and nature of our loan portfolio. Our limited experience with these loans does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of our loan portfolio. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We may not be able to adequately assess and limit our credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability. A primary component of our business involves making loans to clients. The business of lending is inherently risky because the principal of or interest on the loan may not be repaid timely or at all or the value of any collateral supporting the loan may be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower’s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring our loan applicants and the concentration of our loans and our credit approval practices, may not adequately assess credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively assess and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Repayment of our leveraged loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our leveraged loans are primarily commercial in nature. Frequently, these loans have a secondary source of repayment that is directly correlated with the primary source of repayment. Leveraged borrowers may have a diminished ability to adjust to unexpected events and changes in business conditions because of a higher ratio of liabilities to capital, and in some cases, reliance is placed on enterprise value as a secondary source of repayment. The repayment of leveraged loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and on enterprise value as a secondary source of repayment. To mitigate this risk, we give enhanced scrutiny to leveraged loan transactions, assess risk probabilities using benchmarks obtained from external rating agencies, and engage higher levels of senior management and board involvement in the approval and ongoing review of leveraged loan relationships. Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management’s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of concentrations, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes in a relatively short time period. Inaccurate management assumptions, continuing deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan portfolio and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and may require adjustments based upon judgments that are different than those of management. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, we may need to increase our provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for such losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 19 The healthcare service industry is an integral component of the local economy, and adverse trends in the h ealthcare service industry could have a material adverse effect on us. The healthcare service industry is an integral segment of the local economy. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 9% of our loan portfolio was composed of loans to borrowers in the healthcare service industry. Adverse trends in the healthcare service industry may have a negative impact on a significant portion of the Company’s borrowers and clients. The healthcare service industry may be affected by the following: • trends in the method of delivery of healthcare services; • competition among healthcare providers; • consolidation of large health insurers; • lower reimbursement rates from government and commercial payors, high uncompensated care expense, investment losses and limited admissions growth pressuring operating profit margins for healthcare providers; • availability of capital; • credit downgrades; • liability insurance expense; • regulatory and government reimbursement uncertainty resulting from changes to laws governing the delivery of healthcare services and reimbursement of providers of healthcare services; • congressional efforts to repeal and federal court cases challenging the legality of certain aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; • health reform initiatives to address healthcare costs through expanded value-based purchasing programs, bundled provider payments, health insurance exchanges, increased patient cost-sharing, geographic payment variations, comparative effectiveness research, lower payments for hospital readmissions, and shared risk-and-reward payment models such as accountable care organizations; • federal and state government plans to reduce budget deficits and address debt ceiling limits by lowering healthcare provider Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, while requiring increased patient access to care; • equalizing Medicare payment rates across different facility-type settings; • heightened health information technology security standards and the meaningful use of electronic health records by healthcare providers; and • Pandemics which could result in the extended shutdown or restriction of certain healthcare related businesses and services; • potential tax law changes affecting healthcare providers. These changes, among others, could adversely affect the economic performance of some or all of our borrowers and clients in the healthcare services industry and, in turn, have a materially negative impact on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans. Our loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, or CRE loans, to individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as construction and land development loans. CRE loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Weak economic conditions or other market factors can result in increased vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial property. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate under adverse conditions. Additionally, non-owner-occupied CRE loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner-occupied CRE loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We mitigate these risks both in our selection criteria for borrowers and project sponsors and in our general practice of requiring cash equity contributions substantially in excess of Supervisory Loan to Value limits as set forth in Appendix A of Part 365 – Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies. 20 A prolonged downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and adversely affect our profitability. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 27% of our loan portfolio was composed of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 12% of owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 18% consumer real estate loans, and 10% construction and land development loans. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A decline in real estate values could further impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amounts we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. If we are required to re-value the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Regulatory requirements affecting our loans secured by commercial real estate could limit our ability to leverage our capital and adversely affect our growth and profitability. The federal banking agencies have indicated their view that banks with high concentrations of loans secured by commercial real estate are subject to increased risk and should implement robust risk management policies and maintain higher capital than regulatory minimums to maintain an appropriate cushion against loss that is commensurate with the perceived risk. Guidance from the Federal banking agencies identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk as those that have (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land loans representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital if the outstanding balance of the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on commercial real estate, a change in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us or a decline in our regulatory capital could limit our ability to leverage our capital as a result of these policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral and own the underlying real estate, subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property. Since we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: • general or local economic conditions; • environmental cleanup liability; • neighborhood assessments; • interest rates; • real estate tax rates; • operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; • supply of and demand for rental units or properties; • ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; • zoning laws; • governmental and regulatory rules; • fiscal policies; and • natural disasters. 21 Our inability to manage the amount of costs or size of the risks associated with the ownership of real estate, or write-downs in the value of other real estate owned, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospec ts and results of operations. We have several large depositor relationships, the loss of which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources. As of December 31, 2019, our ten largest non-brokered depositors accounted for approximately 13% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. We may also be forced, as a result of any withdrawal of deposits, to rely more heavily on other, potentially more expensive and less stable funding sources. Consequently, the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Correspondent banking introduces unique risks, which could affect our liquidity. Although correspondent banking provides diversification of our funding base, it introduces a unique set of risks. Increases in the federal funds rate could create liquidity issues within the bank as it competes with the interest on reserves rate paid by the Federal Reserve Bank. Additionally, strong industry-wide loan demand could also create liquidity issues as excess balances held at CapStar Bank by our correspondent banks would presumably be redeployed by those banks into new loans. Further, capital inadequacy or asset quality issues at other institutions could result in increased risk to us due to the potential for large deposit withdrawals. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and our funding sources may be insufficient to fund our future growth. Liquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. An inability to raise funds, at competitive rates or at all, through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. In particular, approximately 82% of our bank’s deposits as of December 31, 2019 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice, while by comparison, 70% of the assets of our bank were loans at December 31, 2019, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. For example, we rely on deposits, federal funds purchased and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (“FHLB”) to fund our operations. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions were to change. In such a circumstance, we may seek additional borrowings to achieve our long-term business objectives; however, they may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, whole loan sale agreements may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach representations or warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including government-sponsored entities, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet deposit withdrawals and other client needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our asset growth, new business transactions, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 22 We are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our profit s . Our profits, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our interest rate sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2019, meaning that our net interest income would increase more from rising interest rates than from falling interest rates. However, many assumptions are used to model the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income. Due to the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions, our models may not be an accurate indicator of how our interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Changes in monetary policy and government responses to adverse economic conditions such as inflation and deflation may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve, could lead to inflation, deflation, or other economic phenomena that could adversely affect our financial performance. The primary impact of inflation on our operations most likely will be reflected in increased operating costs. Conversely, deflation generally will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality. Our bank’s size presents multiple challenges that may restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy, such as our regulatory and internal lending limits and our ability to effectively leverage our infrastructure to implement our business strategy. We are limited in the amount our bank can loan in the aggregate to a single borrower or related borrowers by the amount of the bank’s capital. CapStar Bank is a Tennessee-chartered bank and therefore is subject to the legal lending limits of the state of Tennessee and federal law. Tennessee and federal legal lending limits are safety and soundness measures intended to prevent one person or a relatively small and economically related group of persons from borrowing an unduly large amount of a bank’s funds. They are also intended to safeguard a bank’s depositors by diversifying the risk of loan losses among a relatively large number of credit-worthy borrowers engaged in various types of businesses. Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower generally may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. We have also established an internal limit on loans to one borrower to be between 7% and 15% of our risked based capital, depending upon the underlying risk rating of the borrower. Loans in excess of our internal limit are noted as a policy exception and require acknowledgment by our bank’s full board of directors. Based upon our bank’s current capital levels, the amount it may lend is significantly less than that of many of our larger competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of the bank’s lending limit from doing business with us. Our bank accommodates larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available. If we are unable to compete effectively for loans from our target clients, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 23 Our growth strategy involve s strategic acquisitions, and we may not be able to overcome risks associated with such t ransactions. We plan to continue to explore opportunities to acquire other financial institutions and businesses in or around our existing Target Market or in comparable markets or that would provide scale, low cost of funds, non-interest income or products that are additive to our existing products and services. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the following: • the need to raise new capital; • the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our management’s attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business; • the lack of history among our management team in working together on acquisitions and related integration activities; • the time, expense, difficulty, and uncertainty of integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses; • an inability to realize expected synergies or returns on investment; • failure to discover the existence of liabilities during the due diligence process; • exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may not be indemnified; • potential disruption of our ongoing banking business; and • a loss of key employees or key clients following an acquisition. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying prospective transactions, making it difficult to implement our growth strategy. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future to fund such growth, and the unavailability of additional capital on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect us or our growth. We believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our capital needs for our immediate growth plans. However, we will continue to need capital to support our longer-term growth plans. If capital is not available on favorable terms when we need it, we may have to either issue common stock or other securities on less than desirable terms or reduce our rate of growth until market conditions become more favorable. Either of such events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The fair value of our investment securities could fluctuate because of factors outside of our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Factors beyond our control could significantly affect the fair value of our investment securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments, or OTTI, and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in earnings and/or other comprehensive income (loss), which could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is OTTI usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer, any collateral underlying the security as well as the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Our failure to assess any impairments or losses with respect to our securities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 24 Deterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and federal agency s ecurities could adversely affect us and our banking operations. The long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government is uncertain, as illustrated by the 2011 downgrade by certain rating agencies of the credit rating of the U.S. government and federal agencies. However, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any future downgrade, failure to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the U.S. federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. In particular, such events could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect our profitability. Also, the adverse consequences of any downgrade could extend to those to whom we extend credit and could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, other third parties, and our employees. When we originate loans, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal, title information and employment and income documentation. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the fair value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, the borrower, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. The persons and entities involved in such a misrepresentation are often difficult to locate, and we are often unable to collect any monetary losses that we have suffered from them. We may bear costs associated with the proliferation of computer theft and cyber-crime. We necessarily collect, use and hold sensitive data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with client expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. Although we actively invest in the security of our technological infrastructure, it is not feasible to defend against every risk posed by rapid technological development and the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our information technology department and third-party vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our employees or other internal sources, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our client accounts may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from network failures, viruses and malware, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters and catastrophic events. A breach of our security or the security of our third-party vendors that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, client notification requirements, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage, any of which could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 25 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us. Our risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, liquidity, capital, financial performance, asset/liability, operational, compliance and regulatory, Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, strategic and reputational, information technology and legal. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances, including if our management fails to follow our credit policies and procedures, and thus, it may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. We depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption in the operation of these systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of clients, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data. We rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio accounting. For example, one vendor provides our core banking system through a service bureau arrangement. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of client data. We may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. We may need to switch third-party service providers from time-to-time, which could result in disruption to our business processes, damage to our reputation and a breach of our data security measures. Such a disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. We encounter technological change continually and have fewer resources than certain of our competitors to invest in technological improvements. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to serving clients better, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our success will depend in part on our ability to address our clients’ needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than us, and in the future, we may not be able to implement new technology-driven products and services timely, effectively or at all or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may, in order to remain competitive, be required to make significant capital expenditures, which may increase our overall expenses and have a material adverse effect on our net income. There is also no guarantee that any such investment in these products and services will create additional efficiencies in our operations. 26 We may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems in the past and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities. In the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk. We use interest rate swaps to help manage our interest rate risk from recorded financial assets and liabilities when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and the asset or liability exposes us to interest rate risk or risks inherent in client related derivatives. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and routine monitoring, and is not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. We also have derivatives that result from a service we provide to certain qualifying clients approved through our credit process, and therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rates change in ways that are significantly different from what we expected when we entered into the derivative transaction. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of lawsuits and related legal proceedings, governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm. 27 Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is p robable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we may not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings or government or other inquiries. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly materially so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Target Market is susceptible to floods, tornados and other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God, which may adversely affect our business and operations. Substantially all of our business and operations are located in our Target Market, which is an area that has recently been damaged by floods and tornadoes and that is susceptible to other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God. Natural disasters, adverse weather events and acts of God can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. Any economic decline as a result of natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God can reduce the demand for loans and our other client solutions as well as client ability to repay such loans. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on loan portfolios may increase substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God. Therefore, natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God could result in decreased revenue and loan losses that have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation. We are not currently required to comply with SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are, therefore, not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose. We will be required to comply with these rules upon ceasing to be an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. When evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Further, the cost of any such compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be substantial and have a material effect on our cash flows and earnings. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing, and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and hiring additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows. 28 Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the Ta x Reform Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The Tax Reform Act significantly changes how corporations in the United States are taxed. The Tax Reform Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produ ced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As a result, we have recorded a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Reform Act on our deferred tax assets in our financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the Tax Reform Act, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The impact of the Tax Reform Act on our shareholders is uncertain and could be adverse. This Report does not discuss the manner in which the Tax Reform Act might affect our shareholders. Accordingly, we encourage our shareholders to consult with their own legal and tax advisors with respect to the Tax Reform Act and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock. We May Be Adversely Impacted By The Transition From LIBOR As A Reference Rate. In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. In particular, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. We have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 29 Changes in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our Company’s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations . There have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export, including among others, agricultural products, could cause the prices of our customers’ products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt; which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. On October 1, 2018, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to a new trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was ratified by Mexico and the United States but remains subject to ratification by the Canadian parliament, which may or may not occur by the end of 2020. The full impact of this agreement on us, our customers and on the economic conditions in our markets is currently unknown. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our customers' costs, demand for our customers' products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position that could materially adversely affect our performance. Risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position could materially adversely affect our performance. Home equity products, particularly those where we are in a second lien position, and particularly those in certain geographic areas, may carry a higher risk of non-collection than other loans. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. Of our $ 121.1 million home equity portfolio at December 31, 2019, approximately $ 117.4 million were home equity lines of credit and $ 3.7 million were closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $ 68.8 million of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position. Risks Related to Our Industry We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our business activities and impose financial requirements, such as minimum capital requirements, and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies including the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. Regulatory compliance is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, transactions with affiliates, treatment of our clients, and interest rates paid on deposits. We are also subject to financial requirements prescribed by our regulators such as minimum capitalization guidelines, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. Violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank acquisitions and other activities. Recently, banks generally have faced increased regulatory sanctions and scrutiny particularly with respect to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, or USA Patriot Act, and other statutes relating to anti-money laundering compliance and client privacy. Recent legislation has substantially changed, and increased, federal regulation of financial institutions, and there may be significant future legislation (and regulations under existing legislation) that could have a further material effect on bank holding companies like us and banks like CapStar Bank. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. 30 Federal and state regulators periodically examine our business and may require us to remediate adverse examination findings or may take enforcement action against us. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, the Federal Reserve or the TDFI were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to require us to remediate any such adverse examination findings. In addition, these agencies have the power to take enforcement action against us to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation of law or regulation or unsafe or unsound practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, to limit dividends and distributions, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory enforcement action against us could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to numerous fair lending laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. The CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking agencies, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on product offerings. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial service providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service, or IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the requirement to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Financial reform legislation has, among other things, tightened capital standards, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and resulted in new regulations that are likely to increase our costs of operations. As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act depends on the rules and regulations that implement it. 31 Among many other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competit ive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress. Under federal law and long-standing Federal Reserve policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our bank, and to commit resources to support our bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our shareholders’ or creditors,’ best interests to do so. A requirement to provide such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of repayment to deposit liabilities of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment over general unsecured creditor claims. Our FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase. The deposits of our bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments as determined according to the calculation described in “Supervision and Regulation—Bank Regulation and Supervision—FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments.” High levels of bank failures since the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund following the financial crisis, the FDIC increased deposit insurance assessment rates and charged special assessments to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Even though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange. The trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. Because of this, it may be more difficult for stockholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which stockholders could sell a smaller number of shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock. 32 The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future cou ld adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. A future issuance or future issuances of stock could dilute the value of our common stock. Our charter permits us to issue up to an aggregate of 25 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2019, 18,361,922 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, including 84,697 shares of restricted common stock that have yet to vest. Those shares outstanding do not include the potential issuance, as of December 31, 2019, of 271,202 shares of our common stock subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options under the Stock Incentive Plan, and 362,757 additional shares of our common stock that were reserved for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan. A future issuance of any new shares of our common stock would, and equity-related securities could, cause further dilution in the value of our outstanding shares of common stock. Significant sales of our common stock by certain shareholders could affect the market value of our common stock. On December 21, 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf Registrations Statement”) with the SEC on Form S-3 registering 3,652,094 shares of our common stock held by certain of our long-time shareholders, representing about 20.7% of our total issued and outstanding common stock. The Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 28, 2019. Accordingly, these shares represent a significant number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and, if sold in the market all at once or at about the same time, could depress the market price of our common stock and could further affect our ability to raise equity capital. Further, we cannot predict the size or the effect, if any, that sales of these shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may have on the market price of our shares of common stock or our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Any significant sales of these shares could have a materially adverse impact on our affairs, assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, short- and long-term performance goals, prospects and results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in our bank, to secure that debt. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, interest must be paid to a lender before dividends can be paid to our shareholders, and, in the case of liquidation, our borrowings must be repaid before we can distribute any assets to our shareholders. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if our bank were profitable. The rights of our common shareholders would likely be subordinate to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue an aggregate of up to five million shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. Accordingly, you should assume that any shares of preferred stock that we may issue in the future will also be senior to our common stock. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. We and our bank are subject to capital and other legal and regulatory requirements which restrict our ability to pay dividends. We are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. In addition, because our bank is our only material asset, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on our receipt of dividends from the bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. 33 We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to inv estors. We are an “emerging growth company,” as described in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These include, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial reporting requirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, a potential exemption from new auditing standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years, unless we earlier cease to be an emerging growth company, which would occur if our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these reduced regulatory and reporting requirements, which may result in a less active trading market and increased volatility in our stock price. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our headquarters and main branch office is located at 1201 Demonbreun Street, Suite 700, Nashville, Tennessee 37203. The following table summarizes pertinent details of our retail bank branch locations and mortgage origination offices as of March 6, 2020.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS General From time to time, the Company is party to legal actions that are routine and incidental to its business. Given the nature, scope and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to the Company’s business, including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, the Company, like all banking organizations, is subject to heightened legal and regulatory compliance and litigation risk. However, based upon available information and in consultation with legal counsel, management does not expect the ultimate disposition of any or a combination of these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects, results of operations, or trading price of its common stock. Litigation Against Gaylon M. Lawrence & The Lawrence Group On October 31, 2017, CapStar filed a complaint, captioned CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. v. Gaylon M. Lawrence & The Lawrence Group , Case No. 3:17-cv-01421, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, in connection with Mr. Lawrence and The Lawrence Group's acquisition of our common stock. The complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act by filing materially false and misleading Schedules 13D regarding defendants' acquisition of a minority stake (1,156,675 shares) of our common stock. It also alleged that defendants violated the Change in Bank Control Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1817(j) (the ""CBCA""), by attempting to acquire control of CapStar without first receiving approval from the Federal Reserve, and also that defendants violated Tennessee Code Section 45-2-107 by controlling banks without having registered as a bank holding company. By order dated December 18, 2017, the court granted our motion for expedited discovery, which is presently underway. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the action as well as a separate motion to stay. The motion to stay was denied by the court on May 21, 2018. On September 24, 2018, the court denied in part and granted in part defendants' motion to dismiss, permitting our claims that defendants violated Tennessee Code Section 45-2-107 under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act to proceed. Mr. Lawrence also filed an Interagency Notice of Change in Control pursuant to the CBCA with the Federal Reserve on October 30, 2017 ( the “Notice”), seeking permission to acquire up to 15% of the outstanding voting shares of our common stock. At the Federal Reserve's direction, on March 13, 2018, Mr. Lawrence requested that the Federal Reserve suspend processing of this Notice. On November 6, 2018, the Federal Reserve notified us that it has determined not to disapprove the Notice, subject to compliance by Mr. Lawrence and his affiliates with extensive representations and commitments set forth in correspondence between Mr. Lawrence and the Federal Reserve. On November 19, 2019, Mr. Lawrence filed an amended Schedule 13D in which he asserted that the Federal Reserve’s determination not to disapprove his Notice has now expired, and in which Mr. Lawrence further stated that he “does not presently intend to file a new Interagency Notice of Change in Control with the [Federal Reserve].” ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 35 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES CapStar Financial’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CSTR” and has traded on that market since September 22, 2016. Prior to that time, there was no established public trading market for our stock. The following table shows the high and low sales price information for our common stock for each full quarter in 2019 and 2018 as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Price Per Share High Low 2019: First quarter $ 17.33 $ 14.11 Second quarter 16.20 14.21 Third quarter 17.21 14.61 Fourth quarter 17.48 15.74 2018: First quarter $ 21.91 $ 17.36 Second quarter 20.87 17.39 Third quarter 19.98 15.88 Fourth quarter 17.40 13.51 As of March 5, 2020 there were approximately 2,545 holders of record of shares of our common stock. The following table shows information related to the repurchase of shares of common stock by the Company during the three months ended December 31, 2019. Total number of shares purchased (1) Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plan (2) Maximum amount that may yet be purchased under the plan October 1 - October 31 2,294 $ 16.56 — $9.00 million November 1 - November 30 221 16.91 — $9.00 million December 1 - December 31 2,808 17.08 — $9.00 million Total 5,323 $ 16.85 — $9.00 million (1) Activity represents shares of common stock withheld to pay purchase price and taxes due upon vesting of restricted shares and exercise of stock options. For information regarding securities authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans, please see “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management And Related Stockholder Matters”. (2) On December 21, 2018, the board of directors approved the Company’s share repurchase program which authorized the Company to repurchase up to $8 million of shares of common stock (the “Repurchase Program”). On September 5, 2019, the Board approved an expansion of the Repurchase Program (the “Expanded Repurchase Program”). Under the Expanded Repurchase Program, the amount of common stock that the Company is authorized to repurchase has been increased from approximately $2.2 million to $11 million. The Expanded Share Repurchase Program will terminate on the date on which the Expanded Maximum Dollar Amount of Common Stock has been repurchased.. 36 Stock Performance Graph The following stock performance graph compares total shareholders return on our common stock for the period beginning at the close of trading on September 22, 2016 until December 31, 2019, with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Bank Index for the same period. Cumulative total return is computed by dividing the difference between the share price of our common stock at the end and the beginning of the measurement period by the share price of our common stock at the beginning of the measurement period. The performance graph assumes $100 is invested on September 22, 2016 in shares of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Bank Index and that dividends are reinvested into additional shares of common stock at the same frequency with which dividends are paid on such shares during the applicable fiscal year. Historical stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The information in this paragraph and the following stock performance graph shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C, other than as provided in Item 201 of Regulation S-K, or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically request that such information be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporate it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

As a Tennessee corporation, we are not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. Because we are a bank holding company and do not engage directly in business activities of a material nature, our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock depends, in large part, upon our receipt of dividends from our bank, which is also subject to numerous limitations on the payment of dividends under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. Pursuant to Tennessee law, our bank may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank’s net income for that year plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. For additional information, see “Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Bank Regulation and Supervision—Payment of Dividends.” The following table shows the dividends that have been declared on our voting and non-voting common stock and preferred stock with respect to the periods indicated below. Per share amounts are presented to the nearest cent.

Subject to the regulatory restrictions noted above and satisfactory financial results, the Company currently expects that comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders in the future will depend on regulatory restrictions and our liquidity and capital requirements, as well as our earnings and financial condition, the general economic climate, contractual restrictions, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Use of Proceeds On September 27, 2016, the Company sold 1,688,049 shares of its common stock, including 387,750 shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to the full exercise of their purchase option, in its initial public offering (“IPO”). In addition, certain selling shareholders participated in the IPO and sold an aggregate of 1,284,701 shares of the Company’s common stock. The shares were sold at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $44.6 million. The aggregate offering price for the shares sold by the Company was approximately $25.3 million, and after deducting approximately $1.6 million for the underwriting discount and approximately $2.1 million of offering expenses paid to third parties, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $21.6 million. The aggregate offering price for the shares sold by the selling shareholders was approximately $19.3 million. All of the shares were sold pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-213367), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 21, 2016. The offering did not terminate until all of the shares offered were sold. The Company made no payments to its directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of its common stock or to their associates, or to its affiliates in connection with the issuance and sale of the common stock or in connection with the use of IPO proceeds. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. acted as lead book-running managers for the initial public offering. Our common stock is currently trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “CSTR.” There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our prospectus filed with the SEC on September 23, 2016 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act. Pending application of the IPO proceeds, we have invested the net proceeds in short-term investments. During 2017, the Company provided $10.0 million of the IPO proceeds as a capital contribution to the Bank for working capital purposes. 38 ITEM 6.

On October 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Athens and Athens Federal. For more information, please see “Item 1.—Business—Overview—Acquisitions”. The operations of Athens are included in our financial statements beginning October 1, 2018. The acquisition and incorporation of Athens into our financial statements may materially affect the comparability of the selected financial data provided for fiscal year 2018 as compared to previous years. 39 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under the caption “Part II., Item 8—Financial Statements, Supplementary Data and Financial Statement Schedules” in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law. The following discussion and analysis pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, the following discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level. All dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when otherwise specifically noted. Unless specifically noted in this Report, all references in this section to the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 mean our fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Overview We completed 2019 with net income of $22.4 million, or $1.20 diluted net income per share, compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $0.67 diluted net income per share, for 2018. Average loans for 2019 were $1.45 billion, a 27.9% increase over 2018, and average deposits for 2019 were $1.67 billion, a 34.2% increase over 2018. The comparability of our financial condition and performance has been impacted by our acquisition of Athens which we completed in 2018 and the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, in each case as discussed below. We acquired Athens on October 1, 2018. On the acquisition date, the fair market value of Athens’ net assets was $61.6 million, including $344.8 million in loans and $404.5 million in deposits. Net income for 2018 was reduced by $9.8 million of pretax merger related charges related to this acquisition. The Athens acquisition further expanded our franchise into the East Tennessee market. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Among other items, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of such decrease, we recognized an increase in income tax expense of $3.56 million in 2017 resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. Our primary revenue source is net interest income and fees from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to our overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and the rates paid on deposits directly impact our profitability. Business volumes are influenced by competition, new business acquisition efforts and economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence. Net interest income increased $16.0 million, or 31.1%, to $67.7 million for 2019 compared to $51.7 million for 2018. The positive effects of increased volumes and yields on earning assets were partially offset by the negative effects of increasing deposit costs. Net interest margin increased to 3.64% for 2019, compared with 3.55% for 2018. Provision for loan losses was $0.8 million in 2019 compared to $2.8 million in 2018, a 73.2% decrease. This decrease was primarily the result of lower charge-offs, which were $0.8 million in 2019 compared to $5.0 million in 2018. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management’s evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for the estimated probable inherent losses on outstanding loans. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was 0.89% of total loans, compared with 0.85% of total loans at December 31, 2018. 40 Total noninterest income for 201 9 in crease d $ 8.8 million, or 5 7 .0 %, to $ 24.3 million compared to $ 15.5 million for 201 8 , and comprised 21.0 % of total revenues. Total noninterest expense for 2019 increased $8.5 million, or 15.9%, to $62.0 million compared to $53.5 million for 2018. Our efficiency ratio for 2019 was 67.4% compared to 79.7% for 2018. The significant decrease in efficiency ratio for 2019 is primarily attributable to $9.8 million of merger related charges included in noninterest expense for 2018, compared to just $2.7 million in 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 23.4% for 2019 from 10.8% for 2018. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is mainly the result of the nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds received in 2018 as well as a larger amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation in 2018. Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a measure of a company's capital which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Our ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets was 11.47% as of December 31, 2019, compared with 10.39% at December 31, 2018. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The following sections provide more details on subjects presented in this overview. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which are contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may materially and adversely affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate. Allowance for Loan Losses We record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit-worthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans and on groups of loans that are not impaired, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is included elsewhere in this Report. 41 Investment Securities Impairment We assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is “more likely than not” that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period, and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits. Business Combinations Assets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the loans are considered impaired, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted as necessary for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisions that may be required.

Return on average shareholders’ equity was 8.49%, 5.50% and 1.05% for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 42 The following sections provide a more detailed analysis of significant factors affecting our operating results. Net Interest Income The largest component of our net income is net interest income – the difference between the income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets and interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent bais divided by total average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our net interest income. The following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Interest-Earning Assets Loans (1) $ 1,451,821 $ 78,557 5.41 % $ 1,134,836 $ 57,962 5.11 % $ 987,710 $ 43,531 4.41 % Loans held for sale 100,464 4,271 4.25 % 58,250 2,789 4.79 % 49,466 2,070 4.19 % Securities: Taxable investment securities (2) 176,647 5,374 3.04 % 166,287 4,755 2.86 % 166,538 4,092 2.46 % Investment securities exempt from federal income tax (3) 52,392 1,438 3.47 % 47,270 1,201 3.22 % 52,153 1,230 3.63 % Total securities 229,039 6,812 3.14 % 213,557 5,956 2.94 % 218,691 5,322 2.74 % Cash balances in other banks 87,305 1,881 2.15 % 54,454 1,011 1.85 % 49,990 551 1.10 % Funds sold 752 26 3.52 % 2,483 63 2.55 % 2,518 41 1.63 % Total interest-earning assets 1,869,381 91,547 4.92 % 1,463,580 67,781 4.65 % 1,308,375 51,515 3.99 % Noninterest-earning assets 137,947 65,336 49,419 Total assets $ 2,007,328 $ 1,528,916 $ 1,357,794 Interest-Bearing Liabilities Interest bearing deposits: Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 499,468 7,538 1.51 % $ 330,952 4,164 1.26 % $ 301,411 2,447 0.81 % Savings and money market deposits 494,587 7,266 1.47 % 424,052 5,446 1.28 % 378,640 3,188 0.84 % Time deposits 361,956 7,542 2.08 % 227,760 3,940 1.73 % 194,892 2,445 1.25 % Total interest-beraring deposits 1,356,011 22,346 1.65 % 982,764 13,550 1.38 % 874,943 8,080 0.92 % Borrowings and repurchase agreements 48,629 1,453 2.99 % 99,450 2,539 2.55 % 98,289 1,572 1.60 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,404,640 23,799 1.69 % 1,082,214 16,089 1.49 % 973,232 9,652 0.99 % Noninterest-bearing deposits 315,031 262,280 232,687 Total funding sources 1,719,671 1,344,494 1,205,919 Noninterest-bearing liabilities 23,533 8,736 8,473 Shareholders’ equity 264,124 175,686 143,402 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 2,007,328 $ 1,528,916 $ 1,357,794 Net interest spread (4) 3.22 % 3.17 % 3.00 % Net interest income/margin (5) $ 67,748 3.64 % $ 51,692 3.55 % $ 41,863 3.25 % (1) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans.

The following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates earned or paid on these assets and liabilities. 2019 Compared to 2018 2018 Compared to 2017 Increase (decrease) due to Increase (decrease) due to Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net Interest-Earning Assets Loans $ 16,190 $ 4,405 $ 20,595 $ 6,484 $ 7,947 $ 14,431 Loans held for sale 2,022 (540 ) 1,482 368 351 719 Securities: Taxable investment securities 296 323 619 (6 ) 670 664 Investment securities exempt from federal income tax 165 72 237 (115 ) 85 (30 ) Total securities 461 395 856 (121 ) 755 634 Cash Balances In Other Banks 609 261 870 49 410 459 Funds Sold (44 ) 7 (37 ) (1 ) 24 23 Total interest-earning assets 19,238 4,528 23,766 6,779 9,487 16,266 Interest Bearing Liabilities Interest-bearing transaction accounts 2,120 1,254 3,374 240 1,477 1,717 Savings and money market deposits 906 914 1,820 382 1,876 2,258 Time deposits 2,321 1,281 3,602 412 1,084 1,496 Borrowings and repurchase agreements (1,297 ) 211 (1,086 ) 19 947 966 Total interest-bearing liabilities 4,050 3,660 7,710 1,053 5,384 6,437 Net Interest Income $ 15,188 $ 868 $ 16,056 $ 5,726 $ 4,103 $ 9,829 2019 compared to 2018 Our net interest income increased $16.1 million, or 31.1%, from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to increasing loan volumes and interest rates rising at a faster pace than interest bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin was 3.64% and 3.55% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. For 2019 and 2018, average loan yields increased from 5.11% to 5.41% which was primarily driven by increases in short-term interest rate indexes affecting the variable rate portion of our loan portfolio, offset by competitive pricing pressures, as well as realizing a full year of additional interest income related to the acquisition of Athens, including additional interest income as a result of accretable yield. The full year average LIBOR – 1 month interest rate increased from 2.02% in 2018 to 2.23% in 2019. Similarly, the full year average Bank Prime Loan Rate increased from 4.90% in 2018 to 5.28% in 2019. Approximately 55% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 was variable in nature, a significant portion of which is indexed to 1 month LIBOR and the Bank Prime Loan Rate. Average loans for 2019 increased 27.9% compared to 2018 as a result of the Athens acquisition, adding new bankers in the Nashville MSA and continued focus on attracting new clients. Average security yields increased from 2.94% to 3.14% for 2018 and 2019, respectively, primarily due to increases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio. The resulting yield on average interest-earning assets increased 27 basis points for 2019 compared to 2018. We funded our growth in loans through an increase in funding sources of 27.9% from 2018 to 2019. The primary driver of our increased funding sources was growth in our deposits of 34.2% from 2018 to 2019 which was largely driven by the Athens acquisition. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased 20.1% from 2018 to 2019. 44 The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.69% for 2019 compared to 1.49% for 2018. The majority of this increase was due to increases in the Fed Funds rate. The full year average Fed Funds rate increased from 1.83% in 2018 to 2.16% in 2019. 2018 compared to 2017 Our net interest income increased $9.8 million, or 23.5%, from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to increasing loan volumes and interest rates rising at a faster pace than interest bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin was 3.55% and 3.25% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. For 2018 and 2017, average loan yields increased from 4.41% to 5.11% which was primarily driven by increases in short-term interest rate indexes affecting the variable rate portion of our loan portfolio, offset by competitive pricing pressures. From December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the LIBOR – 1 month interest rate increased from 1.56% to 2.50%. Approximately 58% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 was variable in nature and indexed to 1 month LIBOR. Average loans for 2018 increased 14.9% compared to 2017 as a result of the Athens acquisition, adding new bankers in the Nashville MSA and continued focus on attracting new clients. Average security yields increased from 2.74% to 2.94% for 2017 and 2018, respectively, primarily due to increases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio. The resulting yield on average interest-earning assets increased 66 basis points for 2018 compared to 2017. We funded our growth in loans through an increase in funding sources of 11.5% from 2017 to 2018. The primary driver of our increased funding sources was growth in our deposits of 12.4% from 2017 to 2018 which was largely driven by the Athens acquisition. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased 12.7% from 2017 to 2018. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.49% for 2018 compared to 0.99% for 2017. The majority of this increase was due to increases in the Fed Funds rate. The Fed Funds rate increased from 1.33% at December 31, 2017 to 2.40% at December 31, 2018. We passed along 50 basis points of the rate increase to our clients. Provision for Loan losses Our policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.89%, 0.85% and 1.45% at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 2019 compared to 2018 The provision for loan losses amounted to $0.8 million and $2.8 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Provision expense is impacted by the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of net charge-offs. Provision expense decreased for 2019 compared to 2018 due to decreased charge-offs. Charge-offs for 2019 were $0.8 million compared to $5.0 million for 2018. Of the $5.0 million in charge offs during 2018, $4.6 million was attributable to a single borrower. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 0.85% at December 31, 2018 to 0.89% at December 31, 2019. This increase was largely due to our assessment of risk generally related to macro-economic, geo-political conditions and asset quality. In addition, during 2019, we increased the look-back period, from which we calculate peer bank historical loss experience, from 37 to 41 quarters. Our look-back period is utilized to calculate peer historical loss experience, adjusted for current factors, to comprise the general component of the allowance for loan losses. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period is necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. The extension of the historical look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets, or particular industry or borrower-specific conditions, which may materially and negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses. 45 201 8 compared to 201 7 The provision for loan losses amounted to $2.8 million and $12.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Provision expense decreased for 2018 compared to 2017 due to decreased charge-offs. Charge-offs for 2018 were $5.0 million compared to $12.8 million for 2017. In particular, during the second quarter of 2017, we charged-off the loans associated with one specific borrower as credit quality deteriorated and issues emerged which undermined our assessment that an expedient and positive outcome was possible. This particular charge-off, net of recoveries, amounted to $9.1 million in the aggregate. These loans experienced weakness due to the borrower’s declining financial condition, which led to falling values of the collateral securing these loans. Our primary collateral for these loans was the enterprise value of the borrower as determined by an Asset Purchase Agreement that was subsequently withdrawn. As the financial condition of the borrower deteriorated, ultimate repayment became increasingly difficult. We determined that timely repayment of these loans was unlikely and charged-off the loans. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.45% at December 31, 2017 to 0.85% at December 31, 2018. This decrease was largely due to the acquired Athens loan portfolio which was accounted for at its fair value as of the acquisition date. A preliminary fair value discount of $4.8 million was applied to the Athens loan portfolio. In addition, during 2018, we increased the look-back period, from which we calculate peer bank historical loss experience, from 33 to 37 quarters. Noninterest Income In addition to net interest income, we generate recurring noninterest income. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We have mortgage banking activities that generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, the origination and sale of commercial real estate loans, and we have a revenue-sharing relationship with a registered broker-dealer, which generates wealth management fees. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, we own insurance on several key employees and record income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. The following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated. 2019-2018 2018-2017 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2019 2018 (Decrease) 2017 (Decrease) Noninterest income: Treasury management and other deposit service charges $ 3,135 $ 2,150 45.8 % $ 1,516 41.8 % Net gain (loss) on sale of securities (99 ) 3 (3400.0 )% (66 ) (104.5 )% Tri-Net fees 2,785 1,503 85.3 % 1,002 50.0 % Mortgage banking income 9,467 5,653 67.5 % 6,238 (9.4 )% Other noninterest income 8,986 6,150 46.1 % 2,218 177.3 % Total noninterest income $ 24,274 $ 15,459 57.0 % $ 10,908 41.7 % 2019 compared to 2018 The increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2019 was driven primarily by the incremental increase in transaction volume related to our acquisition of Athens, as well as growth in the volume of our commercial and consumer deposit accounts. Tri-Net fees, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, is derived from the origination and sale of commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. The volume of loan sales has increased through continued to growth and development. 46 Mortgage banking income consists of mortgage fee income from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Mortgage banking income increased 67.5% from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to a significantly higher volume of originations. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2019 , we implemented a hedging progra m for residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. In connection with this program, we elected the fair value option for this portfolio . The fair value adjustments for applicable loans held for sale and related derivative instruments at December 31, 2019 resulted in a $1.1 million increase to mortgage banking income for 2019 when compared to 2018 . Other noninterest income primarily consists of loan related fees, interchange income and wealth management income. The increase of $2.8 million from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to organic growth and our acquisition of Athens. 2018 compared to 2017 The increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2018 and 2017 was driven primarily our acquisition of Athens and by transaction volume, which can fluctuate throughout and from year to year. Growth in the volume of our commercial and consumer deposit accounts was the primary contributor to the increase. Tri-Net fees has steadily increased since it was implemented. Mortgage banking income decreased 9.4% from 2017 to 2018 due to a lower volume of originations. The increase in other noninterest income of $3.9 million from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to $2.0 million in non-taxable life insurance death benefit proceeds recognized in 2018 and our acquisition of Athens. Noninterest Expense Our total noninterest expense increase reflects expenses that we have incurred as we build the foundation to support our recent growth and enable us to execute our growth strategy. The following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated. 2019-2018 2018-2017 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2019 2018 (Decrease) 2017 (Decrease) Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits $ 35,542 $ 28,586 24.3 % $ 20,400 40.1 % Data processing and software 6,961 3,835 81.5 % 2,786 37.7 % Professional fees 2,102 1,608 30.7 % 1,522 5.7 % Occupancy 3,345 2,336 43.2 % 2,025 15.4 % Equipment 3,723 2,471 50.7 % 2,071 19.3 % Regulatory fees 591 1,028 (42.5 )% 1,111 (7.5 )% Merger related expenses 2,654 9,803 100.0 % — — Amortization of intangibles 1,655 465 255.9 % 48 868.8 % Other operating 5,422 3,355 61.6 % 3,802 (11.8 )% Total noninterest expense $ 61,995 $ 53,487 15.9 % $ 33,765 58.4 % 47 2019 compared to 2018 The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by the incremental increase in compensation costs related to our acquisition of Athens and 2019 being the first full year of Athens’ related compensation costs being recognized. At December 31, 2019, our associate base had slightly decreased to 289 compared to 295 at December 31, 2018. Data processing and software expense increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth, costs associated with running dual systems related to our acquisition of Athens and insourcing certain IT related functions. The Athens related systems conversion was successfully completed during the second quarter of 2019. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense from 2018 to 2019 was largely attributable to increased depreciation and other facilities related expenses associated with our acquisition of Athens as well as the increasing cost of managing our IT network. Amortization of intangibles increased from 2018 to 2019 due to the new core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the Athens acquisition. Our efficiency ratio was 67.4% and 79.7% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income and measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. As expected, the efficiency ratio improved in 2019 due to the majority of the non-recurring merger expenses incurred in 2018. 2018 compared to 2017 The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in 2018 over 2017. At December 31, 2018, our associate base had expanded to 295 compared to 175 at December 31, 2017. Included in salaries and benefits are stock compensation and cash incentives, which increased over the prior year by approximately $3.8 million due to retention of key employees and improved financial performance of the Company. Data processing and software expense increased from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth and costs associated with running dual systems related to our acquisition of Athens. We expect the Athens related systems conversion to occur during the second quarter of 2019. The increase in equipment expense from 2017 to 2018 was related to the increasing cost of managing our IT network. Merger related expenses relate to our acquisition of Athens. Amortization of intangibles increased from 2017 to 2018 due to the new core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the Athens acquisition. Our efficiency ratio was 79.7% and 64.0% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The efficiency ratio was negatively impacted by merger expenses in 2018. Income Taxes 2019 compared to 2018 We recorded income tax expense of $6.8 million and $1.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2019 and 2018 was 23.4% and 10.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate by our investments in municipal securities, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is mainly the result of the nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds received in 2018 as well as a larger amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation in 2018. 2018 compared to 2017 We recorded income tax expense of $1.2 million and $4.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2018 and 2017 was 10.8% and 75.5%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate by our investments in municipal securities, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation and the 2017 tax law change. During 2018, the Company received $2.0 million in nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds resulting in a lower effective tax rate for 2018 compared to 2017. 48 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted into law. The Tax Reform Act provides for significant changes to the U.S. tax code that impact businesses. Effective January 1, 2018, the U.S. federa l tax rate for corporations was reduced from 35% to 21%, for U.S. taxable income and requires a one-time re-measurement of deferred taxes to reflect their value at a lower tax rate of 21%. Accordingly, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company is required to revalue its net deferred tax assets to account for the future impact of lowe r corporate tax rates on this deferred amount and record any change in the value of such assets as a one-time, non-cash charge on its income statement. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we recorded a $3.6 million increase in income tax expense for 2017. If we were to adjust this $3.6 million write-down out of income tax expense, our adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 17.5%. Financial Condition 2019 compared to 2018 Total assets increased $73.3 million, or 3.7%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Loans decreased from $1.430 billion at December 31, 2018 to $1.420 billion at December 31, 2019, a 0.7% decrease. Loans held for sale increased $110.6 million, or 192.0%, during 2019 which is primarily related to transaction volume of selling residential and commercial real estate loans as a result of continued strong growth. Securities decreased $31.1 million, or 12.6%. Total liabilities increased $54.7 million, or 3.2%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Deposits increased from $1.570 billion at December 31, 2018 to $1.729 billion at December 31, 2019, a 10.2% increase. We paid down our Federal Home Loan Bank advances $115.0 million, or 92.0%, from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 as we were able to rely more on deposit funding. 2018 compared to 2017 Total assets increased $619.5 million, or 46.1%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Loans grew from $947.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $1.430 billion at December 31, 2018, a 50.9% increase. Loans held for sale decreased $16.5 million, or 22.2%, during 2018 which is primarily related to the timing of selling residential and commercial real estate loans. Securities increased $51.2 million, or 26.1%. Included in these changes is growth from our acquisition of Athens which included $473.0 million in total assets, primarily made up of $344.8 million in loans and $67.4 million in securities. Total liabilities increased $512.0 million, or 42.8%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Deposits increased from $1.120 billion at December 31, 2017 to $1.570 billion at December 31, 2018, a 40.2% increase. We increased our Federal Home Loan Bank advances $55.0 million, or 78.6%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 to help fund loan growth. Total liabilities and deposits from our Athens acquisition were $411.4 million and $404.5 million, respectively. Investment Securities The primary purpose of our investment portfolio is to provide another source of interest income, as well as liquidity management. In managing the composition of the balance sheet, we seek a balance between earnings sources and credit and liquidity considerations. We manage our investment portfolio according to a written investment policy approved by our board of directors. Balances in our investment portfolio are subject to change over time based on our funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credit, and are maintained at levels we believe are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities, all with varying contractual maturities. However, these maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as some of these securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. The investment portfolio is regularly reviewed by the Asset Liability Management committee, or ALCO, of the bank to ensure an appropriate risk and return profile as well as for adherence to the investment policy. 49 Our investment portfolio totaled $216.4 million, $ 247.5 million , and $ 196.4 million at December 31, 2019, 201 8 and 201 7 , respectively. Excluding investment securities acquired in our acquisition of Athens, o ur investment portfolio has trended down over the past several years as we have redeployed these funds into higher-earning loans. See “Note 3 to our Consolidated Fi nancial Statements” for additional information on our investment securities. The following table presents the fair value of our securities as of December 31, 2019 by their stated maturities (this maturity schedule excludes security prepayment and call features), as well as the weighted average yields for each maturity range.

Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. The composition of gross loans and leases at December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate - owner occupied $ 172,456 12.1 % $ 141,864 9.9 % $ 101,132 10.7 % $ 106,735 11.4 % $ 108,132 13.4 % Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied 387,443 27.3 % 408,582 28.6 % 249,490 26.3 % 195,587 20.9 % 143,065 17.7 % Consumer real estate 256,097 18.0 % 253,562 17.7 % 102,581 10.8 % 97,015 10.4 % 93,785 11.6 % Construction and land development 143,111 10.1 % 174,670 12.2 % 82,586 8.7 % 94,491 10.1 % 52,522 6.5 % Commercial and industrial 394,408 27.8 % 404,600 28.3 % 373,248 39.4 % 379,620 40.6 % 353,442 43.7 % Consumer 28,426 2.0 % 25,615 1.8 % 6,862 0.7 % 5,974 0.6 % 8,668 1.1 % Other 38,161 2.7 % 20,901 1.5 % 31,638 3.3 % 55,829 6.0 % 48,782 6.0 % Total gross loans and leases $ 1,420,102 100.0 % $ 1,429,794 100.0 % $ 947,537 100.0 % $ 935,251 100.0 % $ 808,396 100.0 % Over the past five years, we have experienced significant growth in our loan portfolio. During 2015 and continuing through 2019, we recognized growth in the commercial real estate loan classifications reflecting the development of the Target Market in which we operate. The acquisition of Athens increased all loan classifications and provided further diversity in our loan portfolio through more consumer oriented loan products. 50 Our primary focus has been on commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending, which constituted 56 % of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 201 9 . Although we expect continued growt h with respect to our loan portfolio, we do not expect any significant changes over the foreseeable future in the composition of our loan portfolio or in our emphasis on commercial lending. Our loan growth since inception has been reflective of the Target Market in which we serve. The commercial real estate category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans which are similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the affiliated business rather than on the valuation and cash flows of the real estate from unaffiliated tenants . Since 2009, our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios have continued to experience strong growth, primarily due to implementation of our relationship-based banking model and the success of our relationship managers in transitioning commercial banking relationships from other local financial institutions and in competing for new business from attractive small to mid-sized commercial clients. Many of our larger commercial clients have lengthy relationships with members of our senior management team or our relationship managers that date back to their employment by other financial institutions. The repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes for our loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. December 31, 2019 Due in 1 year or less Due in 1-5 years Due after 5 years Total Commercial real estate $ 47,648 $ 361,295 $ 150,956 $ 559,899 Consumer real estate 12,443 36,332 207,322 256,097 Construction and land development 37,175 64,182 41,754 143,111 Commercial and industrial 113,032 233,402 47,974 394,408 Consumer 10,856 17,074 496 28,426 Other 5,343 25,553 7,265 38,161 Total gross loans $ 226,497 $ 737,838 $ 455,767 $ 1,420,102 Interest rate sensitivity Fixed interest rates 39,789 408,017 186,967 634,773 Floating or adjustable interest rates 186,708 329,821 268,800 785,329 Total gross loans $ 226,497 $ 737,838 $ 455,767 $ 1,420,102 The information presented in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio. Asset Quality One of our key objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality in our loan portfolio. We utilize disciplined and thorough underwriting processes that collaboratively engage our seasoned and experienced business bankers, credit underwriters and portfolio managers in the analysis of each loan request. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ scaled review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. In addition, we have adopted underwriting guidelines to be followed by our lending officers that require senior management review of proposed extensions of credit exceeding certain thresholds. When delinquencies exist, we monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. Our loan review procedures include approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors of our bank, an independent loan review, approval of larger credit relationships by our bank’s Credit Committee and loan quality documentation procedures. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to the risk that our loan portfolio will be subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. 51 We target small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of such businesses and other consumers and high net worth individuals as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive or economic pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance fo r loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We use an independent consulting firm to review our loans for quality in addition to the reviews that may be conducted internally and by bank regulatory agencies as pa rt of their examination process. Our bank has procedures and processes in place intended to assess whether losses exceed the potential amounts documented in our bank’s impairment analyses and to reduce potential losses in the remaining performing loans wit hin our loan portfolio. These procedures and processes include the following: • we monitor the past due and overdraft reports on a weekly basis to identify deterioration as early as possible and the placement of identified loans on the watch list; • we perform quarterly credit reviews for all watch list/classified loans, including formulation of action plans. When a workout is not achievable, we move to collection/foreclosure proceedings to obtain control of the underlying collateral as rapidly as possible to minimize the deterioration of collateral and/or the loss of its value; • we require updated financial information, global inventory aging and interest carry analysis where appropriate for existing borrowers to help identify potential future loan payment problems; and • we generally limit loans for new construction to established builders and developers that have an established record of turning their inventories, and we restrict our funding of undeveloped lots and land. Our bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Our bank analyzes loans individually by classifying each loan as to credit risk. This analysis includes all commercial loans and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000, individually. This analysis is performed on a regular basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least a semi-annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the risk rating of each loan in the sample. See “Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for a table that provides the risk category of loans by applicable class of loans. Non-Performing Loans and Assets Information summarizing non-performing assets, including non-accrual loans follows. December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Non-accrual loans $ 1,464 $ 2,078 $ 2,695 $ 3,619 $ 2,689 Troubled debt restructurings 2,717 1,391 1,206 1,272 125 Loans past due greater than 89 days and still accruing 38 214 231 — — Non-performing loans 1,464 2,078 2,695 3,619 2,689 Foreclosed real estate 1,044 988 — — 216 Non-performing assets $ 2,508 $ 3,066 $ 2,695 $ 3,619 $ 2,905 Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.10 % 0.15 % 0.28 % 0.39 % 0.33 % Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.12 % 0.16 % 0.20 % 0.27 % 0.24 % 52 The balance of non-performing assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. We have established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on loans (that is, place the loans on non-accrual status) after they have become 90 days delinquent as t o payment of principal or interest, unless the loans are considered to be well-collateralized and are in the process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In addition, a loan will not be placed on non-accrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of all principal and interest is not expected in a timely manner . Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against interest income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. If we believe that a loan will not be collected in full, we will increase the allowance for loan losses to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied directly to principal. As of December 31, 201 9 , there were not any loans, outside of those included in the table above, that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of b orrowers to comply with present repayment terms. Due to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. The effect of these changes is assessed to determine if the loan should be classified as a Troubled Debt Restructure. Loans that have been restructured that are on non-accruing status as of the date of restructuring, are included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and are classified as impaired loans. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired. Allowance for Loan Losses (allowance) Our allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above and in Notes 1 and 4 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” The following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods and dates indicated. Year ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Total loans outstanding, net of unearned income $ 1,420,102 $ 1,429,794 $ 947,537 $ 935,251 $ 808,396 Average loans outstanding, net of unearned income 1,451,821 1,134,836 987,710 888,541 744,151 Allowance for loan and lease losses at beginning of period 12,113 13,721 11,634 10,132 11,282 Charge-offs: Commercial real estate — — — 350 — Consumer real estate 39 — — — 173 Construction and land development — — — — — Commercial and industrial 455 4,831 12,769 956 3,033 Consumer 164 84 — 146 — Other 140 39 — — — Total charge-offs 798 4,954 12,769 1,452 3,206 Recoveries: Commercial real estate 23 22 9 52 31 Consumer real estate 20 4 — — 68 Construction and land development — — — — — Commercial and industrial 380 395 1,865 23 299 Consumer 82 75 112 50 7 Other 23 8 — — — Total recoveries 528 504 1,986 125 405 Net charge-offs 270 4,450 10,783 1,327 2,801 Provision for loan and lease losses 761 2,842 12,870 2,829 1,651 Allowance for loan and lease losses at period end $ 12,604 $ 12,113 $ 13,721 $ 11,634 $ 10,132 Allowance for loan and lease losses to period end loans 0.89 % 0.85 % 1.45 % 1.24 % 1.25 % Net charge-offs to average loans 0.02 % 0.39 % 1.09 % 0.15 % 0.38 % 53 See “Provision for Loan losses” above for discussion of the changes in the provision for loan losses. While no portion of our allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following tables represent management’s allocation of our allowance to specific loan categories for the periods indicated. December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate $ 3,599 28.6 % $ 3,309 27.3 % $ 3,324 24.2 % $ 2,655 22.8 % $ 2,879 28.4 % Consumer real estate 1,231 9.8 % 1,005 8.3 % 1,063 7.7 % 1,013 8.7 % 968 9.6 % Construction and land development 2,058 16.3 % 2,431 20.1 % 1,628 11.9 % 1,574 13.5 % 914 9.0 % Commercial and industrial 5,074 40.3 % 5,036 41.6 % 7,209 52.5 % 5,618 48.3 % 4,693 46.3 % Consumer 222 1.8 % 105 0.9 % 91 0.7 % 76 0.7 % 103 1.0 % Other 420 3.3 % 227 1.9 % 406 3.0 % 698 6.0 % 575 5.7 % Total allowance for loan and lease losses $ 12,604 100.0 % $ 12,113 100.0 % $ 13,721 100.0 % $ 11,634 100.0 % $ 10,132 100.0 % Changes in the allocation of the allowance from year to year in various categories are influenced by the level of net charge-offs in respective categories and other factors including, but not limited to, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and trends, risk allocations tied to specific loans or groups of loans and changes in qualitative allocations. Management believes that allocations for each loan category are reasonable and reflective of risk inherent in the portfolio. Deposits Client deposits are the primary funding source for our loan growth. The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on deposits for each of the following categories for the periods indicated. Year ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Types of Deposits: Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 315,031 0.00 % $ 262,280 0.00 % $ 232,687 0.00 % Interest-bearing demand deposits 499,468 1.51 % 330,952 1.26 % 301,411 0.81 % Money market accounts 444,685 1.62 % 409,055 1.33 % 375,688 0.85 % Savings accounts 49,902 0.08 % 14,997 0.09 % 2,952 0.15 % Time deposits, $100,000 and over 267,509 2.21 % 177,366 1.76 % 155,788 1.13 % Time deposits, less than $100,000 94,447 1.72 % 50,395 1.63 % 39,104 1.76 % Total deposits $ 1,671,042 1.34 % $ 1,245,045 1.09 % $ 1,107,630 0.73 % Total average deposits increased 34.2% in 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 12.4% in 2018 compared to 2017. Much of the growth in deposits in 2018 is related to our acquisition of Athens. However, we have been able to increase average noninterest-bearing demand deposits each year as we focus on building and expanding client relationships. The Target Market is a competitive market for deposits and we experienced some run-off in rate sensitive deposits during 2018 and 2019. The following table presents the maturities of our certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2019. December 31, 2019 Three months or less Over three through six months Over six through twelve months Over twelve months Total $100,000 or more $ 64,132 $ 34,462 $ 76,885 $ 54,543 $ 230,022 Less than $100,000 14,728 11,410 20,546 26,746 73,430 Total $ 78,860 $ 45,872 $ 97,431 $ 81,289 $ 303,452 54 Capital Adequacy As of December 31, 2019, CapStar Financial’s capital ratios were as follows. Well Capitalized Guidelines December 31, 2019 Total risk-based capital 10.0% 13.5% Tier 1 risk-based capital 8.0% 12.7% Common equity tier 1 capital 6.5% 12.7% Tier 1 leverage 5.0% 11.4% See Note 15 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to our capital position. Market and Liquidity Risk Management Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of our established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our ALCO is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure an acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. Interest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis Managing interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity while attempting to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer requirements. We use earnings at risk, or EAR, simulations to assess the impact of changing rates on earnings under a variety of scenarios and time horizons. The simulation model is designed to reflect the dynamics of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments. These simulations utilize both instantaneous and parallel changes in the level of interest rates, as well as non-parallel changes such as changing slopes and twists of the yield curve. Static simulation models are based on current exposures and assume a constant balance sheet with no new growth. Dynamic simulation models are also utilized that rely on detailed assumptions regarding changes in existing products, new business, and changes in management and client behavior. By estimating the effects of interest rate increases and decreases, the model can reveal approximate interest rate risk exposure. The simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in interest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and does not indicate actual expected results. At December 31, 2019, our EAR static simulation results indicated that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to parallel shifts in interest rates. This indicates that our assets generally reprice faster than our liabilities, which results in a favorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates increase and an unfavorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates decline. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity and decay rates, and key rate drivers. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may, and most likely will, differ from our static EAR results. In addition, static EAR results do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client behavior. For example, as part of our asset/liability management strategy, management has the ability to increase asset duration and/or decrease liability duration in order to reduce asset sensitivity, or to decrease asset duration and/or increase liability duration in order to increase asset sensitivity. 55 The following table illustrates the results of our EAR analysis to determine the extent to which our net interest i ncome over the next 12 months would change if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts. Net interest income change Increase 200bp 1.9 % Increase 100bp 1.0 Decrease 100bp (4.1 ) Decrease 200bp (8.3 ) Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. To manage liquidity risk, management has established a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is fully integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; appropriate strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems (including assessments of the current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are commensurate with the complexity and business activities of the Bank; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; adequate levels of highly liquid marketable securities free of legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that can be used to meet liquidity needs in stressful situations; comprehensive contingency funding plans that sufficiently address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes sufficient to determine the adequacy of the institution’s liquidity risk management process. The role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors’ withdrawal and borrowers’ credit demands while at the same time optimizing financial results within our corporate guidelines. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of those funds. Liquidity is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, investment securities available-for-sale, various lines of credit available to us, and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally deposits. Our most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, available-for-sale marketable investment securities and federal funds sold. The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was $213.1 million at December 31, 2019. We pledge portions of our investment securities portfolio to secure public fund deposits, derivative positions and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. At December 31, 2019, total investment securities pledged for these purposes comprised 32% of the estimated fair value of the entire investment portfolio, leaving $146.2 million of unpledged securities. We have a large base of non-maturity customer deposits, defined as demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts. At December 31, 2019, such deposits totaled $1.4 billion and represented 82% of our total deposits. Other sources of funds available to meet daily needs include FHLB advances. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, the Company has access to credit products offered by the FHLB. The Company views these borrowings as a low cost alternative to other time deposits. At December 31, 2019, available credit from the FHLB totaled $201.4 million. Additionally, we had available federal funds purchased lines with correspondent banks totaling $107.5 million at December 31, 2019. The principal source of cash for CapStar Financial is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. At December 31, 2019, the Bank was able to pay up to $35.8 million in dividends to CapStar Financial without regulatory approval subject to the ongoing capital requirements of the Bank. Accordingly, management believes that our funding sources are at sufficient levels to satisfy our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 56 Contractual Obligations The following table presents additional information about contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019, which by their terms have contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2019. Contractual Obligations: Due in 1 year or less Due after 1 through 3 years Due after 3 through 5 years Due after 5 years Total FHLB advances $ 10,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 10,000 Certificates of deposits $100,000 or more 175,479 47,382 6,560 601 230,022 Certificates of deposits less than $100,000 46,684 21,950 4,784 12 73,430 Lease liabilities 1,562 3,066 2,555 7,710 14,893 Total $ 233,725 $ 72,398 $ 13,899 $ 8,323 $ 328,345 Borrowings The following table outlines our sources of short-term borrowed funds during the year ended December 31, 2019, and the amount outstanding at the end of each period, the maximum amount, average amount and average interest rate that we paid for each borrowing source during the period. The maximum month end balance represents the high indebtedness of borrowed funds at any time during each of the periods shown. Stated period end rates are contractual rates. As of or for the year ended December 31, 2019 Average for the period Ending balance Stated period end rate Maximum month end balance Balance Rate Short-term borrowed funds: Short-term FHLB advances $ 10,000 2.05% $ 170,000 $ 49,000 2.45 % Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our clients. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold. We enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon clients maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. In the event that the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the client. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. We minimize our exposure to loss under loan commitments and standby letters of credit by subjecting them to the same credit approval and monitoring procedures as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses. The effect on our revenue, expenses, cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. 57 Our off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated. Contract or notional amount December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 672,933 $ 707,675 $ 584,494 Standby letters of credit 9,634 12,273 11,552 Total $ 682,567 $ 719,948 $ 596,046 Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Report includes the following financial measures that have been prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“non-GAAP financial measures”): tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible common equity per share. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enable a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business, and (iii) allow investors to evaluate the Company’s performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators; however, the Company acknowledges that its non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. The following table presents a reconciliation of tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible book value per share of common stock to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Impact of Inflation The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. ITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting under PCAOB standards. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Elliott Davis, LLC We have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.

consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 include CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and it’s wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank (the “Bank”, together referred to as the “Company”). Significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. On February 5, 2016, CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. acquired all of the Bank’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, preferred stock, common stock options and warrants, and the Bank became the wholly owned subsidiary of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (the “Share Exchange”). The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Under this method, all identifiable assets acquired, including purchased loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The Company typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of shares of common stock issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition. Nature of Operations Through the Bank, the Company provides full banking services to consumer and corporate customers located primarily in Tennessee. The Bank operates under a state bank charter and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a state member bank, the Bank is subject to regulations of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, determination of impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, the valuation of our investment portfolio and deferred tax assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds sold are purchased and sold for one-day periods. The Company maintains deposits in excess of the federal insurance amounts with other financial institutions. Management makes deposits only with financial institutions it considers to be financially sound. 67 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Securities The Bank accounts for securities under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities . Under the provisions of FASB ASC 320, securities are to be classified in three categories and accounted for as follows: Securities Held-to-Maturity - Debt securities are classified as held to maturity securities when the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Trading Securities - Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. No securities have been classified as trading securities. Securities Available-for-Sale - Debt securities not classified as either held to maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities. Securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Realized gains and losses from the sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific-identification method. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and any collateral underlying the relevant security. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: (1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and (2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. Loans Held For Sale and Fair Value Option The Company classifies loans as loans held for sale when originated with the intent to sell. As of April 1, 2019, the Company elected the fair value option for all residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell. This election allows for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. The Company has not elected the fair value option for other loans held for sale primarily because they are not economically hedged using derivative instruments. The fair value of residential mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell is based on traded market prices of similar assets. Other loans held for sale that are recorded at lower of cost or fair value may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when the fair value is less than cost. For further information, see Note 24 - Fair Value. The Company does not securitize mortgage loans. If the Company sells loans with servicing rights retained, the carrying value of the mortgage loan sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. Fair values of residential mortgage loans held for sale are based on traded market prices of similar assets. The changes in fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income and included gains of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no loans held for sale recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the difference between the fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for residential real estate loans held for sale as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Fair Value Aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance Difference December 31, 2019 Residential mortgage loans held for sale $ 30,740 $ 30,178 $ 562 68 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Tri-Net Fees Tri-Net fees are derived from the origination, with the intent to sell, commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Realized gains and losses are recognized when legal title of the loan has transferred to the investor and sales proceeds have been received and are reflected in the accompanying statements of income in Tri-Net fees, net of related costs such as commission expenses. Loans that have not been sold at period end are classified as held for sale on the balance sheet and recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. Loans The Company has six classes of loans for financial reporting purposes: commercial real estate, consumer real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, consumer and other. The appropriate classification is determined based on the underlying collateral utilized to secure each loan. Commercial real estate loans are categorized as such based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial real estate also includes owner occupied commercial real estate. Consumer real estate consists primarily of 1-4 family residential properties including home equity lines of credit. Construction and land development loans include loans where the repayment is dependent on the successful completion and operation and/or sale of the related real estate project. Construction and land development loans include 1-4 family construction projects and commercial construction endeavors such as warehouses, apartments, office and retail space and land acquisition and development. Commercial and industrial loans include loans to business enterprises issued for commercial, industrial and/or other professional purposes. Consumer loans include all loans issued to individuals not included in the consumer real estate class. Other loans include all loans not included in the classes of loans above and leases. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest is typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful and collection is highly questionable. Amortization of deferred loan fees is discontinued when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Under the cash-basis method, interest income is recorded when the payment is received in cash. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Loans can also be returned to accrual status when they become well secured and in the process of collection. 69 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Acquired Loans Acquired loans are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on assumptions regarding the amount and timing of principal and interest payments, estimated prepayments, estimated default rates, estimated loss severity in the event of defaults, and current market rates. Estimated credit losses are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded on the acquisition date. An acquired loan is considered purchased credit impaired when there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually or aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics such as loan type and risk rating. The Company estimates the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan or pool, and the expected cash flows in excess of amount paid (fair value) is recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool (accretable yield). The excess of the loan’s or pool’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (nonaccretable difference). Over the life of the loan or pool, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded as a provision for loan losses. If the present value of expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income. Acquired non-impaired loans are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisioning that may be required. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is maintained at a level that management believes to be adequate to absorb expected loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Quarterly, the Company estimates the allowance required using peer group loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. The Company’s historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions due to the Company’s limited loss history. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The Company also considers the results of the external independent loan review when assessing the adequacy of the allowance and incorporates relevant loan review results in the loan impairment and overall adequacy of allowance determinations. Furthermore, regulatory agencies periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to record adjustments to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. Additional considerations are included in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance based on the continuous review conducted by relationship managers and credit department personnel. The Company’s loan policy requires that each customer relationship wherein total exposure exceeds $1.5 million be subject to a formal credit review at least annually. Should these reviews identify potential collection concerns, appropriate adjustments to the allowance may be made. The allowance consists of specific and general components as discussed below. While the allowance consists of separate components, these terms are primarily used to describe a process. Both portions of the allowance are available to provide for inherent losses in the entire portfolio. 70 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Specific Component The specific component relates to loans that are individually determined to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans meeting any of the following criteria are individually evaluated for impairment: risk rated substandard (as defined in Note 4), on non-accrual status or past due greater than 90 days. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral less costs to sell if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Changes to the valuation allowance are recorded as a component of the provision for loan losses. TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. TDRs are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s effective rate at inception. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. General Component The general component of the allowance for loan losses covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Large groups of homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. The general allowance component also includes loans that are individually identified for impairment evaluation but are not considered impaired. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. Due to the Company’s limited loss history, the historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions. The Company utilized a 33 quarter look-back period as of December 31, 2017. Subsequently, the Company increased its look-back period for a total of 37 quarters and 41 quarters as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period was necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. This extension of the historical look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio. The actual loss experience is supplemented with other environmental factors that capture changes in trends, conditions, and other relevant factors that may cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from historical loss experience. The allocation for environmental factors is by nature subjective. These amounts represent estimated probable inherent credit losses, which exist but have not been captured in the historical loss experience. The environmental factors include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans, quality of the loan review system, value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations, and other external factors. Servicing Rights When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in other noninterest income. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. 71 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, su ch as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of t he impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported with other noninterest income on the income statement and the associated asset is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet . The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement within other noninterest income, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal; or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income. Net servicing fees totaled $340,000 and $102,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no servicing fees for the year ended December 31, 2017. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method based on the shorter of the asset lives or the expected lease terms. Useful lives for premises and equipment range from one to thirty-nine years. These assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)), which requires for all operating leases the recognition of a right-of-use (""ROU"") asset and a corresponding lease liability, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For short term leases (term of 12 months or less), a lessee is permitted to make an accounting election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The lease cost will be allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. There were further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01, “Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842” in January 2018. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, ""Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements"", which provides for the option to apply the new leasing standard to all open leases as of the adoption date, on a prospective basis. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting standard ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and all the related amendments (""new lease standard"", ""ASC 842"" or ""ASU 2016-02"") utilizing the practical expedient to apply the new lease standard as of January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis. The Company also elected the ""package of expedients"" and elected as an accounting policy to exclude recording ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases that meet the definition of short-term leases. In addition to excluding short-term leases, the Company has implemented an accounting policy in which non-lease components are not separated from lease components in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all lease contracts. The Company recognized $12.8 million in ROU assets and $13.4 million in lease liabilities as a result of applying the new lease standard as an adjustment to the opening consolidated balance sheet on January 1, 2019. The ROU assets and lease liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 7—Leases for additional disclosures related to leases. Bank Owned Life Insurance The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Bank owned life insurance is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 72 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase The Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase at a specified future date. Such repurchase agreements are considered financing arrangements and, accordingly, the obligation to repurchase assets sold is reflected as a liability in the balance sheets of the Bank. Repurchase agreements are collateralized by debt securities which are owned and under the control of the Bank and are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected October 31st as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the balance sheet. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to ten years. Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned (“OREO”) includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and are recorded at estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Valuation adjustments required at foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, additional losses resulting from the periodic revaluation of the property are charged to other real estate expense. Costs of operating and maintaining the properties and any gains or losses recognized on disposition are also included in other real estate expense. Improvements made to properties are capitalized if the expenditures are expected to be recovered upon the sale of the properties. Restricted Equity Securities The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on an assessment of the ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System, and as such, holds stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“Federal Reserve Bank”). Federal Reserve Bank stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as interest income. Income Taxes Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company’s tax returns remain open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS and various states for the years ended December 31, 2016 through 2019. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 73 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Stock-Ba sed Compensation Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest, reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with performance vesting criteria, anticipated performance is projected to determine the number of awards expected to vest, and the corresponding aggregate expense is adjusted to reflect the elapsed portion of the performance period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $370,000, $383,000 and $310,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively and is included in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance-sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received. Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps (“swaps”) to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these arrangements to meet customer needs, the Bank enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize risk to the Bank. These swaps are derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments. The Bank may also utilize forward starting cash flow hedges to manage its future interest rate exposure. These derivative contracts are designated as hedges and, as such, changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Bank prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges. The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness, along with support for management’s assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion, if any, would be recognized in current period earnings. The Bank discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended. When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as non-interest income. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. Cash flows resulting from the derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as hedges are classified in the cash flow statement in the same category as the cash flows of the items being hedged. 74 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments to fund mortgage loans “ interest rate locks ” to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the sale of mortgage-backed securities are accounted for as free standing derivatives. The fair value of the interest rate lock is recorded at the time the commitment to fund the mortgage lo an is executed and is adjusted for the expected exercise of the commitment before the loan is funded. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the interest rate on the loan is locked. The Company enters into forward commitments for the sale of mortgage-backed securities when interest rate locks are entered into, in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. Changes in the fair values o f these derivatives are included in mortgage banking income . Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on securities transferred to held to maturity and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges which are also recognized as separate components of equity. The Bank’s policy is to release the income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when the item is realized. Fair Value Measurements Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Restriction on Cash Balances Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Act requires that banks maintain reserve balances with their applicable Federal Reserve Bank based principally on the type and amount of their deposits. The Bank was required to have a reserve balance of $73,444,000, $63,890,000, and $43,940,000 at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The reserve balance that the Bank must maintain at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is included in interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure through March __, 2020, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Income Per Common Share Basic net income per share available to common stockholders (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is attributable to convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of outstanding convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. No antidilutive stock options were excluded from calculation for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or December 31, 2017. 75 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following is a summary of the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation for each of the following years (in thousands except share data): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Basic net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 22,422 $ 9,655 $ 1,501 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 17,886,164 13,277,614 11,280,580 Basic net income per share $ 1.25 $ 0.73 $ 0.13 Diluted net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 22,422 $ 9,655 $ 1,501 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 17,886,164 13,277,614 11,280,580 Dilutive shares contingently issuable 727,060 1,202,733 1,522,931 Average diluted common shares outstanding 18,613,224 14,480,347 12,803,511 Diluted net income per share $ 1.20 $ 0.67 $ 0.12 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance was effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company applied the guidance using a modified retrospective approach. The Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income. The scope of the guidance explicitly excludes net interest income as well as many other revenues for financial assets and liabilities including loans, leases, securities, and derivatives. Accordingly, the majority of our revenues will not be affected. The Company performed an assessment of our revenue contracts related to revenue streams that are within the scope of the standard. Our accounting policies did not change materially since the principles of revenue recognition from the ASU were largely consistent with existing guidance and current practices applied by our businesses. We did not identify material changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The Company records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic 606”). Under Topic 606, the Company must identify the contract with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Significant revenue has not been recognized in the current reporting period that results from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. The Company’s primary sources of revenue are derived from interest and dividends earned on loans, investment securities, and other financial instruments that are not within the scope of Topic 606. The Company evaluated the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income was not necessary. The Company generally fully satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are rendered and the transaction prices are typically fixed; charged either on a periodic basis or based on activity. Our accounting policies did not change materially since the principles of revenue recognition from the Accounting Standards Update were largely consistent with existing guidance and current practices applied by our business. 76 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements A description of the Company’s revenue streams accounted for under Topic 606 follows: Treasury management and other deposit service charges: The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction based fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer’s request. Account maintenance fees are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies its performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer’s account balance. Interchange income: Included in other noninterest income are interchange fees, which the Company earns from debit cardholder transactions conducted through various payment networks. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing series provided to the cardholder. Gains/Losses on Sales of OREO: The Company records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Company finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Company assesses whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligation under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company adjusts the transaction price and related gain (loss) on sale if a significant financing component is present. ASU 2016-02, Leases In February 2016, the FASB amended the Leases topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to revise certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing transactions. The amendments were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method and practical expedients for transition. The practical expedients allow the Company to largely account for our existing leases consistent with current guidance except for the incremental balance sheet recognition for lessees. The Company evaluated the new guidance and its impact on the Company’s financial statements. Based on leases outstanding at December 31, 2018, the impact of adoption on January 1, 2019 was recording a lease liability of approximately $13.4 million, a right-of-use asset of approximately $12.8 million, and elimination of deferred rent of approximately $0.6 million. ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities. The amendments were originally supposed to be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for all organizations for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. However, in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates , which finalizes effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and certain smaller reporting companies applying the credit losses standard. The Company has elected to delay implementation of the new standard until 2023. ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB amended the Goodwill and Other Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment for public business entities and other entities that have goodwill reported in their financial statements and have not elected the private company alternative for the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The amendment removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The effective date and transition requirements for the technical corrections will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. 77 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities In August 2017, the FASB amended the requirements of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments were effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted this standard December 1, 2017. There was no material effect on the financial statements. ASU 2018-02, Income Statement: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2018, the FASB Issued (2018-02), Income Statement (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which allows Companies to reclassify the stranded effects in other comprehensive income to retained earnings as a result of the change in the tax rates under the Tax Reform Act. The Company opted to early adopt this pronouncement on December 31, 2017, by retrospective application to each period in which the effect of the change in the tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. The Company made an election to reclassify income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act, amounting to approximately $259,000, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The impact of the reclassification from other comprehensive income to retained earnings is included in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity. ASU 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation In June 2018, the FASB amended the Compensation—Stock Compensation Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The guidance was effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. There was no material effect on the financial statements. ASU 2019-04 ― Applicable to entities that hold financial instruments: In April 2019, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to the recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging, and recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The amendments related to credit losses will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments related to hedging were effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments related to recognition and measurement of financial instruments will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. ASU 2019-05 ― Applicable to entities that hold financial instruments: In May 2019, the FASB issued guidance to provide entities with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments will be effective for the Company upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 in fiscal year 2023. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. ASU 2019-12 ― Applicable to entities within the scope of Topic 740, Income Taxes: In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing specific technical exceptions that often produce information investors have a hard time understanding. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. NOTE 2 – ACQUISITIONS On October 1, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Athens Bancshares Company (“Athens”), the bank holding company for Athens Federal Community Bank, National Association (“Athens Federal”). Under the terms of the acquisition, Athens common shareholders received 2.864 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of Athens common stock. With the acquisition, the Company further expanded its franchise into the East Tennessee market. Athens’ results of operations were included in the Company’s results beginning October 1, 2018. Acquisition related costs of $9,803,000 are included in the Company’s income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018. The fair value of the common shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Athens was determined by the closing price of the Company’s common shares immediately preceding the acquisition date. 78 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill of $31,291,000 arising from the acquisition consisted largely of synergies and the cost savings resulting from the combining of the operations of the companies. Goodwill associated with the Athens acquisition is not amortizable for book or tax purposes. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Ath ens and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date (in thousands): As recorded by Athens Bancshares Initial fair value adjustments Measurement period adjustments As recorded by CapStar Financial Holdings Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,053 $ — $ — $ 12,053 Securities 67,342 84 (a) — 67,426 Loans, gross 349,597 (4,764 ) (b) — 344,833 Allowance for loan losses (4,039 ) 4,039 (c) — — Premises and equipment, net 7,637 1,571 (d) — 9,208 Core deposit intangible 2,758 6,222 (e) — 8,980 Other 29,566 944 (f) — 30,510 Total $ 464,914 $ 8,096 $ — $ 473,010 Liabilities: Deposits $ 404,027 $ 493 (g) $ — $ 404,520 Other 5,363 1,500 (h) — 6,863 Total $ 409,390 $ 1,993 $ — $ 411,383 Net identifiable assets acquired $ 61,627 Total cost of acquisition: Value of stock issued $ 86,538 Value of rolled stock options 6,380 Total cost of acquisition $ 92,918 $ 92,918 Goodwill recorded related to acquisition $ 31,291 (a) The amount represents the fair value adjustment of securities that were subsequently sold. (b) The amount represents the adjustment of the net book value of Athens’ loans to their estimated fair value based on interest rates and expected cash flows at the date of acquisition. (c) The amount represents the removal of Athens’ existing allowance for loan losses. (d) The amount represents the adjustment of the net book value of Athens’ premises and equipment to their estimated fair value. (e) The amount represents the net adjustment of removing Athens’ existing core deposit intangible from prior acquisitions and recording the fair value of the core deposit intangible representing the intangible value of the deposit base acquired and the fair value of the customer relationship. (f) The amount represents the net adjustment of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights acquired and the deferred tax asset recognized on the fair value adjustments on Athens acquired assets and assumed liabilities. (g) The amount represents the adjustment necessary because the weighted average interest rate of Athens’ time deposits exceeded the cost of similar funding at the time of acquisition. The fair value adjustment will be amortized to reduce future interest expense over the life of the portfolio. (h) The amount represents the liability assumed in connection with the merger agreement whereby the Company will make a $1,500,000 charitable contribution to the Athens Foundation over a three year period. 79 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of the Company and Athens as if th e acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2017, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of the core deposit intangible, and related income tax effects.

The transfers of the securities into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category were made at fair value at the date of transfer. The unrealized holding loss at the date of the transfer continues to be reported in a separate component of shareholders’ equity and is being amortized over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of the premiums and discounts. During the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately $41,665,000 of held to maturity securities were transferred to the available for sale category. The Company was able to make the transfer due to early adoption of ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The transfers of the securities into the available for sale category from the held to maturity category were made at fair value at the date of transfer. 80 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The amortized cost and fair value of debt and equity securities at December 31, 2019 , by contractual maturity, are shown below (in thousands). Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Securities with a market value of $70,350,000 and $171,542,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were pledged to collateralize public deposits, derivative positions and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of shareholders’ equity.

The amount of the impairment of available for sale securities related to other fac tors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condit ion and near-term prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The unrealized losses shown above are primarily due to increases i n market rates over the yields available at the time of purchase of the underlying securities and not credit quality. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2019 . There were no other-than-temporary impairments for the years end ed December 31, 2019 , 2018 or 2017 . NOTE 4 – LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES Loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Commercial real estate $ 559,899 $ 550,446 Consumer real estate 256,097 253,562 Construction and land development 143,111 174,670 Commercial and industrial 394,408 404,600 Consumer 28,426 25,615 Other 38,161 20,901 Total 1,420,102 1,429,794 Allowance for loan losses (12,604 ) (12,113 ) Total loans, net $ 1,407,498 $ 1,417,681 At December 31, 2019, variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $785,329,000 and $634,773,000, respectively. At December 31, 2018, variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $827,491,000 and $602,404,000, respectively. The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes all commercial loans, and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000, individually and assigns each loan a risk rating. This analysis is performed on a continual basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least an annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the loan’s risk rating. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention – A special mention asset possesses deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving of management’s attention. If uncorrected, such weaknesses or deficiencies may expose the Company to an increased risk of loss in the future. Substandard – A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. Doubtful – A doubtful asset has all weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is extremely high, but certain important and reasonable specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset exist, therefore, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. 82 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Loans not falling into the criteria above are considered to be pass-rated loans.

This revaluation resulted in a $3.6 million decrease in net deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Significant items that gave rise to deferred taxes at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 2,935 $ 2,795 Net operating loss carryforward 738 2,002 Organization and preopening costs 359 457 Stock-based compensation 200 835 Acquired loans 871 1,319 Unrealized loss on securities available-for-sale — 845 Accrued contributions 247 207 Other 189 685 Deferred tax assets 5,539 9,145 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation 804 645 Goodwill 154 81 Unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale 833 — Amortization of core deposit intangible 1,052 1,398 Other 568 411 Deferred tax liabilities 3,411 2,535 Net deferred tax asset $ 2,128 $ 6,610 At December 31, 2019, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3,011,000, which expire at various dates from 2030 to 2032. Deferred tax assets are fully recognized because the benefits are more likely than not to be realized based on management’s estimation of future taxable earnings. There were no significant unrecognized income tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for instruments that are included in the balance sheet. The following table sets forth outstanding financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): Contract or notional amount December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 672,933 $ 707,675 Standby letters of credit 9,634 12,273 Total $ 682,567 $ 719,948 The Company is party to litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from such litigation and claims as of December 31, 2019, will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company. 94 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 5 – CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Substantially all of the Company’s loans, commitments, and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Company’s market areas. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4 to the financial statements. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions aggregated $86,000,000 and $89,000,000, respectively, in excess of insured limits. NOTE 16 – REGULATORY MATTERS AND RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the Bank is also subject to the regulatory capital requirements of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory – and possibly additional discretionary – actions by regulators that could, in that event, have a material adverse effect on the institutions’ financial statements. The relevant regulations require the Company and the Bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting principles. The capital classifications of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by their regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Those qualitative judgments could also affect the capital status of the Company and the Bank and the amount of dividends the Company and the Bank may distribute. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Companying Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. Banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of December 31, 2019, the Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, federal banking regulators have established five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company and the Bank were well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Company’s or the Bank’s category. 95 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Com pany’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table ( dollars in thousands): Actual Minimum capital requirement (1) Minimum to be well-capitalized (2) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio At December 31, 2019: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 237,857 13.45 % $ 141,436 8.0 % N/A N/A CapStar Bank 224,443 12.70 141,388 8.0 176,735 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 225,074 12.73 106,077 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 211,660 11.98 106,041 6.0 141,388 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 225,074 12.73 79,558 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 195,160 11.04 79,531 4.5 114,878 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 225,074 11.37 79,201 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 211,660 10.70 79,150 4.0 98,938 5.0 At December 31, 2018: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 222,030 12.84 % $ 138,336 8.0 % N/A N/A CapStar Bank 201,972 11.68 138,294 8.0 172,868 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 209,738 12.13 103,752 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 189,680 10.97 103,721 6.0 138,294 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 200,738 11.61 77,814 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 173,180 10.02 77,791 4.5 112,364 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 209,738 11.06 75,867 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 189,680 10.01 75,828 4.0 94,785 5.0 (1) For the calendar year 2019, the Company was required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of Tier 1 common equity capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 1.875% to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees. (2) For the Company to be well-capitalized, the Bank must be well-capitalized and the Company must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Under Tennessee banking law, the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions is limited to the current year’s net income, combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. The Bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that Company holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Based on these regulations, the Bank was eligible to pay $35.8 million and $22.2 million of dividends as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Bank paid the Company $3.5 million of dividends during 2019 and this amount was paid out to shareholders by the Company during 2019. 96 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 7 – NONVOTING AND SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCK WARRANTS Nonvoting Common Stock The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of its common stock as nonvoting common stock. The nonvoting common stock has the same rights and privileges as the common stock other than the nonvoting designation. Under certain conditions, as outlined in the Company’s charter, the nonvoting stock may be converted, on a one-to-one basis, to common stock. In conjunction with the Company’s initial public offering, 79,166 shares of nonvoting common stock were issued and simultaneously converted to common stock on a one-to-one basis as further described under “Warrants” below. During 2019, 132,561 shares of nonvoting common stock were converted to common stock. As a result, at December 31, 2019, there were no shares of nonvoting common stock outstanding. Preferred Stock In conjunction with its initial capital issuance in 2008, the Bank issued 1,609,756 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to certain shareholders. During 2016, coinciding with the Company’s initial public offering, 731,707 preferred shares were converted to common shares. During 2019, 878,048 preferred shares were converted to common shares. As a result, at December 31, 2019, there was no Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. Warrants In conjunction with the issuance of the 1,609,756 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of such stock were issued 500,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s nonvoting common stock at a purchase price of $10.25 per share. The warrants were exercisable at any time and expired ten years from the date of grant of July 14, 2008. As of December 31, 2019, all of these warrants have been exercised and none of these warrants remain outstanding. As part of the initial capital issuance in 2008, each organizer of the Company (“Organizers”) who became a director of the Company received a warrant to purchase, at the purchase price of $10.00 per share, 10,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. These warrants were issued in compliance with the FDIC’s policy on noncash compensation in recognition of the Organizers considerable contribution of time, expertise, and capital. The Company issued warrants to purchase 60,000 shares of common stock to these organizers. The warrants expired ten years from date of grant of July 14, 2008. As of December 31, 2019, all of these warrants have been exercised and no warrants remain outstanding. In addition, each subscriber for shares who is a Tennessee resident or any entity controlled by a Tennessee resident and invested a minimum of $500,000 in the offering, received a warrant to purchase additional shares of common stock equal to 5% of accepted subscriptions at the purchase price of $10.00 per share. The Company issued warrants to purchase 238,319 shares of common stock to these subscribers. The warrants expired ten years from date of grant of July 14, 2008. As of December 31, 2019, all of these warrants have been exercised and no warrants remain outstanding. NOTE 18 – SHAREHOLDERS’ AGREEMENT On August 22, 2016, the Company entered into the S econd Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement (the “SARSA”) with certain of its shareholders. Other than with respect to registration rights and rights and obligations with respect to indemnification, the SARSA will remain in effect until June 30, 2018 unless earlier terminated by the shareholders that are party to the SARSA. Among other matters, the SARSA (i) permits Corsair III Financial Services Capital Partners, L.P. and Corsair III Financial Services Offshore 892 Partners, L.P. (the “Corsair Funds”) to recommend one nominee to the Nominating, Governance and Community Affairs Committee of the boards of directors of the Company and our bank for election to such boards, subject to any required regulatory and shareholder approvals, (ii) provides “demand” registration rights to the Corsair Funds and those shareholders, other than the Corsair Funds, that hold, individually or in the aggregate, at least 500,000 shares of registrable securities and (iii) provides “piggyback” registration rights to all shareholders that are parties to the SARSA. Pursuant to the terms of the SARSA, we received a request from certain shareholders party to the SARSA to register 3,652,094 shares of our common stock on a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”) in December 2018. The Registration Statement was filed with the SEC on December 21, 2018. Subsequently, during 2019, the Corsair Funds exited their positions in the Company’s shares. 97 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 9 – STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES During 2008, the board of directors of the Company approved the CapStar Bank 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. Following the formation of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. in 2016, and in connection with the Share Exchange, the outstanding awards of restricted stock and stock options under the CapStar Bank 2008 Stock Incentive Plan were exchanged for similar awards of restricted stock and stock options issued by CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. under the Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which the board of directors adopted in 2016. The Plan provides for the grant of stock-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance awards and restricted stock, to employees, directors and service providers that are subject to forfeiture until vesting conditions have been satisfied by the award recipient under the terms of the award. The Plan is intended to help align the interests of employees and our shareholders and reward our employees for improved Company performance. The Plan reserved 1,569,475 shares of stock for issuance of stock incentives. Stock incentives include both restricted stock and stock option grants. During 2018 the board of directors approved the addition of 400,000 shares of stock for issuance of stock incentives under the Plan. Total shares issuable under the plan were 362,757 at December 31, 2019. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, within salaries and employee benefits for employees, and within other non-interest expense for directors, in the consolidated statements of income as follows (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 1,262 $ 2,079 $ 1,061 Less: deferred tax benefit (330 ) (543 ) (406 ) Reduction of net income $ 932 $ 1,536 $ 655 Restricted Shares Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at the issue date. The recipients have the right to vote and receive dividends but cannot sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber the restricted stock until the shares have vested. Restricted shares fully vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. A summary of the changes in the Company’s nonvested restricted shares for 2019 follows: Weighted Average Restricted Grant Date Nonvested Shares Shares Fair Value Nonvested at beginning of period 157,616 $ 17.00 Granted 31,683 15.86 Vested (83,062 ) 15.93 Forfeited (21,540 ) 17.72 Nonvested at end of period 84,697 $ 17.44 As of December 31, 2019, there was $1,564,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $1,352,000, $2,804,000 and $1,174,000, respectively. Stock Options Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Option awards generally have a three year vesting period and a ten year contractual term. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on calculations performed by management using industry data. The expected term of options granted was calculated using the “simplified” method for plain vanilla options as permitted under authoritative literature. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 98 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted average assumptions as of the grant date . The Company granted 50,000 options during 2019. There were no options granted during 2018 . 2019 Dividend yield 1.35 % Expected term (in years) 6.50 Expected stock price volatility 29.55 % Risk-free interest rate 2.25 % A summary of the activity in stock options for 2019 follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Exercise Contractual Shares Price Term (years) Outstanding at beginning of period 507,903 $ 8.66 Granted 50,000 14.84 Exercised (286,701 ) 7.33 Forfeited or expired — — Outstanding at end of period 271,202 $ 11.22 4.9 Fully vested and expected to vest 271,086 $ 11.22 4.9 Exercisable at end of period 214,952 $ 10.32 3.8 Information related to stock options during 2019, 2018 and 2017 follows: 2019 2018 2017 Intrinsic value of options exercised $ 2,478,086 $ 7,654,738 $ 2,010,536 Cash received from option exercises 1,930,737 6,897,845 2,013,840 Tax benefit realized from option exercises 103,847 846,725 774,056 Weighted average fair value of options granted 5.35 — — As of December 31, 2019, there was $216,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. NOTE 20 – EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain senior executives with various expiration dates. Most of the contracts have an option for annual renewal by mutual agreement. The agreements specify that in certain terminating events the Company will be obligated to provide certain benefits and pay each of the senior executives severance based on their annual salaries. These terminating events include termination of employment without “Cause” (as defined in the agreements) or in certain other circumstances specified in the agreements. NOTE 21 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a Retirement Savings 401(k) Plan in which employees may participate. The Company has elected a safe harbor 401(k) plan and as such is required to make an annual contribution of 3% of the employees’ salaries annually. An employee does not have to contribute to receive the employer contribution. In addition, the Company may make an additional discretionary contribution up to 6% of the employees’ salaries annually. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company contributed $874,000, $639,000 and $550,000, respectively, to the 401(k) Plan. The Company also has a Health Reimbursement Plan in place to offset the cost of healthcare deductibles for employees. At the end of the year, up to one-half of the unused balance in the employee’s account will be available for the following year up to a maximum of the deductible for that employee. 99 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 2 2 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate swap agreements. Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges There were no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2019. A forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $20 million as of December 31, 2018 was designated as a cash flow hedge of certain liabilities and was determined to be fully effective during all periods presented. As such, no amount of ineffectiveness was included in net income. Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was recorded in other liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company terminated the interest rate swap during 2019, which resulted in a termination fee of $1.5 million. Cash flow swaps that have been terminated resulting in cash settlement equal to previously unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and are being amortized to net income over the remaining contractual terms of the swaps. Summary information about the interest-rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Notional amounts $ — $ 20,000 Weighted average pay rates — 3.54 % Weighted average receive rates — 3 month LIBOR Weighted average maturity — 4.5 years Fair value $ — $ (836 ) Amount of unrealized loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax $ — $ (617 ) Pursuant to its interest rate swap agreements, the Company pledged collateral to the counterparties in the form of investment securities with a carrying value of $2,038,000 at December 31, 2018. There was no collateral posted to or from the counterparties as of December 31, 2019. Other Interest Rate Swaps The Company also enters into swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these transactions the Company enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize risk to the Company. A summary of the Company’s customer related interest rate swaps is as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Notional Estimated Notional Estimated amount fair value amount fair value Interest rate swap agreements: Pay fixed/receive variable swaps $ 45,053 $ (926 ) $ 29,126 $ 24 Pay variable/receive fixed swaps 45,053 926 29,126 (24 ) Total $ 90,106 $ — $ 58,252 $ — Mortgage Banking Derivatives The Company enters into various derivative agreements with customers in the form of interest-rate lock commitments which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. The derivatives are valued using a model that utilizes market interest rates and other unobservable inputs. Changes in the fair value of these commitments due to fluctuations in interest rates that are to be originated to our loans held for sale portfolio are economically hedged through the use of forward sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities. The gains and losses arising from this derivative activity are reflected in current period earnings under mortgage banking income. Interest rate lock commitments are valued using a model with significant unobservable market parameters. Forward sale commitments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable. 100 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The net gains (losses) relating to mortgage banking derivative instruments included in mortgage banking income were as follows (dollars in thousan ds): For the year ended December 31, 2019 Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments $ 648 Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments (148 ) Total $ 500 There were no gains or losses relating to mortgage banking derivative instruments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2: Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Investment Securities : The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2), using matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded and values debt securities by relying on quoted prices for the specific securities and the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). See below for additional discussion of Level 3 valuation methodologies and significant inputs. The fair values of all securities are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Derivatives-Interest Rate Swaps : The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). The Company’s derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair values of all interest rate swaps are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Impaired Loans : The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the loan policy. Other Real Estate Owned : Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Appraisals may be adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and/or management’s expertise and knowledge of the collateral. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. The Company had no other real estate owned carried at fair value at December 31, 2019 or 2018. 102 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Loans Held For Sale : Loans held for sale are carried at either fair value, if elected, or the lower of cost or fair value on a pool-level basis. Origination fees and costs for loans held for sale recorded at lower of cost or market are capitalized in the basis of the loan and are included in the calculation of realized gains and losses upon sale. Origination fees and costs are recognized in earnings at the time of origination for loans held for sale that are recorded at fair value. Fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other observable market data, such as outstandi ng commitments from third party investors (Level 2). There were no loans held for sale carried at fair value at December 31, 2018 . Derivatives-Mortgage Loan Interest Rate Lock Commitments : Interest rate lock commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are recorded at fair value, determined as the amount that would be required to settle each derivative instrument at the balance sheet date. The fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is derived from the fair value of related mortgage loans, which is based on observable market data and includes the expected net future cash flows related to servicing of the loans. In estimating the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment, the Company assigns a probability to the interest rate lock commitment based on an expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded (a “pull through” rate). The expected pull through rates are applied to the fair value of the unclosed mortgage pipeline, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e., the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Changes to the fair value of interest rate lock commitments are recognized based on interest rate changes, changes in the probability that the commitment will be exercised, and the passage of time. Derivatives-Mortgage-Backed Securities Forward Sales Commitments : The Company utilizes mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments to hedge mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments. Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments are recorded at fair value based on quoted prices for similar assets in an active market with inputs that are observable, resulting in a Level 2 fair value classification. . Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands): Fair value measurements at December 31, 2019 Quoted prices in active Significant markets for other Significant identical observable unobservable Carrying assets inputs inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Securities available-for-sale: U.S. government-sponsored agencies $ 10,331 $ — $ 10,331 $ — Obligations of states and political subdivisions 45,960 — 45,960 — Mortage-backed securities-residential 138,679 — 138,679 — Asset-backed securities 3,197 — 3,197 — Other debt securities 14,962 — 14,962 — Loans held for sale 168,222 — 168,222 — Derivative assets: Non-hedging derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related 926 — 926 — Mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments 648 — — 648 Liabilities: Derivative liabilities: Non-hedging derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related (926 ) — (926 ) — Mortgage-backed securities forward sales commitments (148 ) — (148 ) — 103 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fair value measurements at December 31, 2018 Quoted prices in active Significant markets for other Significant identical observable unobservable Carrying assets inputs inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Securities available-for-sale: U.S. government-sponsored agencies $ 10,706 $ — $ 10,706 $ — Obligations of states and political subdivisions 61,926 — 61,926 — Mortage-backed securities-residential 144,158 — 144,158 — Asset-backed securities 15,284 — 15,284 — Other debt securities 11,734 — 11,734 — Derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related 494 — 494 — Liabilities: Derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related (494 ) — (494 ) — Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges (836 ) — (836 ) — The table below presents a reconciliation of all assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands): Mortgage Loan Interest Rate Lock Commitments 2019 2018 Balance of recurring Level 3 assets at January 1st $ — $ — Total gains or losses for the period: Included in mortgage banking income 648 — Balance of recurring Level 3 assets at December 31st $ 648 $ — The following table presents quantitative information about recurring Level 3 fair value measurements at December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands).

(b) Federal Funds Sold Federal funds sold clear on a daily basis. For this reason, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. (c) Restricted Equity Securities It is not practical to determine the fair value of restricted securities due to restrictions placed on their transferability. (d) Loans, net In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the fair value of loans is measured using an exit price notion. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models or based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. (e) Accrued interest receivable The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value. (f) Other Assets Included in other assets are bank owned life insurance and certain interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. For bank owned life insurance, the carrying amount is based on the cash surrender value and is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 105 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (g) Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated by discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates with similar remaining maturities. (h) Federal Home Loan Bank Advances The fair value of fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank Advances is estimated using discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates, advances and other borrowings with similar remaining maturities. (i) Other Liabilities Included in other liabilities are accrued interest payable and certain interest rate swap agreements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. (j) Off-Balance Sheet Instruments Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material. (k) Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on estimating on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, fixed assets are not considered financial instruments and their value has not been incorporated into the fair value estimates. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in 2013. This assessment included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. Based on the assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “aspire,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “projection,” “forecast,” “roadmap,” “goal,” “target,” “would,” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based upon current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. The inclusion of these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that such expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and that are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date of this Report, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: The acceptance by customers of Athens of the Company’s products and services; the ability of the Company to meet expectations regarding the benefits, costs, synergies and financial and operational impact of the Athens merger; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits, costs, synergies and financial and operational improvements of the Athens merger will not be realized or will not be realized as expected; the possibility that the Athens merger integration will be more expensive or take more time to complete than anticipated; the opportunities to enhance market share in certain markets and the acceptance of the Company generally in new markets; economic conditions (including interest rate environment, government economic and monetary policies, the strength of global financial markets and inflation and deflation) that impact the financial services industry as a whole and/or our business; the concentration of our business in our Target Market and the effect of changes in the economic, political and environmental conditions on this market; increased competition in the financial services industry, locally, regionally or nationally, which may adversely affect pricing and the other terms offered to our clients; an increase in the cost of deposits, loss of deposits or a change in the deposit mix, which could increase our cost of funding; an increase in the costs of capital, which could negatively affect our ability to borrow funds, successfully raise additional capital or participate in strategic acquisition opportunities; our dependence on our management team and board of directors and changes in our management and board composition; our reputation in the community; our ability to execute our strategy to achieve our loan, ROAA and efficiency ratio goals, hire seasoned bankers, and achieve deposit growth through organic growth and strategic acquisitions; credit risks related to the size of our borrowers and our ability to adequately identify, assess and limit our credit risk; our concentration of large loans to a small number of borrowers as well as to borrowers located within our Target Market; the significant portion of our loan portfolio that originated during the past two years and therefore may less reliably predict future collectability than older loans; the adequacy of reserves (including our allowance for loan losses) and the appropriateness of our methodology for calculating such reserves; non-performing loans and leases; non-performing assets; charge-offs, non-accruals, troubled debt restructurings, impairments and other credit-related issues; adverse trends in the healthcare service industry, which is an integral component of our market’s economy; our management of risks inherent in our commercial real estate loan portfolio, and the risk of a prolonged downturn in the real estate market, which could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell collateral upon any foreclosure; governmental legislation and regulation, including changes in the nature and timing of the adoption and effectiveness ii of new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as amended, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as amended, Basel guidelines, capital requirements, accounting regulation or standards and other applicable laws and regulations; the loss of large depositor relationships, which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources; operational and liquidity risks associated with our business, including liquidity risks inherent in correspondent banking; volatility in interest rates and our overall management of interest rate risk, including managing the sensitivity of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to interest rates, and the impact to our earnings from a change in interest rates; the potential for our Bank’s regulatory lending limits and other factors related to our size to restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy; strategic acquisitions we may undertake to achieve our goals; the sufficiency of our capital, including sources of capital and the extent to which we may be required to raise additional capital to meet our goals; fluctuations in the fair value of our investment securities that are beyond our control; deterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. government and downgrades in Treasury and federal agency securities; potential exposure to fraud, negligence, computer theft and cyber-crime; the adequacy of our risk management framework; our dependence on our information technology and telecommunications systems and the potential for any systems failures or interruptions; threats to and breaches of our information technology systems and data security, including cyber attacks; our dependence upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data; our ability to adapt to technological change; the financial soundness of other financial institutions; our exposure to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities; our engagement in derivative transactions; our involvement from time to time in legal proceedings and examinations and remedial actions by regulators; our involvement from time to time in litigation or other proceedings instituted by or against shareholders, customers, employees or third parties and the cost of legal fees associated with such litigation or proceedings; the susceptibility of our market to natural disasters and acts of God; and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to remediate any future material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Risk Factors” included in this Report. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Report, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict their occurrence or how they will affect us .

BUSINESS OVERVIEW CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc., a Tennessee corporation, is a bank holding company that is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee and that operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, a Tennessee-chartered state bank. CapStar Bank was incorporated in the State of Tennessee in 2007 and acquired a state charter in 2008 which was accomplished through a de novo application with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (“TDFI”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Upon approval of its charter, CapStar Bank opened for business to the public on July 14, 2008. CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in 2015 and, on February 5, 2016, completed a share exchange with CapStar Bank’s shareholders that resulted in CapStar Bank becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We are a bank that seeks to establish and maintain comprehensive relationships with our clients by delivering customized and creative banking solutions and superior client service. Our products and services include (i) commercial and industrial loans to small and medium sized businesses, with a particular focus on businesses operating in the healthcare industry, (ii) commercial real estate loans, (iii) private banking and wealth management services for the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals; (iv) correspondent banking services to meet the needs of Tennessee’s smaller community banks and (v) various retail and consumer products. Our operations are presently concentrated in Tennessee. As of December 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $2.0 billion, total deposits of $1.6 billion, total net loans of $1.4 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $254 million. Core Operating Principles We operate our business in conformity with our core principles which are, in order of priority: • Soundness - We strive to engage in safe and sound banking practices that preserve the asset quality of our balance sheet and protect our deposit base and ensure we maintain capital levels that are considered above “well capitalized” according to regulatory standards. • Profitability - We continuously seek to improve our core profits by growing our revenue faster than our expenses in order to increase net income and improve our profitability metrics. • Strategic Growth - We seek to grow our total loans and deposits by leveraging our operating platform to facilitate organic and acquisitive growth. We have historically adhered to these core operating principles, and we intend to continue to emphasize the importance of these principles to the conduct of our business. Acquisitions On July 31, 2012, our bank completed its acquisition of American Security, a Tennessee banking corporation headquartered in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Our bank acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of American Security for approximately $15.2 million in total consideration which was comprised of the issuance of approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock of our bank. At the time of the acquisition, American Security had two banking locations located in Sumner County, Tennessee. The operations of American Security are included in CapStar Bank’s financial statements beginning on July 31, 2012. On February 3, 2014, CapStar Bank completed its acquisition of Farmington Financial Group, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Farmington primarily originates residential real estate loans that are sold in the secondary market. The bank acquired all the assets and liabilities of Farmington for approximately $6.4 million in total consideration which was comprised of $3.0 million in cash, 100,000 shares of common stock of our bank and a five year earn-out based on pre-tax income. The operations of Farmington are included in CapStar Bank’s financial statements beginning on February 3, 2014. 1 On October 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Athens Bancshares Corporation (“Athens”), the bank holding company for Athens Federal Community Bank, National Association (“Athens Federal”), headquartered in Athens, Tennessee. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Athens for approximately $92.9 million in total consideration which was primarily comprised of the issuance of approximately 5.2 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of the acquisition, Athens Federal had eight banking locations located throughout the Eastern Tennessee corridor between Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee. The operations of Athens are included in our financial statements beginning October 1, 2018. Our Products and Services Loans General. Through our bank, we offer a broad range of commercial lending products to small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals. Our strategy is to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio in terms of the type of loan product, the type of client and the industries in which our business clients are engaged. Our commercial and industrial lending products include commercial loans, business term loans, equipment financing and lines of credit to a diversified mix of small and medium sized businesses. We offer commercial real estate loans that are collateralized by both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties, as well as interim construction loans. As a general practice, we originate substantially all of our loans, and we limit the amount of participations we purchase to loans originated by lead banks with which we have a close relationship and which share our credit philosophies. Our consumer lending products include residential first mortgage loans which are typically thereafter sold on the secondary market. We offer second mortgage home equity mortgage loans and other consumer related loans such as loans for automobile or other recreational vehicles, which we maintain on the Bank’s balance sheet. Additionally, we offer lines of credit to facilitate investment opportunities for consumer clients whose financial characteristics support the request. We market our lending products and services to existing clients through our client service. We seek to attract new lending clients through customized and creative lending solutions and competitive pricing. We have banking teams that are specifically dedicated to our lines of business, including a team that is dedicated to the healthcare sector. We believe our industry-specific knowledge, product and local market expertise and engagement increase our profile within these lending verticals, enable us to identify, select and compete for qualified borrowers and attractive financing projects and manage more effectively the potential risks of our loan portfolio. Underwriting. Disciplined underwriting is the foundation of our credit culture. We strive to adhere to thorough underwriting standards and deliver customized and creative loan solutions in a responsive and timely manner. Philosophically, we seek loans that are prudent and desirable, not just “doable.” In considering a loan, we follow the underwriting principles in our loan and credit administration policies which include the following requirements: • receipt of certain financial information, such as financial statements, tax returns and credit reports, to ensure that the potential borrower has sufficient recurring cash flow and liquidity to repay the loan; • determination that the structure of the loan matches the underlying purpose of and repayment source for the loan, the potential borrower’s creditworthiness and the depreciable life of any collateral; • verification that the potential borrower has a demonstrated propensity to repay the loan/the borrower’s indebtedness/etc.; • consideration of the value, liquidity and marketability of the potential borrower’s assets and identifying and evaluating all significant direct and contingent liabilities; and • determination and approval by the bank’s Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) of the rates and fees associated with the potential loan. Except in very limited circumstances in which substantial equity is present, our commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are supported by personal guaranties from the principals of the borrower. In addition, we require our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans to be secured by well- managed income producing property with adequate margins, supported by a history of profitable operations and cash flows, and proven operating stability. 2 Our underwriting processes collaboratively engage our bankers, credit underwriters and portfolio managers in the analysis of each loan request. We manage our credit risks by analyzing metrics related to our lines of business in order to maintain a conservative and well-diversified loan portfolio reflective of our assessment of various subsets within these lines of business. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ tiered review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. Concentrations. We are a relationship-oriented, rather than a transaction-based, lender. Accordingly, substantially all of our loans have been made to borrowers located in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 93% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market, and a substantial portion of those loans are considered commercial and industrial loans (including loans to businesses operating in the healthcare industry), commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied and non-owner occupied real estate), mortgage loans and construction loans. As such, a substantial majority of our loan portfolio is dependent upon the economic environment of our Target Market. We do have a limited number of loans secured by properties located outside of Tennessee, most of which are made to borrowers who are well-known to us because they are headquartered or reside within Tennessee. In addition, we employ appropriate limits on our overall loan portfolio and requirements with respect to certain types of lending. As a general practice, we operate with an internal guideline limiting loans to any single borrowing relationship to a tiered amount based upon our internal risk rating. Many of our loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2018, our 25 largest borrowing relationships (which may include multiple loans to one borrower or loans to multiple entities that are affiliated due to common ownership) accounted for approximately 18% of our total loan portfolio. Credit Risk Management. Managing credit risk is a process that involves the entire Company. Our strategy for credit risk management includes the disciplined underwriting process described above, adherence to prudent standards, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all loan exposures. Our Chief Credit Officer provides bank-wide credit oversight and regularly reviews the loan portfolio to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. We periodically submit ourselves to review by independent third parties to validate our internal oversight. We strive to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans become delinquent or impaired, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Credit risk management involves a partnership between our lenders and our credit administration group with credit approval processes requiring concurrence of the two. The members of our credit administration group primarily focus their efforts on credit analysis, underwriting and monitoring new credits and providing management reporting to executive management and our board of directors. Based upon size, emerging problem loans are assigned to our Special Assets Group to mitigate the risk of loss. Executive management regularly reviews the status of the watch list and classified assets portfolio as well as the larger credits in the portfolio. Our Special Assets Group is also responsible for managing the collection and foreclosure process and the disposal of other real estate owned. Deposits Core deposits are our principal source of funds for use in lending and other general banking purposes. We solicit core deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through relationship-focused marketing. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, time and savings deposits, certificates of deposit and CDARS ® reciprocal products. Other than deposits obtained through the CDARS program, we do not rely on brokered deposits as a meaningful source of funding. Our ability to gather deposits is an important aspect of our business franchise, and we believe this is a significant driver of our success. Our largest source of deposits is money market and savings accounts. Our transaction accounts include checking and NOW accounts, which provide us with a source of fee income, as well as a low-cost source of funds. Time accounts also provide us with a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. Certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 are held primarily by clients in our Target Market. Deposit rates are reviewed regularly by senior management as we continuously seek to price our deposit products and services competitively to promote core deposit growth. Our management believes that the rates that we offer are competitive with those offered by other institutions in our Target Market. 3 Correspondent Banking We provide correspondent banking services to community banks located in Tennessee. Services we offer include settlement, Fed Funds lines of credit, depository products, wire transfer services, bank holding company loans and loan participations on larger commercial and commercial real estate exposures. Correspondent banking loans and deposits comprised approximately $9.8 million of our total loans and $152.0 million of our total deposits as of December 31, 2018. We include the amount of total loans and total deposits from our correspondent banking line of business in the amounts of our total loans and total deposits for our commercial and industrial line of business. Loans made to community banks operating in the correspondent banking line of business comprised 2% of commercial and industrial loans as of December 31, 2018. Deposits from community banks operating in the correspondent banking line of business comprised 10% of total deposits as of December 31, 2018. Correspondent banking provides a valuable funding source for the bank. In 2013, management identified a void in the Tennessee correspondent banking market due to the instability of larger correspondent banks. Other factors leading to the expansion of correspondent banking included a need to diversify our funding base, the desire by many community banks to do business with a Tennessee-based correspondent bank, the ability to recruit well-known and respected talent for business development and risk management, and the ability to license a low cost proprietary settlement platform. Mortgage Banking Our mortgage banking line of business generated $407.8 million in mortgage loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2018. Mortgage loans are typically sold in the secondary market and are underwritten by the investor. This line of business has provided the bank a source of noninterest income and referrals for other banking services including home equity lines of credit and deposit products. Other Services Given client demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour telephone and online banking, direct deposit, mobile banking, safe deposit boxes, remote deposit and cash management services for individuals and small and medium sized business. We also participate in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers are able to use throughout Tennessee and other regions. In many cases, we reimburse our customer for any ATM fees that may be charged to the customer. Competition The financial services industry is highly competitive in our Target Market. In particular, the Nashville MSA banking market consisted of 63 financial institutions with over $61 billion in deposits as of June 30, 2018. We held the number 13 deposit market share position at June 30, 2018 with 1.9% of the deposit market share. We compete for loans, deposits, and financial services in our Target Market. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area, Internet-based banks, out-of-market banks, and bank holding companies that advertise in or otherwise serve our market area, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. We believe that our experienced leadership, efficient and scalable operating model, personalized service and emphasis on attracting core deposits from our other product offerings enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which we operate. 4 Information and Technology We continually adapt to the changing technological needs and wants of our clients by investing in our electronic banking platform. We use a combination of online and mobile banking channels to attract and retain clients and expand the convenience of banking with us. In most cases, our clients can initiate banking transactions from the convenience of their personal computer or smart phone, reducing the number of in-branch visits necessary to conduct routine banking transactions. The remote transactions available to our clients include remote image deposit, bill payment, external and internal transfers, ACH origination and wire transfer. We believe that our investments in technology and innovation are consistent with our clients’ needs and will support future migration of our clients’ transactions to these and other developing electronic banking channels. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we had 295 total employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance and that of our subsidiaries may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the TDFI, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitization and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results and those of our bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of insured banks, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and enter into acquisitions with other companies, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and our bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. 5 Bank Holding Company Regulation Since we own all of the capital stock of our bank, we are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Acquisition of Banks The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before: • acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will, directly or indirectly, own or control 5% or more of the bank’s voting shares; • acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or • merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of the above transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources includes a focus on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section titled “Item 1. Business—Regulation and Supervision—Capital Adequacy.” The Federal Reserve also considers the effectiveness of the institutions in combating money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering program of the acquiring bank holding company and the anti-money laundering compliance records of a bank to be acquired as part of the transaction. Finally, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration the extent to which the proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Under the BHC Act, if well-capitalized and well-managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. In each case, however, state law may place restrictions on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for at least three years. Change in Bank Control Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute acquisition of “control” of the bank holding company if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the transaction or the bank holding company has registered securities under the Exchange Act. In addition, any person or group of persons acting in concert must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25% (or 5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, the right to control in any manner the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the bank holding company. Permitted Activities Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities: • banking or managing or controlling banks; and • any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 6 Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include: • factoring accounts receivable; • making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities in connection with the foregoing; • leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; • operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; • engaging in trust company functions in a manner authorized by state law; • financial and investment advisory activities; • discount securities brokerage activities; • underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; • providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; • performing selected data processing services and support services; • acting as an agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and • performing selected insurance underwriting activities. The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. Support of Subsidiary Institutions The Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. As a result of a bank holding company’s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank. Repurchase or Redemption of Securities A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions. Bank Regulation and Supervision Our bank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of the operations of our bank. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the safety and soundness of our bank and our bank’s depositors, rather than our shareholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to our bank. 7 Since our bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the state of Tennessee and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI regularly examine our bank’s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Our bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. Our bank is also subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations. Branching Under current Tennessee law, our bank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of, or prior notice to, the TDFI and the Federal Reserve. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, our bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Tennessee. Under federal law, our bank may establish branch offices with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. While prior law imposed various limits on the ability of banks to establish new branches in states other than their home state, the Dodd-Frank Act allows a bank to branch into a new state by setting up a new branch if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. This makes it much simpler for banks to open de novo branches in other states. FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the FDIC assigns an institution to a risk category based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations, which are designed to measure risk. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC. In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a federal government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2019. Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our bank’s record of performance under the CRA is publicly available. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. At December 31, 2018 the Bank had a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” Interest Rate Limitations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by our bank are subject to applicable state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. 8 Federal Laws Applicable to Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions Our bank’s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including: • the Federal Truth in Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; • the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves; • the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or certain other prohibited factors in all aspects of credit transactions; • the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; • the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by debt collectors; • the Service Members Civil Relief Act, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in military service; • the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, governing the disclosure and safeguarding of sensitive non-public personal information of our clients; • the Right to Financial Privacy Act, imposing a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; • the Electronic Funds Transfer Act governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and clients’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and • the rules and regulations of the CFPB and various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. Capital Adequacy In July 2013, the federal banking regulators, in response to the statutory requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, adopted regulations implementing the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord, or Basel III, which had been approved by the Basel member central bank governors in 2010 as an agreement among the countries’ central banks and bank regulators on the amount of capital banks and their holding companies must maintain as a cushion against losses and insolvency. The U.S. Basel III rule’s minimum capital to risk-weighted assets, or RWA, requirements are a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The rule also changes the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Basel III rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital. 9 Under the U.S. Basel III rule, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016, and the requirements will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. A banking organization also would be prohibited from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework will require us to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios of (i) 7% for common equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5% total capital, once it is fully phased in. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. When the rule is fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action, or PCA, well-capitalized thresholds. Generally, banking organizations of our size became subject to the U.S. Basel III rule on January 1, 2015, while the capital conservation buffer and the deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital will phase in over time. Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a banking institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into which all insured depository institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds and other qualitative requirements for each of those categories. For an insured depository institution to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At December 31, 2018, our bank qualified for the well capitalized category. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with Federal Reserve approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. 10 Liquidity Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. This scrutiny has increased during recent years, as the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s negatively affected the liquidity of many financial institutions. Various bank regulatory publications, including Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management) and FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-84-2008 (Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions. Any increased liquidity requirements applied to us or our bank generally would be expected to cause us or our bank to invest assets more conservatively—and therefore at lower yields—than we and our bank otherwise might invest. Such lower-yield investments likely would reduce our revenue stream, and in turn our earnings potential. Payment of Dividends We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, is dividends our bank pays to us as our bank’s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to our bank’s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our shareholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as such a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Tennessee corporate law which prevents payment of dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our board of directors must consider our and our bank’s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs. The TDFI also regulates our bank’s dividend payments. Under Tennessee law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend without prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (i) the total of its retained net income for that year, plus (ii) its retained net income for the preceding two years. Our bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Our bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of the bank’s transactions with its affiliates. Subject to various exceptions, the total amount of the bank’s transactions with affiliates is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, transactions with affiliates also must meet specified collateral requirements and safety and soundness requirements. Our bank must also comply with provisions prohibiting the acquisition of low-quality assets from an affiliate. Our bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in transactions with affiliates, as well as other types of transactions set forth in Section 23B, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. 11 Our bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions between the bank and third parties, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There are also individual and aggregate limitations on loans to insiders and their related interests. The aggregate amount of insider loans generally cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus. Insiders and banks are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly entering into insider loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Single Borrower Credit Limits Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. Commercial Real Estate Concentration In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal bank agencies issued additional guidance entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.” Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2018, our bank’s total CRE loans represented 301% of its capital. Privacy Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting non-public personal information of their clients. Clients generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing non-public personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. Consumer Credit Reporting The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) imposes, among other things: • requirements for financial institutions to develop policies and procedures to identify potential identity theft and, upon the request of a consumer, to place a fraud alert in the consumer’s credit file stating that the consumer may be the victim of identity theft or other fraud; • requirements for entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies to implement procedures and policies regarding the accuracy and integrity of the furnished information and regarding the correction of previously furnished information that is later determined to be inaccurate; • requirements for mortgage lenders to disclose credit scores to consumers in certain circumstances; and • limitations on the ability of a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate to use that information for marketing purposes. 12 Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation Our bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank has established an anti-money laundering program pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act and customer identification program pursuant to the USA Patriot Act. The bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. Our bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements. Overdraft Fees Federal Reserve Regulation E restricts banks’ abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this new law has significantly changed and is significantly changing the bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on the rules and regulations that implement it. A number of the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this “Supervision and Regulation” section. The following items provide a brief description of certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and our bank. • The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Bureau has examination and enforcement authority with respect to enumerated consumer financial protection laws over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer financial protection laws by their primary bank regulator. • The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. The law created a variety of new consumer protections, including limitations, subject to exceptions, on the manner by which loan originators may be compensated and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower’s “ability to repay” a residential mortgage loan. Final rules implementing these latter statutory requirements became effective in 2014. • The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. • The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (i) requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments; (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (iii) requires national securities exchanges to require listed companies to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers; (iv) authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials; and (v) directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. 13 As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, we expect compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, on February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for his administration to review existing U.S. financial laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act. At this time, it is unclear if this executive order will result in any material changes to current laws and regulations applicable to us. The Volcker Rule On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted a final rule implementing the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act and prohibits “banking entities” from engaging in “proprietary trading.” Banking entities also are prohibited from sponsoring or investing in private equity or hedge funds, or extending credit to or engaging in other covered transactions with affiliated private equity or hedge funds. The fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule generally apply to banking entities of any size, including us, the bank and any other “affiliate” under the BHC Act. Limitations on Incentive Compensation In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and our bank, the proposal would impose principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions would be prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal would also impose certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. The Federal Reserve would reserve the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. We are evaluating the expected impact of the proposal on our business. U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) was enacted into law. The Tax Reform Act provides for significant changes to the U.S. tax code that impact businesses. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Reform Act reduced the U.S. federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% for U.S. taxable income and required a one-time remeasurement of deferred taxes to reflect their value at a lower tax rate of 21%. The Tax Reform Act included other changes, including, but not limited to, a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses, elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, additional limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we recorded a $3.56 million increase in income tax expense for 2017.

RI SK FACTORS We are subject to numerous risks, and the material risks that management believe affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations are described below. Many of these risks are beyond our control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing financial and operational results. You should carefully read and consider the following risks factors. The occurrence of any of the following risks, as well as risks of which we are currently unaware or currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. As a result, the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the following risks and other information in this Report or incorporated into this Report by reference, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” should be carefully considered before investing in shares of our common stock. Some statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Report. Risks Related To Our Business As a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions. Our business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. Weak economic conditions are characterized by numerous factors, including deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. The current economic environment is also characterized by interest rates at near historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our loan and investment portfolios. All of these factors can individually or in the aggregate be detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our business and operations are concentrated in our Target Market, and we are more sensitive than our more geographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy. Unlike with many of our larger competitors that maintain significant operations located outside our market area, substantially all of our clients are individuals and businesses located and doing business in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 93% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market. Therefore, our success will depend upon the general economic conditions in this area, which we cannot predict with certainty. As a result, our operations and profitability may be more adversely affected by a local economic downturn in our Target Market than those of larger, more geographically diverse competitors. For example, the Nashville economy is particularly sensitive to changes in the healthcare service, music and entertainment and hospitality and tourism industries, among others. A downturn in these industries or in the local economy generally could make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay their loans and may lead to loan losses that are not offset by operations in other markets; it may also reduce the ability of depositors to make or maintain deposits with us. For these reasons, any regional or local economic downturn that affects our Target market, or existing or prospective borrowers or depositors in our Target Market could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. From time to time, our bank may provide financing to clients who own or have companies or properties located outside our Target Market. In such cases, we would face similar local market risk in those communities for these clients. 15 Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability. The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, internet banks, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our service area. These competitors often have far greater resources than we do and are able to conduct more intensive and broader-based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and individual clients. Our competitors may be able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we choose or have the capability to offer. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. We compete with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we must attract our client base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with an array of financial institutions in our service area. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things: • our ability to recruit and retain experienced and talented bankers at competitive compensation levels; • our ability to build and maintain long-term client relationships while ensuring high ethical standards and safe and sound banking practices; • the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services that we offer; • client satisfaction with our products and services; • industry and general economic trends; and • our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates that we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. We derive a substantial majority of our business from our Target Market, which is a highly competitive banking market. Our failure to compete effectively in our market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are dependent on the services of our management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key personnel or directors may adversely affect our business and operations. We are led by an experienced core management team with substantial experience in the markets that we serve, and our operating strategy focuses on providing products and services through long-term relationship managers and ensuring that our largest clients have relationships with our senior management team. Accordingly, our success depends in large part on the performance of these key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. If any of our executive officers, other key personnel, or directors leaves us or our bank, our operations may be adversely affected. While we have employment agreements containing non-competition provisions with many of our key personnel, if any of such personnel leaves his or her position for any reason, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified personnel to replace them. Additionally, our directors’ community involvement and diverse and extensive local business relationships are important to our success. 16 Our business strategy includes the continuation of our growth plans, and we could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. We intend to continue pursuing our growth strategy for our business through organic growth of our loan and deposit portfolio as well as through strategic acquisitions. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties that can be encountered by financial service companies in rapid growth stages, which include the risks associated with the following: • maintaining loan quality; • maintaining adequate management personnel and information systems to oversee such growth; • maintaining adequate control and compliance functions; • obtaining regulatory approvals with respect to acquisitions; • entry into new markets, industries, and product areas; and • securing capital and liquidity needed to support anticipated growth. We may not be able to expand our presence in our existing market or new markets. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas, the availability of capital to fund growth opportunities and our ability to manage our growth. Failure to manage our growth effectively could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. As a bank that focuses on building comprehensive banking relationships with clients, our reputation is critical to our business, and damage to it could have a material adverse effect on us. A key differentiating factor for our business is the strong brand we are building in our target markets. Through our branding, we communicate to the market about our company and the products and services we offer. Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining clients and employees. Adverse perceptions of us could make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including actual or perceived employee misconduct, misconduct by our outsourced service providers or other counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, our failure to meet our standards of service and quality and compliance failures. Negative publicity regarding us or our bank, whether or not accurate, may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients, who may have greater credit risk than larger borrowers. We target small and medium sized businesses as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive, economic or financial pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. 17 Our concentration of large loans to a limited number of borrowers may increase our credit risk. Our growth over the last several years has been partially attributable to our ability to originate and retain large loans. In addition to regulatory limits to which our bank is subject, we have established an internal policy limiting loans to one borrower, principal or guarantor based on “total exposure,” which represents the aggregate exposure of economically related borrowers for approval purposes; loans in excess of our internal limit require acknowledgment by our bank’s full board of directors. Many of these loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2018, our 25 largest borrowing relationships accounted for approximately 18% of our total loan portfolio. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, this high concentration of borrowers presents a risk to our lending operations. If any one of these borrowers becomes unable to repay its loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce or death, our non-accrual loans and our allowance for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. To mitigate this risk, we establish internal lending limits tied to the borrower’s risk profile, seek collateral, and involve increasing levels of senior management and board involvement in the approval of large loan relationships. Lack of seasoning of our loan portfolio could increase risk of credit defaults in the future. As a result of our growth over the past several years, as of December 31, 2018, approximately 54% of our loan portfolio had been originated since December 31, 2016, including new originations and renewals. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as “seasoning.” As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Because a large portion of our portfolio is relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level of delinquencies and defaults that could occur as the portfolio becomes more seasoned and may not serve as a reliable basis for predicting the health and nature of our loan portfolio. Our limited experience with these loans does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of our loan portfolio. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We may not be able to adequately assess and limit our credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability. A primary component of our business involves making loans to clients. The business of lending is inherently risky because the principal of or interest on the loan may not be repaid timely or at all or the value of any collateral supporting the loan may be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower’s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring our loan applicants and the concentration of our loans within specific lines of business and our credit approval practices, may not adequately assess credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively assess and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 18 Repayment of our leveraged loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our leveraged loans are primarily commercial in nature and often contained within our healthcare portfolio. Frequently, these loans have a secondary source of repayment that is directly correlated with the primary source of repayment. Leveraged borrowers may have a diminished ability to adjust to unexpected events and changes in business conditions because of a higher ratio of liabilities to capital, and in some cases, reliance is placed on enterprise value as a secondary source of repayment. The repayment of leveraged loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and on enterprise value as a secondary source of repayment. To mitigate this risk, we give enhanced scrutiny to leveraged loan transactions, assess risk probabilities using benchmarks obtained from external rating agencies, and engage higher levels of senior management and board involvement in the approval and ongoing review of leveraged loan relationships. Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management’s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of concentrations within our lines of business, specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes in a relatively short time period. Inaccurate management assumptions, continuing deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan portfolio and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and may require adjustments based upon judgments that are different than those of management. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, we may need to increase our provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for such losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The healthcare service industry is an integral component of the local economy, and adverse trends in the healthcare service industry could have a material adverse effect on us. The healthcare service industry is an integral segment of the local economy. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 12% of our loan portfolio was composed of loans to borrowers in the healthcare service industry. Adverse trends in the healthcare service industry may have a negative impact on a significant portion of the Company’s borrowers and clients. The healthcare service industry may be affected by the following: • trends in the method of delivery of healthcare services; • competition among healthcare providers; • consolidation of large health insurers; • lower reimbursement rates from government and commercial payors, high uncompensated care expense, investment losses and limited admissions growth pressuring operating profit margins for healthcare providers; • availability of capital; • credit downgrades; • liability insurance expense; • regulatory and government reimbursement uncertainty resulting from changes to laws governing the delivery of healthcare services and reimbursement of providers of healthcare services; • congressional efforts to repeal and federal court cases challenging the legality of certain aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; 19 • health reform initiatives to address healthcare costs through expanded value-based purchasing programs, bundled provider payments, health insurance exchanges, increased patient cost-sharing, geographic payment variations, comparative effectiveness research, lower payments for hospital readmissions, and shared risk-and-reward payment models such as accountable care organizations; • federal and state government plans to reduce budget deficits and address debt ceiling limits by lowering healthcare provider Medicare and Medicaid payment rates, while requiring increased patient access to care; • equalizing Medicare payment rates across different facility-type settings; • heightened health information technology security standards and the meaningful use of electronic health records by healthcare providers; and • potential tax law changes affecting healthcare providers. These changes, among others, could adversely affect the economic performance of some or all of our borrowers and clients in the healthcare services industry and, in turn, have a materially negative impact on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans. Our loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, or CRE loans, to individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as construction and land development loans. CRE loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. Weak economic conditions or other market factors can result in increased vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial property. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate under adverse conditions. Additionally, non-owner-occupied CRE loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner-occupied CRE loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We mitigate these risks both in our selection criteria for borrowers and project sponsors and in our general practice of requiring cash equity contributions substantially in excess of Supervisory Loan to Value limits as set forth in Appendix A of Part 365 – Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies. A prolonged downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and adversely affect our profitability. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 10% of our loan portfolio was composed of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 29% of owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 18% consumer real estate loans, and 12% construction and land development loans. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A decline in real estate values could further impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amounts we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. If we are required to re-value the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 20 Regulatory requirements affecting our loans secured by commercial real estate could limit our ability to leverage our capital and adversely affect our growth and profitability. The federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated their view that banks with high concentrations of loans secured by commercial real estate are subject to increased risk and should implement robust risk management policies and maintain higher capital than regulatory minimums to maintain an appropriate cushion against loss that is commensurate with the perceived risk. Federal bank regulatory guidelines identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk as those that have (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land loans representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital if the outstanding balance of the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on commercial real estate, a change in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us or a decline in our regulatory capital could limit our ability to leverage our capital as a result of these policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral and own the underlying real estate, subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property. Since we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: • general or local economic conditions; • environmental cleanup liability; • neighborhood assessments; • interest rates; • real estate tax rates; • operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; • supply of and demand for rental units or properties; • ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; • zoning laws; • governmental and regulatory rules; • fiscal policies; and • natural disasters. Our inability to manage the amount of costs or size of the risks associated with the ownership of real estate, or write-downs in the value of other real estate owned, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We have several large depositor relationships, the loss of which could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources. As of December 31, 2018, our ten largest non-brokered depositors accounted for approximately 13% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. We may also be forced, as a result of any withdrawal of deposits, to rely more heavily on other, potentially more expensive and less stable funding sources. Consequently, the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 21 Correspondent banking introduces unique risks, which could affect our liquidity. Although correspondent banking provides diversification of our funding base, it introduces a unique set of risks. Increases in the federal funds rate could create liquidity issues within the bank as it competes with the interest on reserves rate paid by the Federal Reserve Bank. Additionally, strong industry-wide loan demand could also create liquidity issues as excess balances held at CapStar Bank by our correspondent banks would presumably be redeployed by those banks into new loans. Further, capital inadequacy or asset quality issues at other institutions could result in increased risk to us due to the potential for large deposit withdrawals. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and our funding sources may be insufficient to fund our future growth. Liquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. An inability to raise funds, at competitive rates or at all, through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. In particular, approximately 82% of our bank’s deposits as of December 31, 2018 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice, while by comparison, 76% of the assets of our bank were loans at December 31, 2018, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. For example, we rely on deposits, federal funds purchased and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (“FHLB”) to fund our operations. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions were to change. In such a circumstance, we may seek additional borrowings to achieve our long-term business objectives; however, they may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, whole loan sale agreements may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach representations or warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including government-sponsored entities, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet deposit withdrawals and other client needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our profits. Our profits, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our interest rate sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2018, meaning that our net interest income would increase more from rising interest rates than from falling interest rates. However, many assumptions are used to model the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income. Due to the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions, our models may not be an accurate indicator of how our interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. 22 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Changes in monetary policy and government responses to adverse economic conditions such as inflation and deflation may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve, could lead to inflation, deflation, or other economic phenomena that could adversely affect our financial performance. The primary impact of inflation on our operations most likely will be reflected in increased operating costs. Conversely, deflation generally will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality. Our bank’s size presents multiple challenges that may restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy, such as our regulatory and internal lending limits and our ability to effectively leverage our infrastructure to implement our business strategy. We are limited in the amount our bank can loan in the aggregate to a single borrower or related borrowers by the amount of the bank’s capital. CapStar Bank is a Tennessee-chartered bank and therefore is subject to the legal lending limits of the state of Tennessee and federal law. Tennessee and federal legal lending limits are safety and soundness measures intended to prevent one person or a relatively small and economically related group of persons from borrowing an unduly large amount of a bank’s funds. They are also intended to safeguard a bank’s depositors by diversifying the risk of loan losses among a relatively large number of credit-worthy borrowers engaged in various types of businesses. Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower generally may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly. We have also established an internal limit on loans to one borrower between 7% and 15% of our risked based capital, depending upon the underlying risk rating. Loans in excess of our internal limit are noted as a policy exception and require acknowledgment by our bank’s full board of directors. Based upon our bank’s current capital levels, the amount it may lend is significantly less than that of many of our larger competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of the bank’s lending limit from doing business with us. Our bank accommodates larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available. If we are unable to compete effectively for loans from our target clients, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 23 Our growth strategy involves strategic acquisitions, and we may not be able to overcome risks associated with such transactions. We plan to continue to explore opportunities to acquire other financial institutions and businesses in or around our existing Target Market or in comparable markets or that would provide scale, low cost of funds, non-interest income or lines of business that are additive to our existing products and services. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including the following: • the need to raise new capital; • the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our management’s attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business; • the lack of history among our management team in working together on acquisitions and related integration activities; • the time, expense, difficulty, and uncertainty of integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses; • an inability to realize expected synergies or returns on investment; • failure to discover the existence of liabilities during the due diligence process; • exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may not be indemnified; • potential disruption of our ongoing banking business; and • a loss of key employees or key clients following an acquisition. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying prospective transactions, making it difficult to implement our growth strategy. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future to fund such growth, and the unavailability of additional capital on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect us or our growth. We believe that we have sufficient capital to meet our capital needs for our immediate growth plans. However, we will continue to need capital to support our longer-term growth plans. If capital is not available on favorable terms when we need it, we may have to either issue common stock or other securities on less than desirable terms or reduce our rate of growth until market conditions become more favorable. Either of such events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The fair value of our investment securities could fluctuate because of factors outside of our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Factors beyond our control could significantly affect the fair value of our investment securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments, or OTTI, and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in earnings and/or other comprehensive income (loss), which could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is OTTI usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer, any collateral underlying the security as well as the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Our failure to assess any impairments or losses with respect to our securities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 24 Deterioration in the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and downgrades in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and federal agency securities could adversely affect us and our banking operations. The long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government is uncertain, as illustrated by the 2011 downgrade by certain rating agencies of the credit rating of the U.S. government and federal agencies. However, in addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any future downgrade, failure to raise the U.S. statutory debt limit, or deterioration in the fiscal outlook of the U.S. federal government, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. In particular, such events could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect our profitability. Also, the adverse consequences of any downgrade could extend to those to whom we extend credit and could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our borrowers, other third parties, and our employees. When we originate loans, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal, title information and employment and income documentation. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the fair value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, the borrower, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. The persons and entities involved in such a misrepresentation are often difficult to locate, and we are often unable to collect any monetary losses that we have suffered from them. We may bear costs associated with the proliferation of computer theft and cyber-crime. We necessarily collect, use and hold sensitive data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with client expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. Although we actively invest in the security of our technological infrastructure, it is not feasible to defend against every risk posed by rapid technological development and the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our information technology department and third-party vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our employees or other internal sources, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our client accounts may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from network failures, viruses and malware, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters and catastrophic events. A breach of our security or the security of our third-party vendors that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, client notification requirements, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage, any of which could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. 25 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us. Our risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, liquidity, capital, financial performance, asset/liability, operational, compliance and regulatory, Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, strategic and reputational, information technology and legal. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances, including if our management fails to follow our credit policies and procedures, and thus, it may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. We depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption in the operation of these systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of clients, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data. We rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio accounting. For example, one vendor provides our core banking system through a service bureau arrangement. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of client data. We may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such a disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. We encounter technological change continually and have fewer resources than certain of our competitors to invest in technological improvements. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to serving clients better, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our success will depend in part on our ability to address our clients’ needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than us, and in the future, we may not be able to implement new technology-driven products and services timely, effectively or at all or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may, in order to remain competitive, be required to make significant capital expenditures, which may increase our overall expenses and have a material adverse effect on our net income. There is also no guarantee that any such investment in these products and services will create additional efficiencies in our operations. 26 We may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems in the past and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities. In the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to additional credit and market risk. We use interest rate swaps to help manage our interest rate risk from recorded financial assets and liabilities when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and the asset or liability exposes us to interest rate risk or risks inherent in client related derivatives. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and routine monitoring, and is not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. We also have derivatives that result from a service we provide to certain qualifying clients approved through our credit process, and therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rates change in ways that are significantly different from what we expected when we entered into the derivative transaction. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of lawsuits and related legal proceedings, governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm. 27 Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we may not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings or government or other inquiries. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly materially so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our Target Market is susceptible to floods, tornados and other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God, which may adversely affect our business and operations. Substantially all of our business and operations are located in our Target Market, which is an area that has recently been damaged by floods and tornadoes and that is susceptible to other natural disasters, adverse weather events, nuclear fallout from nuclear plants in East Tennessee and acts of God. Natural disasters, adverse weather events and acts of God can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. Any economic decline as a result of natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God can reduce the demand for loans and our other client solutions as well as client ability to repay such loans. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on loan portfolios may increase substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God. Therefore, natural disasters, adverse weather events or acts of God could result in decreased revenue and loan losses that have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation. We are not currently required to comply with SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are, therefore, not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose. We will be required to comply with these rules upon ceasing to be an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. When evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Further, the cost of any such compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be substantial and have a material effect on our cash flows and earnings. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing, and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system and hiring additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows. 28 Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the Tax Reform Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The Tax Reform Act significantly changes how corporations in the United States are taxed. The Tax Reform Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As a result, we have recorded a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Reform Act on our deferred tax assets in our financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the Tax Reform Act, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The impact of the Tax Reform Act on our shareholders is uncertain and could be adverse. This Report does not discuss the manner in which the Tax Reform Act might affect our shareholders. Accordingly, we encourage our shareholders to consult with their own legal and tax advisors with respect to the Tax Reform Act and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock. Risks Related to Our Industry We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our business activities and impose financial requirements, such as minimum capital requirements, and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies including the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. Regulatory compliance is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, transactions with affiliates, treatment of our clients, and interest rates paid on deposits. We are also subject to financial requirements prescribed by our regulators such as minimum capitalization guidelines, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. Violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank acquisitions and other activities. Recently, banks generally have faced increased regulatory sanctions and scrutiny particularly with respect to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, or USA Patriot Act, and other statutes relating to anti-money laundering compliance and client privacy. Recent legislation has substantially changed, and increased, federal regulation of financial institutions, and there may be significant future legislation (and regulations under existing legislation) that could have a further material effect on bank holding companies like us and banks like CapStar Bank. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Federal and state regulators periodically examine our business and may require us to remediate adverse examination findings or may take enforcement action against us. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, the Federal Reserve or the TDFI were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to require us to remediate any such adverse examination findings. 29 In addition, these agencies have the power to take enforcement action against us to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation of law or regulation or unsafe or unsound practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, to limit dividends and distributions, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us or our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory enforcement action against us could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are subject to numerous fair lending laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. The CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, federal banking agencies, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new lines of business. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial service providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service, or IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the requirement to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Financial reform legislation has, among other things, tightened capital standards, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and resulted in new regulations that are likely to increase our costs of operations. As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act depends on the rules and regulations that implement it. Among many other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. 30 The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. We are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress. Under federal law and long-standing Federal Reserve policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our bank, and to commit resources to support our bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our shareholders’ or creditors,’ best interests to do so. A requirement to provide such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of repayment to deposit liabilities of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment over general unsecured creditor claims. Our FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase. The deposits of our bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments as determined according to the calculation described in “Supervision and Regulation—Bank Regulation and Supervision—FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments.” High levels of bank failures since the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund following the financial crisis, the FDIC increased deposit insurance assessment rates and charged special assessments to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional financial institution failures. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Even though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange. The trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. Because of this, it may be more difficult for stockholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which stockholders could sell a smaller number of shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. 31 A future issuanc e or future issuances of stock could dilute the value of our common stock. Our charter permits us to issue up to an aggregate of 25 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2018, 17,724,721 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, including 157,616 shares of restricted common stock that have yet to vest. Those shares outstanding do not include the potential issuance, as of December 31, 2018, of 878,049 shares of our common stock that are issuable upon conversion of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. 507,903 shares of our common stock subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options under the Stock Incentive Plan, and 422,900 additional shares of our common stock that were reserved for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan. A future issuance of any new shares of our common stock would, and equity-related securities could, cause further dilution in the value of our outstanding shares of common stock. Significant sales of our common stock by certain shareholders could affect the market value of our common stock. On December 21, 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 registering 3,652,094 shares of our common stock held by certain of our long-time shareholders, representing about 20.7% of our total shares of issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, these shares represent a significant number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and, if sold in the market all at once or at about the same time, could depress the market price of our common stock and could further affect our ability to raise equity capital. Further, we cannot predict the size or the effect, if any, that sales of these shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may have on the market price of our shares of common stock or our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Any significant sales of these shares could have a materially adverse impact on our affairs, assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, short- and long-term performance goals, prospects and results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in our bank, to secure that debt. We have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, interest must be paid to a lender before dividends can be paid to our shareholders, and, in the case of liquidation, our borrowings must be repaid before we can distribute any assets to our shareholders. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if our bank were profitable. The rights of our common shareholders are subordinate to the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and any debt securities that we may issue and may be subordinate to the holders of any other class of preferred stock that we may issue in the future. As of December 31, 2018, we have 878,049 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. These shares have certain rights that are senior to our common stock. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors, cash dividends to the same extent and on the same basis as cash dividends as declared by our board of directors with respect to common stock. Such dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock are payable on the same dates as dividends on shares of common stock but prior to the payment of any dividends on shares of common stock. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $10.25 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus any amount equal to all dividends declared and unpaid thereon, before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue an aggregate of up to five million shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. Accordingly, you should assume that any shares of preferred stock that we may issue in the future will also be senior to our common stock. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 32 We and our bank are subject to capital and other legal and regulatory requirements which restrict our ability to pay dividends. We are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. In addition, because our bank is our only material asset, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends on our receipt of dividends from the bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an “emerging growth company,” as described in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These include, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial reporting requirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, a potential exemption from new auditing standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years, unless we earlier cease to be an emerging growth company, which would occur if our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these reduced regulatory and reporting requirements, which may result in a less active trading market and increased volatility in our stock price.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS General From time to time, the Company is party to legal actions that are routine and incidental to its business. Given the nature, scope and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to the Company’s business, including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, the Company, like all banking organizations, is subject to heightened legal and regulatory compliance and litigation risk. However, based upon available information and in consultation with legal counsel, management does not expect the ultimate disposition of any or a combination of these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and\or results of operations. Litigation Against Gaylon M. Lawrence & The Lawrence Group On October 31, 2017, CapStar filed a complaint, captioned CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. v. Gaylon M. Lawrence & The Lawrence Group , Case No. 3:17-cv-01421, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, in connection with Mr. Lawrence and The Lawrence Group's acquisition of CapStar stock. The complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") by filing materially false and misleading Schedules 13D regarding defendants' acquisition of a minority stake (1,156,675 shares) of CapStar stock. It also alleged that defendants violated the Change in Bank Control Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1817(j) (the ""CBCA""), by attempting to acquire control of CapStar without first receiving approval from the Federal Reserve, and also that defendants violated Tennessee Code Section 45-2-107 by controlling banks without having registered as a bank holding company. By order dated December 18, 2017, the court granted CapStar's motion for expedited discovery, which is presently underway. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the action as well as a separate motion to stay. The motion to stay was denied by the court on May 21, 2018. On September 24, 2018, the court denied in part and granted in part defendants' motion to dismiss, permitting CapStar's claims that defendants violated Tennessee Code Section 45-2-107 under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act to proceed. Mr. Lawrence has also filed an Interagency Notice of Change in Control pursuant to the CBCA with the Federal Reserve on October 30, 2017, seeking permission to acquire up to 15% of the outstanding voting shares of CapStar's common stock. At the Federal Reserve's direction, on March 13, 2018, Mr. Lawrence requested that the Federal Reserve suspend processing of this notice. On November 6, 2018, the Federal Reserve notified the Company that it has determined not to disapprove the notice, subject to compliance by Mr. Lawrence and his affiliates with extensive representations and commitments set forth in correspondence between Mr. Lawrence and the Federal Reserve. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 34 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES CapStar Financial’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CSTR” and has traded on that market since September 22, 2016. Prior to that time, there was no established public trading market for our stock. The following table shows the high and low sales price information for our common stock for each full quarter in 2018 and 2017 as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Price Per Share High Low 2018: First quarter $ 19.84 $ 19.12 Second quarter 19.54 18.96 Third quarter 18.20 17.84 Fourth quarter 15.74 15.21 2017: First quarter $ 22.05 $ 18.52 Second quarter 19.53 16.96 Third quarter 19.62 16.00 Fourth quarter 22.22 18.73 As of March 11, 2019 there were 2,022 holders of record of shares of our common stock and one holder of record of shares of our non-voting common stock.

For information regarding securities authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans, please see Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management And Related Stockholder Matters. On December 21, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to the lesser of $8,000,000 or 250,000 shares of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had not yet repurchased any shares of common stock under the terms of the Repurchase Program. 35 Stock Performance Graph The following stock performance graph compares total shareholders return on our common stock for the period beginning at the close of trading on September 22, 2016 until December 31, 2018, with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Bank Index for the same period. Cumulative total return is computed by dividing the difference between the share price of our common stock at the end and the beginning of the measurement period by the share price of our common stock at the beginning of the measurement period. The performance graph assumes $100 is invested on September 22, 2016 in shares of our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ Bank Index. Historical stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The information in this paragraph and the following stock performance graph shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C, other than as provided in Item 201 of Regulation S-K, or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically request that such information be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporate it by reference into a filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (CSTR) NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC) NASDAQ Bank Index (BKX) 09/22/2016 $ 100 $ 100 $ 100 12/31/2016 138 103 128 12/31/2017 131 133 135 12/31/2018 93 128 113 Dividend Policy Holders of shares of our voting and non-voting common and preferred stock are only entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for dividends. As a Tennessee corporation, we are not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. Because we are a bank holding company and do not engage directly in business activities of a material nature, our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock depends, in large part, upon our receipt of dividends from our bank, which is also subject to numerous limitations on the payment of dividends under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. Pursuant to Tennessee law, our bank may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI, pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our bank’s net income for that year plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. For additional information, see “Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Bank Regulation and Supervision—Payment of Dividends.” 36 The following table shows the dividends that have been declared on our voting and non-voting common stock and preferred stock with respect to the periods indicated below. Per share amounts are presented to the nearest cent.

Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders in the future will depend on regulatory restrictions and our liquidity and capital requirements, as well as our earnings and financial condition, the general economic climate, contractual restrictions, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Use of Proceeds On September 27, 2016, the Company sold 1,688,049 shares of its common stock, including 387,750 shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to the full exercise of their purchase option, in its initial public offering (“IPO”). In addition, certain selling shareholders participated in the IPO and sold an aggregate of 1,284,701 shares of the Company’s common stock. The shares were sold at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $44.6 million. The aggregate offering price for the shares sold by the Company was approximately $25.3 million, and after deducting approximately $1.6 million for the underwriting discount and approximately $2.1 million of offering expenses paid to third parties, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $21.6 million. The aggregate offering price for the shares sold by the selling shareholders was approximately $19.3 million. All of the shares were sold pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-213367), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 21, 2016. The offering did not terminate until all of the shares offered were sold. The Company made no payments to its directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of its common stock or to their associates, or to its affiliates in connection with the issuance and sale of the common stock or in connection with the use of IPO proceeds. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. and Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. acted as lead book-running managers for the initial public offering. Our common stock is currently trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “CSTR.” There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our prospectus filed with the SEC on September 23, 2016 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act. Pending application of the IPO proceeds, we have invested the net proceeds in short-term investments. During 2017, the Company provided $10.0 million of the IPO proceeds as a capital contribution to the Bank for working capital purposes. 37 ITEM 6.

On October 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Athens and Athens Federal. For more information, please see “Item 1.—Business—Overview—Acquisitions”. The operations of Athens are included in our financial statements beginning October 1, 2018. The acquisition and incorporation of Athens into our financial statements may materially affect the comparability of the selected financial data provided for fiscal year 2018 as compared to previous years. 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion of our financial condition and our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under the caption “Part II., Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this Report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law. The following discussion and analysis pertains to our historical results on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, the following discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level. All dollar amounts in the tables in this section are in thousands of dollars, except per share data or when otherwise specifically noted. Unless specifically noted in this Report, all references in this section to the fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 mean our fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Overview We completed 2018 with net income of $9.7 million, or $0.67 diluted net income per share, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.12 diluted net income per share for 2017. Average loans for 2018 were $1.13 billion, a 14.9% increase over 2017, and average deposits for 2018 were $1.25 billion, a 12.4% increase over 2017. The comparability of our financial condition and performance has been impacted by our acquisition of Athens which we completed in 2018 and the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, in each case as discussed below. We acquired Athens on October 1, 2018. On the acquisition date, the fair market value of Athens’ net assets was $61.6 million, including $344.8 million in loans and $404.5 million in deposits. Net income for 2018 was reduced by $9.8 million of pretax merger related charges related to this acquisition. The Athens acquisition further expanded our franchise into the East Tennessee market. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Among other items, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of such decrease, we recognized an increase in income tax expense of $3.56 million in 2017 resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets. Our primary revenue source is net interest income and fees from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and the rates paid on deposits directly impact our profitability. Business volumes are influenced by competition, new business acquisition efforts and economic factors including market interest rates, business spending and consumer confidence. Net interest income increased $9.8 million, or 23.5%, to $51.7 million for 2018 compared to $41.9 million for 2017. The positive effects of increased volumes and yields on earning assets were partially offset by the negative effects of increasing deposit costs. Net interest margin increased to 3.55% for 2018, compared with 3.25% for 2017. Provision for loan losses was $2.8 million in 2018 compared to $12.9 million in 2017, a 77.9% decrease. This decrease was primarily the result of lower charge-offs, which were $5.0 million in 2018 compared to $12.8 million in 2017. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management’s evaluation, is adequate to provide coverage for the estimated probable inherent losses on outstanding loans. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2018 was 0.85% of total loans, compared with 1.45% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Our acquisition of Athens, specifically Athens’ loan portfolio, significantly impacted the comparability of our allowance for loan loss ratios between periods. On October 1, 2018, we acquired $344.8 million in loans, which includes a preliminary fair value discount of $4.8 million. At December 31, 2018, these acquired loans do not have a significant amount of allowance for loan losses associated with them. 39 Total noninterest income for 2018 increased $4.6 million, or 41.7%, to $15.5 million compared to $10.9 million for 2017, and comprised 19% of total revenues. Total noninterest expense for 2018 increased $19.7 million, or 58.4%, to $53.5 million compared to $33.8 million for 2017. Included in noninterest expense for 2018 is $9.8 million of merger related charges. Our efficiency ratio for 2018 was 79.7% compared to 64.0% for 2017. The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 10.8% for 2018 from 75.5% for 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a $3.6 million write-down of our deferred tax assets resulting from the Tax Reform Act in 2017. Tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a measure of a company's capital which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Our ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets was 10.39% as of December 31, 2018, compared with 9.84% at December 31, 2017. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The following sections provide more details on subjects presented in this overview. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which are contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may materially and adversely affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent in those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable and appropriate. Allowance for Loan Losses We record estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio as an allowance for loan losses. The methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan losses involve significant judgments to be made by management. Some of the more critical judgments supporting our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit-worthiness of borrowers, estimated value of underlying collateral, assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, and the impact of current events, conditions, and other factors impacting the level of inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions, the actual or estimated credit losses ultimately realized by us may be different from our estimates. In determining the allowance, we estimate losses on individual impaired loans and on groups of loans that are not impaired, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, we assess the risk inherent in our loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses, and the impacts of local, regional, and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Based on this analysis, we may record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. For a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is included elsewhere in this Report. 40 Investment Securities Impairment We assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security with respect to which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any instance, we would consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and, for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. Securities with respect to which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using the asset and liability method, which recognizes a liability or asset representing the tax effects, based on current tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance may be established to the extent necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to a level at which it is “more likely than not” that the tax asset or benefit will be realized. Realization of tax benefits depends on having sufficient taxable income, available tax loss carrybacks or credits, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and/or tax planning strategies within the reversal period, and that current tax law allows for the realization of recorded tax benefits. Business Combinations Assets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. When the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the loans are considered impaired, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded. We must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on interest income. Purchased loans without evidence of credit deterioration are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted as necessary for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisions that may be required.

Return on average shareholders’ equity was 5.50%, 1.05% and 7.57% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following sections provide a more detailed analysis of significant factors affecting our operating results. 41 Net Interest Income The largest component of our net income is net interest income – the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support our assets. Net interest income divided by total average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin. The major factors that affect net interest income and net interest margin are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our margin can also be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand and deposit flow. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and our net interest income. The following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Average Outstanding Balance Interest Income/ Expense Average Yield/ Rate Interest-Earning Assets Loans (1) $ 1,134,836 $ 57,962 5.11 % $ 987,710 $ 43,531 4.41 % $ 888,541 $ 38,450 4.33 % Loans held for sale 58,250 2,789 4.79 % 49,466 2,070 4.19 % 47,303 1,763 3.73 % Securities: Taxable investment securities (2) 166,287 4,755 2.86 % 166,538 4,092 2.46 % 176,974 3,729 2.11 % Investment securities exempt from federal income tax (3) 47,270 1,201 3.22 % 52,153 1,230 3.63 % 47,356 1,158 3.76 % Total securities 213,557 5,956 2.94 % 218,691 5,322 2.74 % 224,330 4,887 2.46 % Cash balances in other banks 54,454 1,011 1.85 % 49,990 551 1.10 % 51,147 276 0.54 % Funds sold 2,483 63 2.55 % 2,518 41 1.63 % 2,153 19 0.89 % Total interest-earning assets 1,463,580 67,781 4.65 % 1,308,375 51,515 3.99 % 1,213,474 45,395 3.79 % Noninterest-earning assets 65,336 49,419 49,289 Total assets $ 1,528,916 $ 1,357,794 $ 1,262,763 Interest-Bearing Liabilities Interest bearing deposits: Interest-bearing transaction accounts $ 330,952 4,164 1.26 % $ 301,411 2,447 0.81 % $ 269,113 1,489 0.55 % Savings and money market deposits 424,052 5,446 1.28 % 378,640 3,188 0.84 % 445,873 2,859 0.64 % Time deposits 227,760 3,940 1.73 % 194,892 2,445 1.25 % 193,881 2,085 1.08 % Total interest-beraring deposits 982,764 13,550 1.38 % 874,943 8,080 0.92 % 908,867 6,433 0.71 % Borrowings and repurchase agreements 99,450 2,539 2.55 % 98,289 1,572 1.60 % 32,371 498 1.54 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,082,214 16,089 1.49 % 973,232 9,652 0.99 % 941,238 6,931 0.74 % Noninterest-bearing deposits 262,280 232,687 189,270 Total funding sources 1,344,494 1,205,919 1,130,508 Noninterest-bearing liabilities 8,736 8,473 12,132 Shareholders’ equity 175,686 143,402 120,123 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 1,528,916 $ 1,357,794 $ 1,262,763 Net interest spread (4) 3.17 % 3.00 % 3.06 % Net interest income/margin (5) $ 51,692 3.55 % $ 41,863 3.25 % $ 38,464 3.22 % 42 (1) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans.

(3) Yields on tax exempt securities are shown on a tax equivalent basis. (4) Net interest spread is the average yield on total interest-earning assets minus the average rate on total interest-bearing liabilities. (5) Net interest margin is net interest income calculated on a tax equivalent basis divided by total average interest-earning assets. The following table reflects, for the periods indicated, the changes in our net interest income due to changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the associated rates paid or earned on these assets and liabilities. 2018 Compared to 2017 2017 Compared to 2016 Increase (decrease) due to Increase (decrease) due to Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net Interest-Earning Assets Loans $ 6,484 $ 7,947 $ 14,431 $ 4,291 $ 790 $ 5,081 Loans held for sale 368 351 719 81 227 308 Securities: Taxable investment securities (6 ) 670 664 (219 ) 568 349 Investment securities exempt from federal income tax (115 ) 85 (30 ) 117 (31 ) 86 Total securities (121 ) 755 634 (102 ) 537 435 Cash Balances In Other Banks 49 410 459 (6 ) 280 274 Funds Sold (1 ) 24 23 3 19 22 Total interest-earning assets 6,779 9,487 16,266 4,267 1,853 6,120 Interest Bearing Liabilities Interest-bearing transaction accounts 240 1,477 1,717 179 779 958 Savings and money market deposits 382 1,876 2,258 (431 ) 760 329 Time deposits 412 1,084 1,496 11 348 359 Borrowings and repurchase agreements 19 947 966 1,015 60 1,075 Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,053 5,384 6,437 774 1,947 2,721 Net Interest Income $ 5,726 $ 4,103 $ 9,829 $ 3,493 $ (94 ) $ 3,399 2018 compared to 2017 Our net interest income increased $9.8 million, or 23.5%, from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to increasing loan volumes and interest rates rising at a faster pace than interest bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin was 3.55% and 3.25% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. For 2018 and 2017, average loan yields increased from 4.41% to 5.11% which was primarily driven by increases in short-term interest rate indexes affecting the variable rate portion of our loan portfolio, offset by competitive pricing pressures. From September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2018, the LIBOR – 1 month interest rate increased from 0.53% to 2.52%. Approximately 58% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 is variable in nature and indexed to 1 month LIBOR. Average loans for 2018 increased 14.9% compared to 2017 as a result of the Athens acquisition, adding new bankers in the Nashville MSA and continued focus on attracting new clients. Average security yields increased from 2.74% to 2.94% for 2017 and 2018, respectively, primarily due to increases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio. The resulting yield on average interest-earning assets increased 66 basis points for 2018 compared to 2017. 43 We funded our growth in loans through an increase in funding sources of 11.5% from 2017 to 2018. The primary driver of our increased funding sources was growth in our deposits of 12.4% from 2017 to 2018 which was largely driven by the acquisition. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased 12.7% from 2017 to 2018. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.49% for 2018 compared to 0.99% for 2017. The majority of this increase was due to increases in the Fed Funds rate. The Fed Funds rate increased from 0.50% at September 30, 2016 to 2.50% at December 31, 2018. We passed along 50 basis points of the 200 basis point rate increase to our clients. 2017 compared to 2016 Our net interest income increased $3.4 million, or 8.8%, from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to increasing loan volumes, partially offset by the negative effects of increasing interest-bearing liabilities volumes and costs. Our net interest margin was 3.25% and 3.22% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to growth of our interest-earning assets at a higher pace than our interest-bearing liabilities. For 2017 and 2016, average loan yields increased from 4.33% to 4.41% which was primarily driven by increases in short-term interest rate indexes affecting the variable rate portion of our loan portfolio, offset by competitive pricing pressures. From September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2017, the LIBOR – 1 month interest rate increased from 0.53% to 1.56%. Approximately 65% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 was variable in nature and indexed to 1 month LIBOR. Average loans for 2017 increased 11.2% compared to 2016 as a result of adding new bankers in the Nashville MSA and continued focus on attracting new clients. Average security yields increased from 2.32% to 2.46% for 2016 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to increases in the LIBOR rate on the variable rate portion of our securities portfolio. The resulting yield on average interest-earning assets increased 22 basis points for 2017 compared to 2016. Provision for Loan losses Our policy is to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs and increased by loan recoveries. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.85%, 1.45% and 1.24% at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 2018 compared to 2017 The provision for loan losses amounted to $2.8 million and $12.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Provision expense is impacted by the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of net charge-offs. Provision expense decreased for 2018 compared to 2017 due to decreased charge-offs. Charge-offs for 2018 were $5.0 million compared to $12.8 million for 2017. In particular, during the second quarter of 2017, we charged-off the loans associated with one specific borrower as credit quality deteriorated and issues emerged which undermined our assessment that an expedient and positive outcome was possible. This particular charge-off, net of recoveries, amounted to $9.1 million in the aggregate. These loans experienced weakness due to the borrower’s declining financial condition, which led to falling values of the collateral securing these loans. Our primary collateral for these loans was the enterprise value of the borrower as determined by an Asset Purchase Agreement that was subsequently withdrawn. As the financial condition of the borrower deteriorated, ultimate repayment became increasingly difficult. We determined that timely repayment of these loans was unlikely and charged-off the loans. As a result, our provision expense decreased during 2018 compared to 2017. 44 Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.45% at December 31, 2017 to 0.85% at December 31, 2018. This decrease was largely due to the acquired Athens loan portfolio which was accounted for at its fair value as of the acquisition date. A preliminary fair value discount of $4.8 million was applied to the Athens loan portfolio. In addition, during 2018, we increased the look-back period, from which we calculate peer bank historical loss experience, from 33 to 37 quarters. Our look-back period is utilized to calculate peer historical loss experience, adjusted for current factors, to comprise the general component of the allowance for loan losses. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period is necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. The extension of the historical look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio. Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. While our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate markets, or particular industry or borrower-specific conditions, which may materially and negatively impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses. 2017 compared to 2016 The provision for loan losses amounted to $12.9 million and $2.8 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Provision expense increased for 2017 compared to 2016 due to increased charge-offs. Charge-offs for 2017 were $12.8 million compared to $1.5 million for 2016. This increase was caused primarily by deterioration in the credit quality of commercial and industrial loans to one borrower as described above. As a result, our provision expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from 1.24% at December 31, 2016 to 1.45% at December 31, 2017. This increase was largely due to our assessment of risk inherent in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio generally related to macro-economic, geo-political conditions and, in particular, uncertainty in the healthcare industry. In addition, during 2017, we increased the look-back period, from which we calculate peer bank historical loss experience, from 28 to 33 quarters. Noninterest Income In addition to net interest margin, we generate recurring noninterest income from our lines of business. Our banking operations generate revenue from service charges and fees on deposit accounts. We have a mortgage banking line of business that generates revenue from originating and selling mortgages, a line of business that originates and sells commercial real estate loans, and we have a revenue-sharing relationship with a registered broker-dealer, which generates wealth management fees. In addition to these types of recurring noninterest income, we own insurance on several key employees and record income on the increase in the cash surrender value of these policies. The following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest income for the periods indicated. 2018-2017 2017-2016 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2018 2017 (Decrease) 2016 (Decrease) Noninterest income: Treasury management and other deposit service charges $ 2,150 $ 1,516 41.8 % $ 1,108 36.8 % Net gain (loss) on sale of securities 3 (66 ) (104.5 )% 121 (154.5 )% Tri-Net fees 1,503 1,002 50.0 % 125 701.6 % Mortgage banking income 5,653 6,238 (9.4 )% 7,375 (15.4 )% Bank owned life insurance income 2,660 578 360.2 % 601 (3.8 )% Other noninterest income 3,490 1,640 112.8 % 1,754 (6.5 )% Total noninterest income $ 15,459 $ 10,908 41.7 % $ 11,084 (1.6 )% 45 201 8 compared to 201 7 The increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2018 and 2017 was driven primarily our acquisition of Athens and by transaction volume, which can fluctuate throughout and from year to year. Growth in the volume of our commercial and consumer deposit accounts was the primary contributor to the increase. Tri-Net fees represents a line of business, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, which originates and sells commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. The volume of loan sales has increased since this new line of business was implemented. Mortgage banking income consists of mortgage fee income from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated in our markets that are subsequently sold to third-party investors. Mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes. Mortgage banking income decreased 9.4% from 2017 to 2018 due to a lower volume of originations. The increase of $2.0 million in bank owned life insurance income from 2017 to 2018 was due to $2.0 million in non-taxable life insurance death benefit proceeds recognized in 2018. Other noninterest income primarily consists of loan related fees, interchange income and wealth management income. The increase of $1.9 million from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to organic growth and our acquisition of Athens. 2017 compared to 2016 The increase in treasury management and other deposit service charges for 2017 and 2016 was driven primarily by transaction volume, which can fluctuate throughout and from year to year. Growth in the volume of our commercial deposit accounts was the primary contributor to the increase. Tri-Net fees represent a new line of business, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, which originates and sells commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Mortgage banking income decreased 15.4% from 2016 to 2017 due to lower profit margins on loans sold and a lower volume of originations. Noninterest Expense Our total noninterest expense increase reflects expenses that we have incurred as we build the foundation to support our recent growth and enable us to execute our growth strategy. The following table presents the primary components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated. 2018-2017 2017-2016 Year Ended Percent Year Ended Percent December 31, Increase December 31, Increase 2018 2017 (Decrease) 2016 (Decrease) Noninterest expense: Salaries and employee benefits $ 28,586 $ 20,400 40.1 % $ 20,461 (0.3 )% Data processing and software 3,835 2,786 37.7 % 2,373 17.4 % Professional fees 1,608 1,522 5.7 % 1,554 (2.1 )% Occupancy 2,336 2,025 15.4 % 1,498 35.2 % Equipment 2,471 2,071 19.3 % 1,743 18.8 % Regulatory fees 1,028 1,111 (7.5 )% 1,091 1.8 % Merger related expenses 9,803 — 100.0 % — — Amortization of intangibles 465 48 868.8 % 54 (11.1 )% Other operating 3,355 3,802 (11.8 )% 4,355 (12.7 )% Total noninterest expense $ 53,487 $ 33,765 58.4 % $ 33,129 1.9 % 2018 compared to 2017 The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees in 2018 over 2017. At December 31, 2018, our associate base had expanded to 295 compared to 175 at December 31, 2017. Included in salaries and benefits are stock compensation and cash incentives, which increased over the prior year by approximately $3.8 million due to retention of key employees and improved financial performance of the Company. 46 Data processing and software expense increased from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions from organic growth and costs associated with running dual systems related to our acquisition of Athens. We expect the Athens related systems conversion to occur during the second quarter of 2019. The increase in equipment expense from 2017 to 2018 was related to the increasing cost of managing our IT network. Merger related expenses relate to our acquisition of Athens. Amortization of intangibles increased from 2017 to 2018 due to the new core deposit intangible recorded in connection with the Athens acquisition. Our efficiency ratio was 79.7% and 64.0% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income and measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratio was negatively impacted by merger expenses. 2017 compared to 2016 The largest increase between 2016 and 2017 within noninterest expense was related to the new lease of our corporate headquarters which we moved into in the first quarter of 2017. This new lease resulted in an increase in occupancy expense of 35.2%. Data processing and software expense increased from 2016 to 2017 due to an increase in the volume of transactions and implementation of new software in our mortgage banking line of business. The increase in equipment expense from 2016 to 2017 was related to the increasing cost of managing our IT network. A decrease in other operating expense of 12.7%, in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the fact that we did not have to significantly adjust contingent consideration expense in 2017. Our contingent consideration expense was the result of our acquisition of Farmington Financial Group, LLC in 2014. As mortgage origination volumes change from our original estimates the resulting increase or decrease in contingent consideration is recorded in other operating expense. Our efficiency ratio was 64.0% and 66.9% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The efficiency ratio was positively impacted by growth in our net interest income and noninterest income that outpaced our increases in expenses. For 2017, our revenue base (net interest income plus noninterest income) grew at rate of approximately three times our noninterest expense. Income Taxes 2018 compared to 2017 We recorded income tax expense of $1.2 million and $4.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2018 and 2017 was 10.8% and 75.5%, respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate by our investments in municipal securities, company owned life insurance, state tax credits, net of the effect of certain non-deductible expenses and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation and the 2017 tax law change. During 2018, the Company received $2.0 million in nontaxable life insurance death benefit proceeds resulting in a lower effective tax rate for 2018 compared to 2017. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted into law. The Tax Reform Act provides for significant changes to the U.S. tax code that impact businesses. Effective January 1, 2018, the U.S. federal tax rate for corporations was reduced from 35% to 21%, for U.S. taxable income and requires a one-time re-measurement of deferred taxes to reflect their value at a lower tax rate of 21%. Accordingly, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company is required to revalue its net deferred tax assets to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates on this deferred amount and record any change in the value of such assets as a one-time, non-cash charge on its income statement. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we recorded a $3.6 million increase in income tax expense for 2017. If we were to adjust this $3.6 million write-down out of income tax expense, our adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 17.5%. 47 2017 compared to 2016 We recorded income tax expense of $4.6 million and $4.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for 2017 and 2016 was 75.5% and 33.1%, respectively. 2017 income tax expense was reduced by $0.7 million as a result of implementing the new accounting guidance related to share-based payment award transactions referred to in the preceding paragraph. In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income tax consequences. In addition to other changes, the guidance changes the accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from generally being recognized in additional paid-in capital to recognition as income tax expense or benefit in the period they occur. We adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of 2017. As a result, our income tax expense was reduced by $1.1 million in 2018 and $0.7 million in 2017. Financial Condition 2018 compared to 2017 Total assets increased $619.5 million, or 46.1%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Loans grew from $947.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $1.430 billion at December 31, 2018, a 50.9% increase. Loans held for sale decreased $16.5 million, or 22.2%, during 2018 which is primarily related to the timing of selling residential and commercial real estate loans. Securities increased $51.2 million, or 26.1%. Included in these changes is growth from our acquisition of Athens which included $473.0 million in total assets, primarily made up of $344.8 million in loans and $67.4 million in securities. Total liabilities increased $512.0 million, or 42.8%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Deposits increased from $1.120 billion at December 31, 2017 to $1.570 billion at December 31, 2018, a 40.2% increase. We increased our Federal Home Loan Bank advances $55.0 million, or 78.6%, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 to help fund loan growth. Total liabilities and deposits from our Athens acquisition were $411.4 million and $404.5 million, respectively. 2017 compared to 2016 Total assets increased $10.7 million, or 0.8%, from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Loans and leases grew from $935.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $947.5 million at December 31, 2017, a 1.3% increase. Loans held for sale increased $32.0 million, or 75.9%, during 2017 as we implemented a new line of business related to originating and selling commercial real estate loans. These increases were offset by a decrease in securities of $32.8 million, or 14.3%, as we sold out of lower yielding securities to fund loan growth. Total liabilities increased $3.0 million, or 0.3%, from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Deposits decreased from $1.129 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.120 billion at December 31, 2017, a 0.8% decrease, due primarily to decreases in money market deposits. Growth in non-interest bearing deposits was $104.0 million between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, or 52.6%, as we continue to become the primary bank for our customers. We increased our Federal Home Loan Bank advances $15.0 million, or 27.3%, from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 to help fund loan growth. Investment Securities The primary purpose of our investment portfolio is to provide another source of interest income, as well as liquidity management. In managing the composition of the balance sheet, we seek a balance between earnings sources and credit and liquidity considerations. We manage our investment portfolio according to a written investment policy approved by our board of directors. Balances in our investment portfolio are subject to change over time based on our funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credit, and are maintained at levels we believe are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities, all with varying contractual maturities. However, these maturities do not necessarily represent the expected life of the securities as some of these securities may be called or paid down without penalty prior to their stated maturities. The investment portfolio is regularly reviewed by the Asset Liability Management committee, or ALCO, of the bank to ensure an appropriate risk and return profile as well as for adherence to the investment policy. 48 Our investment portfolio totaled $247.5 million, $196.4 million and $229.2 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. Excluding investment securities acquired in our acquisition of Athens, our investment portfolio has trended down over the past several years as we have redeployed these funds into higher-earning loans. See “Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our investment securities. The following table presents the fair value of our securities as of December 31, 2018 by their stated maturities (this maturity schedule excludes security prepayment and call features), as well as the weighted average yields for each maturity range.

Associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance. The composition of gross loans and leases at December 31 for each of the past five years and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate - owner occupied $ 141,864 9.9 % $ 101,132 10.7 % $ 106,735 11.4 % $ 108,132 13.4 % $ 93,096 13.0 % Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied 408,582 28.6 % 249,490 26.3 % 195,587 20.9 % $ 143,065 17.7 % $ 126,697 17.7 % Consumer real estate 253,562 17.7 % 102,581 10.8 % 97,015 10.4 % 93,785 11.6 % 82,167 11.5 % Construction and land development 174,670 12.2 % 82,586 8.7 % 94,491 10.1 % 52,522 6.5 % 46,193 6.5 % Commercial and industrial 404,600 28.3 % 373,248 39.4 % 379,620 40.5 % 353,442 43.6 % 332,914 46.6 % Consumer 25,615 1.8 % 6,862 0.7 % 5,974 0.6 % 8,668 1.1 % 7,910 1.1 % Other 21,002 1.5 % 31,983 3.4 % 56,796 6.1 % 50,197 6.2 % 25,615 3.6 % Total gross loans and leases $ 1,429,895 100.0 % $ 947,882 100.0 % $ 936,218 100.0 % $ 809,811 100.0 % $ 714,592 100.0 % Over the past five years, we have experienced significant growth in our loan portfolio. During 2016 and continuing through 2018, we recognized growth in the construction and land development and commercial real estate loan classifications reflecting the development of the Nashville MSA in which we operate. The acquisition of Athens increased all loan classifications and provided further diversity in our loan portfolio through more consumer oriented loan products. 49 Our primary focus has been on commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending, which constituted 67% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. Although we expect continued growth with respect to our loan portfolio, we do not expect any significant changes over the foreseeable future in the composition of our loan portfolio or in our emphasis on commercial lending. Our loan growth since inception has been reflective of the markets we serve. The commercial real estate category includes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans which are similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the affiliated business rather than on the valuation and cash flows of the real estate from unaffiliated tenants. Since 2009, our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios have continued to experience strong growth, primarily due to implementation of our relationship-based banking model and the success of our relationship managers in transitioning commercial banking relationships from other local financial institutions and in competing for new business from attractive small to mid-sized commercial clients. Many of our larger commercial clients have lengthy relationships with members of our senior management team or our relationship managers that date back to their employment by other financial institutions. The repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table details maturities and sensitivity to interest rate changes for our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. December 31, 2018 Due in 1 year or less Due in 1-5 years Due after 5 years Total Commercial real estate $ 57,749 $ 301,993 $ 190,704 $ 550,446 Consumer real estate 13,477 32,179 207,906 253,562 Construction and land development 47,404 87,562 39,704 174,670 Commercial and industrial 92,260 265,202 47,138 404,600 Consumer 6,101 19,185 329 25,615 Other 2,640 12,368 5,994 21,002 Total gross loans $ 219,631 $ 718,489 $ 491,775 $ 1,429,895 Interest rate sensitivity Fixed interest rates 30,512 376,291 200,028 606,831 Floating or adjustable interest rates 189,119 342,198 291,747 823,064 Total gross loans $ 219,631 $ 718,489 $ 491,775 $ 1,429,895 The information presented in the table above is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans, which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms at their maturity. Consequently, we believe that this treatment presents fairly the maturity structure of the loan portfolio. Asset Quality One of our key objectives is to maintain a high level of asset quality in our loan portfolio. We utilize disciplined and thorough underwriting processes that collaboratively engage our seasoned and experienced business bankers, credit underwriters and portfolio managers in the analysis of each loan request. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ scaled review of loan originations that may involve senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors. In addition, we have adopted underwriting guidelines to be followed by our lending officers that require senior management review of proposed extensions of credit exceeding certain thresholds. When delinquencies exist, we monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. Our loan review procedures include approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors of our bank, an independent loan review, approval of larger credit relationships by our bank’s Credit Committee and loan quality documentation procedures. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to the risk that our loan portfolio will be subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. 50 We target small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of such businesses and other consumers and high net worth individuals as loan clients. Because of their size, these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive or economic pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness. If loan losses occur at a level where the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We use an independent consulting firm to review our loans for quality in addition to the reviews that may be conducted internally and by bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process. Our bank has procedures and processes in place intended to assess whether losses exceed the potential amounts documented in our bank’s impairment analyses and to reduce potential losses in the remaining performing loans within our loan portfolio. These procedures and processes include the following: • we monitor the past due and overdraft reports on a weekly basis to identify deterioration as early as possible and the placement of identified loans on the watch list; • we perform quarterly credit reviews for all watch list/classified loans, including formulation of action plans. When a workout is not achievable, we move to collection/foreclosure proceedings to obtain control of the underlying collateral as rapidly as possible to minimize the deterioration of collateral and/or the loss of its value; • we require updated financial information, global inventory aging and interest carry analysis where appropriate for existing borrowers to help identify potential future loan payment problems; and • we generally limit loans for new construction to established builders and developers that have an established record of turning their inventories, and we restrict our funding of undeveloped lots and land. Our bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Our bank analyzes loans individually by classifying each loan as to credit risk. This analysis includes all commercial loans and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000, individually. This analysis is performed on a regular basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least a semi-annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the risk rating of each loan in the sample. See “Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” for a table that provides the risk category of loans by applicable class of loans. Non-Performing Loans and Assets Information summarizing non-performing assets, including non-accrual loans follows. December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Non-accrual loans $ 2,078 $ 2,695 $ 3,619 $ 2,689 $ 7,738 Troubled debt restructurings 1,391 1,206 1,272 125 2,618 Loans past due greater than 89 days and still accruing 214 231 — — — Non-performing loans 2,078 2,695 3,619 2,689 7,738 Foreclosed real estate 988 — — 216 575 Non-performing assets $ 3,066 $ 2,695 $ 3,619 $ 2,905 $ 8,313 Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans 0.15 % 0.28 % 0.39 % 0.33 % 1.09 % Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets 0.16 % 0.20 % 0.27 % 0.24 % 0.74 % 51 The balance of non-performing assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. We have established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on loans (that is, place the loans on non-accrual status) after they have become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loans are considered to be well-collateralized and are in the process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In addition, a loan will not be placed on non-accrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of all principal and interest is not expected in a timely manner. Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against interest income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. If we believe that a loan will not be collected in full, we will increase the allowance for loan losses to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on non-accrual loans are applied directly to principal. As of December 31, 2018, there were not any loans, outside of those included in the table above, that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with present repayment terms. Due to the weakening credit status of a borrower, we may elect to formally restructure certain loans to facilitate a repayment plan that seeks to minimize the potential losses, if any, that we might incur. The effect of these changes is assessed to determine if the loan should be classified as a Troubled Debt Restructure. Loans that have been restructured that are on non-accruing status as of the date of restructuring, are included in the nonperforming loan balances as discussed above and are classified as impaired loans. Loans that have been restructured that are on accrual status as of the restructure date are not included in nonperforming loans; however, such loans are still considered impaired. Allowance for Loan Losses (allowance) Our allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. We determine the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio. Increases in the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to our allowance. The judgments and estimates associated with our allowance determination are described under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above and in Notes 1 and 4 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” The following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods and dates indicated. Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Total loans outstanding, net of unearned income $ 1,429,794 $ 947,537 $ 935,251 $ 808,396 $ 713,077 Average loans outstanding, net of unearned income 1,134,836 987,710 888,541 744,151 682,218 Allowance for loan and lease losses at beginning of period 13,721 11,634 10,132 11,282 8,459 Charge-offs: Commercial real estate — — 350 — 92 Consumer real estate — — — 173 57 Construction and land development — — — — — Commercial and industrial 4,831 12,769 956 3,033 816 Consumer 84 — 146 — 182 Other 39 — — — — Total charge-offs 4,954 12,769 1,452 3,206 1,147 Recoveries: Commercial real estate 22 9 52 31 — Consumer real estate 4 — — 68 21 Construction and land development — — — — — Commercial and industrial 395 1,865 23 299 52 Consumer 75 112 50 7 28 Other 8 — — — — Total recoveries 504 1,986 125 405 101 Net charge-offs 4,450 10,783 1,327 2,801 1,046 Provision for loan and lease losses 2,842 12,870 2,829 1,651 3,869 Allowance for loan and lease losses at period end $ 12,113 $ 13,721 $ 11,634 $ 10,132 $ 11,282 Allowance for loan and lease losses to period end loans 0.85 % 1.45 % 1.24 % 1.25 % 1.58 % Net charge-offs to YTD average loans 0.39 % 1.09 % 0.15 % 0.38 % 0.15 % 52 See “Provision for Loan losses” above for discussion of the changes in the provision for loan losses. While no portion of our allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following tables represent management’s allocation of our allowance to specific loan categories for the periods indicated. December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial real estate $ 3,309 27.3 % $ 3,324 24.2 % $ 2,655 22.8 % $ 2,879 28.4 % $ 1,535 13.6 % Consumer real estate 1,005 8.3 % 1,063 7.7 % 1,013 8.7 % 968 9.6 % 621 5.5 % Construction and land development 2,431 20.1 % 1,628 11.9 % 1,574 13.5 % 914 9.0 % 408 3.6 % Commercial and industrial 5,036 41.6 % 7,209 52.5 % 5,618 48.3 % 4,693 46.3 % 8,540 75.7 % Consumer 105 0.9 % 91 0.7 % 76 0.7 % 103 1.0 % 75 0.7 % Other 227 1.9 % 406 3.0 % 698 6.0 % 575 5.7 % 103 0.9 % Total allowance for loan and lease losses $ 12,113 100.0 % $ 13,721 100.0 % $ 11,634 100.0 % $ 10,132 100.0 % $ 11,282 100.0 % Changes in the allocation of the allowance from year to year in various categories are influenced by the level of net charge-offs in respective categories and other factors including, but not limited to, an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and trends, risk allocations tied to specific loans or groups of loans and changes in qualitative allocations. Management believes that allocations for each loan category are reasonable and reflective of risk inherent in the portfolio. Deposits Client deposits are the primary funding source for our loan growth. The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on deposits for each of the following categories for the periods indicated. Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Types of Deposits: Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 262,280 0.00 % $ 232,687 0.00 % $ 189,270 0.00 % Interest-bearing demand deposits 330,952 1.26 % 301,411 0.81 % 269,113 0.55 % Money market accounts 409,055 1.33 % 375,688 0.85 % 443,378 0.64 % Savings accounts 14,997 0.09 % 2,952 0.15 % 2,495 0.15 % Time deposits, $100,000 and over 177,366 1.76 % 155,788 1.13 % 149,674 0.89 % Time deposits, less than $100,000 50,395 1.63 % 39,104 1.76 % 44,207 1.69 % Total deposits $ 1,245,045 1.09 % $ 1,107,630 0.73 % $ 1,098,137 0.59 % Total average deposits increased 12.4% in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased 0.9% in 2017 compared to 2016. Much of the growth in deposits in 2018 is related to our acquisition of Athens. However, we have been able to increase average noninterest-bearing demand deposits each year as we focus on building and expanding client relationships. The Nashville MSA is a competitive market for deposits and we experienced some run-off in rate sensitive deposits during 2017 and 2018. The following table presents the maturities of our certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2018. December 31, 2018 Three months or less Over three through six months Over six through twelve months Over twelve months Total $100,000 or more $ 125,849 $ 33,303 $ 47,725 $ 61,117 $ 267,994 Less than $100,000 15,389 13,270 19,303 32,471 80,433 Total $ 141,238 $ 46,573 $ 67,028 $ 93,588 $ 348,427 53 Capital Adequacy As of December 31, 2018, CapStar Financial’s capital ratios were as follows. Well Capitalized December 31, 2018 Total risk-based capital 10.0% 12.8% Tier 1 risk-based capital 8.0% 12.1% Common equity tier 1 capital 6.5% 11.6% Tier 1 leverage 5.0% 11.1% On September 21, 2016, the SEC declared effective our registration statement on Form S-1 registering shares of our common stock. On September 27, 2016, we completed the initial public offering of 2,972,750 shares of our common stock. Of the 2,972,750 shares sold, 1,688,049 shares were sold by us and 1,284,701 shares were sold by certain selling shareholders. Of the 1,284,701 shares sold by certain selling shareholders, 731,707 were from preferred shares converted to common shares and 79,166 from the cashless exercise of 250,000 common share warrants. We received net proceeds of approximately $21.6 million from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders. See Note 15 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to our capital position. Market and Liquidity Risk Management Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our ALCO is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure an acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. Interest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis Managing interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity while attempting to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer requirements. We use earnings at risk, or EAR, simulations to assess the impact of changing rates on earnings under a variety of scenarios and time horizons. The simulation model is designed to reflect the dynamics of interest earning assets, interest bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments. These simulations utilize both instantaneous and parallel changes in the level of interest rates, as well as non-parallel changes such as changing slopes and twists of the yield curve. Static simulation models are based on current exposures and assume a constant balance sheet with no new growth. Dynamic simulation models are also utilized that rely on detailed assumptions regarding changes in existing lines of business, new business, and changes in management and client behavior. By estimating the effects of interest rate increases and decreases, the model can reveal approximate interest rate risk exposure. The simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in interest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and does not indicate actual expected results. At December 31, 2018, our EAR static simulation results indicated that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to parallel shifts in interest rates. This indicates that our assets generally reprice faster than our liabilities, which results in a favorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates increase and an unfavorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates decline. Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity and decay rates, and key rate drivers. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may, and most likely will, differ from our static EAR results. In addition, static EAR results do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client behavior. For example, as part of our asset/liability management strategy, management has the ability to increase asset duration and/or decrease liability duration in order to reduce asset sensitivity, or to decrease asset duration and/or increase liability duration in order to increase asset sensitivity. 54 The following table illustrates the results of our EAR analysis to determine the extent to which our net interest income over the next 12 months would change if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased by the specified amounts. Net interest income change Increase 200bp 0.3% Increase 100bp 0.0 Decrease 100bp (2.9) Decrease 200bp (10.3) Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. To manage liquidity risk, management has established a comprehensive management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is fully integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; appropriate strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems (including assessments of the current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are commensurate with the complexity and business activities of the Bank; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; adequate levels of highly liquid marketable securities free of legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that can be used to meet liquidity needs in stressful situations; comprehensive contingency funding plans that sufficiently address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes sufficient to determine the adequacy of the institution’s liquidity risk management process. The role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors’ withdrawal and borrowers’ credit demands while at the same time optimizing financial results within our corporate guidelines. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of those funds. Liquidity is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, investment securities available-for-sale, various lines of credit available to us, and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally deposits. Our most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, available-for-sale marketable investment securities and federal funds sold. The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was $243.8 million at December 31, 2018. We pledge portions of our investment securities portfolio to secure public fund deposits, derivative positions and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. At December 31, 2018, total investment securities pledged for these purposes comprised 69% of the estimated fair value of the entire investment portfolio, leaving $76.1 million of unpledged securities. We have a large base of non-maturity customer deposits, defined as demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts. At December 31, 2018, such deposits totaled $1.2 billion and represented 78% of our total deposits. Other sources of funds available to meet daily needs include FHLB advances. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, the Company has access to credit products offered by the FHLB. The Company views these borrowings as a low cost alternative to other time deposits. At December 31, 2018, available credit from the FHLB totaled $71.9 million. Additionally, we had available federal funds purchased lines with correspondent banks totaling $110.0 million at December 31, 2018. The principal source of cash for CapStar Financial is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was able to pay up to $22.2 million in dividends to CapStar Financial without regulatory approval subject to the ongoing capital requirements of the Bank. Accordingly, management believes that our funding sources are at sufficient levels to satisfy our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 55 Contractual Obligations The following table presents additional information about contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, which by their terms have contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent to December 31, 2018. Contractual Obligations: Due in 1 year or less Due after 1 through 3 years Due after 3 through 5 years Due after 5 years Total FHLB advances $ 125,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 125,000 Certificates of deposits $100,000 or more 206,877 48,995 12,015 107 267,994 Certificates of deposits less than $100,000 47,962 23,972 8,347 152 80,433 Operating leases 1,538 3,106 2,855 8,821 16,320 Total $ 381,377 $ 76,073 $ 23,217 $ 9,080 $ 489,747 Borrowings The following table outlines our sources of short-term borrowed funds during the year ended December 31, 2018, and the amount outstanding at the end of each period, the maximum amount, average amount and average interest rate that we paid for each borrowing source during the period. The maximum month end balance represents the high indebtedness of borrowed funds at any time during each of the periods shown. Stated period end rates are contractual rates. As of or for the year ended December 31, 2018 Average for the period Ending balance Stated period end rate Maximum month end balance Balance Rate Short-term borrowed funds: Short-term FHLB advances $ 125,000 2.43%-2.89% $ 150,000 $ 99,000 2.07 % Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our clients. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold. We enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon clients maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. In the event that the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the client. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. We minimize our exposure to loss under loan commitments and standby letters of credit by subjecting them to the same credit approval and monitoring procedures as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses. The effect on our revenue, expenses, cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. 56 Our off-balance sheet arrangements are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated. Contract or notional amount December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 707,675 $ 584,494 $ 508,990 Standby letters of credit 12,273 11,552 10,886 Total $ 719,948 $ 596,046 $ 519,876 Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Report includes the following financial measures that have been prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“non-GAAP financial measures”): tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible common equity per share. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enable a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business, and (iii) allow investors to evaluate the Company’s performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators; however, the Company acknowledges that its non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and they are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. The following table presents a reconciliation of tangible common equity, tangible common equity to total tangible assets and tangible book value per share of common stock to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Impact of Inflation The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. 57 ITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting under PCAOB standards. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Elliott Davis, LLC We have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 include CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. and it’s wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank (the “Bank”, together referred to as the “Company”). Significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. On February 5, 2016, CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. acquired all of the Bank’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, preferred stock, common stock options and warrants, and the Bank became the wholly owned subsidiary of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (the “Share Exchange”). The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is capitalized as goodwill. Under this method, all identifiable assets acquired, including purchased loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The Company typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition agreement. The value of shares of common stock issued is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the acquisition. Nature of Operations Through the Bank, the Company provides full banking services to consumer and corporate customers located primarily in Tennessee. The Bank operates under a state bank charter and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a state member bank, the Bank is subject to regulations of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Initial Public Offering On September 21, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) declared effective our registration statement on Form S-1 registering shares of our common stock. On September 27, 2016, we completed the initial public offering of 2,972,750 shares of our common stock. Of the 2,972,750 shares sold, 1,688,049 shares were sold by us and 1,284,701 shares were sold by certain selling shareholders. Of the 1,284,701 shares sold by certain selling shareholders, 731,707 were from shares of preferred stock converted to shares of common stock and 79,166 from the cashless exercise of 250,000 common stock warrants. We received net proceeds of approximately $21.6 million from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, determination of impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, the valuation of our investment portfolio and deferred tax assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds sold are purchased and sold for one-day periods. The Company maintains deposits in excess of the federal insurance amounts with other financial institutions. Management makes deposits only with financial institutions it considers to be financially sound. 66 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Securities The Bank accounts for securities under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities . Under the provisions of FASB ASC 320, securities are to be classified in three categories and accounted for as follows: Securities Held to Maturity - Debt securities are classified as held to maturity securities when the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Trading Securities - Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. No securities have been classified as trading securities. Securities Available for Sale - Debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities. Securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Realized gains and losses from the sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific-identification method. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and any collateral underlying the relevant security. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: (1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and (2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings. Loans Held for Sale Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. Realized gains and losses are recognized when legal title of the loan has transferred to the investor and sales proceeds have been received and are reflected in the accompanying statement of income in gain on sale of loans, net of related costs such as commission expenses. The Company does not securitize mortgage loans. If the Company sells loans with servicing rights retained, the carrying value of the mortgage loan sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. Tri-Net Fees Tri-Net fees represent a line of business, implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, which originates, with the intent to sell, commercial real estate loans to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Realized gains and losses are recognized when legal title of the loan has transferred to the investor and sales proceeds have been received and are reflected in the accompanying statements of income in Tri-Net fees, net of related costs such as commission expenses. Loans that have not been sold at period end are classified as held for sale on the balance sheet and recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. 67 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Loans The Company has six classes of loans for financial reporting purposes: commercial real estate, consumer real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, consumer and other. The appropriate classification is determined based on the underlying collateral utilized to secure each loan. Commercial real estate loans are categorized as such based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial real estate also includes owner occupied commercial real estate. Consumer real estate consists primarily of 1-4 family residential properties including home equity lines of credit. Construction and land development loans include loans where the repayment is dependent on the successful completion and operation and/or sale of the related real estate project. Construction and land development loans include 1-4 family construction projects and commercial construction endeavors such as warehouses, apartments, office and retail space and land acquisition and development. Commercial and industrial loans include loans to business enterprises issued for commercial, industrial and/or other professional purposes. Consumer loans include all loans issued to individuals not included in the consumer real estate class. Other loans include all loans not included in the classes of loans above and leases. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans and any accrued interest is typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful and collection is highly questionable. Amortization of deferred loan fees is discontinued when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Under the cash-basis method, interest income is recorded when the payment is received in cash. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Loans can also be returned to accrual status when they become well secured and in the process of collection. Acquired Loans Acquired loans are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value of acquired loans is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on assumptions regarding the amount and timing of principal and interest payments, estimated prepayments, estimated default rates, estimated loss severity in the event of defaults, and current market rates. Estimated credit losses are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not recorded on the acquisition date. An acquired loan is considered purchased credit impaired when there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. 68 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually or aggregated into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics such as loan type and risk rating. The Company estimates the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan or pool, and the expected cash flows in excess of amount paid (fair value) is recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool (accretable yield). The excess of the loan’s or pool’s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (nonaccretable difference). Over the life of the loan or pool, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded as a provision for loan losses. If the present value of expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income. Acquired non-impaired loans are recorded at their initial fair value and adjusted for subsequent advances, pay downs, amortization or accretion of any premium or discount on purchase, charge-offs and additional provisioning that may be required. Allowance for Loan losses The allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) is maintained at a level that management believes to be adequate to absorb expected loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Quarterly, the Company estimates the allowance required using peer group loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. The Company’s historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions due to the Company’s limited loss history. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The Company also considers the results of the external independent loan review when assessing the adequacy of the allowance and incorporates relevant loan review results in the loan impairment and overall adequacy of allowance determinations. Furthermore, regulatory agencies periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to record adjustments to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. Additional considerations are included in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance based on the continuous review conducted by relationship managers and credit department personnel. The Company’s loan policy requires that each customer relationship wherein total exposure exceeds $1.5 million be subject to a formal credit review at least annually. Should these reviews identify potential collection concerns, appropriate adjustments to the allowance may be made. The allowance consists of specific and general components as discussed below. While the allowance consists of separate components, these terms are primarily used to describe a process. Both portions of the allowance are available to provide for inherent losses in the entire portfolio. Specific Component The specific component relates to loans that are individually determined to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 69 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Loans meeting any of the following criteria are individually evaluated for impairment: risk rated substandard (as defined in Note 4), on non-accrual status or past due greater than 90 days. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral less costs to sell if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Changes to the valuation allowance are recorded as a component of the provision for loan losses. TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. TDRs are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s effective rate at inception. If a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. General Component The general component of the allowance for loan losses covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Large groups of homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not included in the separately identified impairment disclosures. The general allowance component also includes loans that are individually identified for impairment evaluation but are not considered impaired. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. Due to the Company’s limited loss history, the historical loss experience is based on the actual loss history by class of loan for comparable peer institutions. The Company utilized a 28 quarter look-back period as of December 31, 2016 and a 33 quarter look-back period as of December 31, 2017. Subsequently, the Company increased its look-back period for a total of 37 quarters as of December 31, 2018. In the current economic environment, management believes the extension of the look-back period was necessary in order to capture sufficient loss observations to develop a reliable loss estimate of credit losses. This extension of the historical look-back period to capture the historical loss experience of peer banks was applied to all classes and segments of our loan portfolio. The actual loss experience is supplemented with other environmental factors that capture changes in trends, conditions, and other relevant factors that may cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from historical loss experience. The allocation for environmental factors is by nature subjective. These amounts represent estimated probable inherent credit losses, which exist but have not been captured in the historical loss experience. The environmental factors include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, experience of lending management, volume and severity of past due loans, quality of the loan review system, value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, concentrations, and other external factors. 70 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Servicing Rights When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in other noninterest income. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances are reported with other noninterest income on the income statement. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement within other noninterest income, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal; or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income. Net servicing fees totaled $102,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no servicing fees for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. Transfers of Financial Assets Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Bank, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method based on the shorter of the asset lives or the expected lease terms. Useful lives for premises and equipment range from three to thirty-nine years. These assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value. The Company is the lessee with respect to several office locations. All such leases are accounted for as operating leases within the accompanying financial statements. These leases include rent escalation clauses. The Company expenses the costs associated with these escalating payments over the life of the expected lease term using the straight-line method. As of December 31, 2018, the deferred liability associated with these escalating rentals was approximately $639,000 and is included in other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. Bank Owned Life Insurance The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase The Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase at a specified future date. Such repurchase agreements are considered financing arrangements and, accordingly, the obligation to repurchase assets sold is reflected as a liability in the balance sheets of the Bank. Repurchase agreements are collateralized by debt securities which are owned and under the control of the Bank. 71 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected October 31st as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the balance sheet. Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to ten years. Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned (“OREO”) includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and are recorded at estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Valuation adjustments required at foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, additional losses resulting from the periodic revaluation of the property are charged to other real estate expense. Costs of operating and maintaining the properties and any gains or losses recognized on disposition are also included in other real estate expense. Improvements made to properties are capitalized if the expenditures are expected to be recovered upon the sale of the properties. Restricted Equity Securities The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on an assessment of the ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System, and as such, holds stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“Federal Reserve Bank”). Federal Reserve Bank stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted equity security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Income Taxes Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company’s tax returns remain open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS and various states for the years ended December 31, 2015 through 2018. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest, reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards with performance vesting criteria, anticipated performance is projected to determine the number of awards expected to vest, and the corresponding aggregate expense is adjusted to reflect the elapsed portion of the performance period. 72 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $383,000, $310,000 and $252,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has entered into off-balance-sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received. Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps (“swaps”) to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these arrangements to meet customer needs, the Bank enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize risk to the Bank. These swaps are derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments. The Bank also has forward starting cash flow hedges to manage its future interest rate exposure. These derivative contracts have been designated as hedges and, as such, changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Bank prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges. The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness, along with support for management’s assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion, if any, would be recognized in current period earnings. The Bank discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminates, or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended. When hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as non-interest income. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings. Cash flows resulting from the derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as hedges are classified in the cash flow statement in the same category as the cash flows of the items being hedged. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on securities transferred to held to maturity and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges which are also recognized as separate components of equity. The Bank’s policy is to release the income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when the item is realized. Fair Value Measurements Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. 73 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Restriction on Cash Balances Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Act requires that banks maintain reserve balances with their applicable Federal Reserve Bank based principally on the type and amount of their deposits. The Bank was required to have a reserve balance of $63,890,000, $43,940,000, and $40,902,000 at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The reserve balance that the Bank must maintain at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is included in interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Subsequent Events The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure through March 15, 2019, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Income Per Common Share Basic net income per share available to common stockholders (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is attributable to convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of outstanding convertible preferred stock, common stock options and warrants is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. No antidilutive stock options were excluded from calculation for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or December 31, 2016. The following is a summary of the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation for each of the following years (in thousands except share data): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Basic net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 9,655 $ 1,501 $ 9,097 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 13,277,614 11,280,580 9,328,236 Basic net income per share $ 0.73 $ 0.13 $ 0.98 Diluted net income per share calculation: Numerator – Net income $ 9,655 $ 1,501 $ 9,097 Denominator – Average common shares outstanding 13,277,614 11,280,580 9,328,236 Dilutive shares contingently issuable 1,202,733 1,522,931 1,883,790 Average diluted common shares outstanding 14,480,347 12,803,511 11,212,026 Diluted net income per share $ 0.67 $ 0.12 $ 0.81 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance was effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company applied the guidance using a modified retrospective approach. The Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income. The scope of the guidance explicitly excludes net interest income as well as many other revenues for financial assets and liabilities including loans, leases, securities, and derivatives. Accordingly, the majority of our revenues will not be affected. The Company has performed an assessment of our revenue contracts related to revenue streams that are within the scope of the standard. Our accounting policies will not change materially since the principles of revenue recognition from the ASU are largely consistent with existing guidance and current practices applied by our businesses. We did not identify material changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition. 74 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Company records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic 606”). Under Topic 606, the Company must identify the contract with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Significant revenue has not been recognized in the current reporting period that results from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. The Company’s primary sources of revenue are derived from interest and dividends earned on loans, investment securities, and other financial instruments that are not within the scope of Topic 606. The Company has evaluated the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income was not necessary. The Company generally fully satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are rendered and the transaction prices are typically fixed; charged either on a periodic basis or based on activity. Our accounting policies will not change materially since the principles of revenue recognition form the Accounting Standards Update are largely consistent with existing guidance and current practices applied by our business. A description of the Company’s revenue streams accounted for under Topic 606 follows: Treasury management and other deposit service charges: The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction based fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer’s request. Account maintenance fees are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies its performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer’s account balance. Interchange income: Included in other noninterest income are interchange fees, which the Company earns from debit cardholder transactions conducted through various payment networks. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing series provided to the cardholder. Gains/Losses on Sales of OREO: The Company records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Company finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Company assesses whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligation under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Company adjusts the transaction price and related gain (loss) on sale if a significant financing component is present. ASU 2016-02, Leases In February 2016, the FASB amended the Leases topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to revise certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing transactions. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the guidance using the modified retrospective method and practical expedients for transition. The practical expedients allow the Company to largely account for our existing leases consistent with current guidance except for the incremental balance sheet recognition for lessees. The Company evaluated the new guidance and its impact on the Company’s financial statements. Based on leases outstanding at December 31, 2018, the impact of adoption on January 1, 2019 was recording a lease liability of approximately $13.4 million, a right-of-use asset of approximately $12.8 million, and elimination of deferred rent of approximately $0.6 million. 75 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all organizations for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company will apply the amendments to the ASU through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. While early adoption is permitted beginning in first quarter 2019, we do not expect to elect that option. We are evaluating the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In addition to our allowance for loan losses, we will also record an allowance for credit losses on debt securities instead of applying the impairment model currently utilized. The amount of the adjustments will be impacted by each portfolio's composition and credit quality at the adoption date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB amended the Goodwill and Other Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment for public business entities and other entities that have goodwill reported in their financial statements and have not elected the private company alternative for the subsequent measurement of goodwill. The amendment removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The effective date and transition requirements for the technical corrections will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities In August 2017, the FASB amended the requirements of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard December 1, 2017. However, there was no material effect on the financial statements. ASU 2018-02, Income Statement: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2018, the FASB Issued (2018-02), Income Statement (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which allows Companies to reclassify the stranded effects in other comprehensive income to retained earnings as a result of the change in the tax rates under the Tax Reform Act. The Company has opted to early adopt this pronouncement by retrospective application to each period in which the effect of the change in the tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. The Company made an election to reclassify income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act, amounting to approximately $259,000, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The impact of the reclassification from other comprehensive income to retained earnings is included in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity. ASU 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation In June 2018, the FASB amended the Compensation—Stock Compensation Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The amendments are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than an entity’s adoption date of Topic 606. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements. 76 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 2 – ACQUISITIONS On October 1, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Athens Bancshares Company (“Athens”), the bank holding company for Athens Federal Community Bank, National Association (“Athens Federal”). Under the terms of the acquisition, Athens common shareholders received 2.864 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of Athens common stock. With the acquisition, the Company further expanded its franchise into the East Tennessee market. Athens’ results of operations were included in the Company’s results beginning October 1, 2018. Acquisition related costs of $9,803,000 are included in the Company’s income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018. The fair value of the common shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Athens was determined by the closing price of the Company’s common shares immediately preceding the acquisition date. Goodwill of $31,291,000 arising from the acquisition consisted largely of synergies and the cost savings resulting from the combining of the operations of the companies. Goodwill associated with Athens acquisition is not amortizable for book or tax purposes. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Athens and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date (in thousands): As recorded by Athens Bancshares Initial fair value adjustments Measurement period adjustments As recorded by CapStar Financial Holdings Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,053 $ — $ — $ 12,053 Securities 67,342 84 (a) — 67,426 Loans, gross 349,597 (4,764 ) (b) — 344,833 Allowance for loan losses (4,039 ) 4,039 (c) — — Premises and equipment, net 7,637 1,571 (d) — 9,208 Core deposit intangible 2,758 6,222 (e) — 8,980 Other 29,566 944 (f) — 30,510 Total $ 464,914 $ 8,096 $ — $ 473,010 Liabilities: Deposits $ 404,027 $ 493 (g) $ — $ 404,520 Other 5,363 1,500 (h) — 6,863 Total $ 409,390 $ 1,993 $ — $ 411,383 Net identifiable assets acquired $ 61,627 Total cost of acquisition: Value of stock issued $ 86,538 Value of rolled stock options 6,380 Total cost of acquisition $ 92,918 $ 92,918 Goodwill recorded related to acquisition $ 31,291 ________________________________________________________ (a) The amount represents the fair value adjustment of securities that were subsequently sold. (b) The amount represents the adjustment of the net book value of Athens’ loans to their estimated fair value based on interest rates and expected cash flows at the date of acquisition. (c) The amount represents the removal of Athens’ existing allowance for loan losses. (d) The amount represents the adjustment of the net book value of Athens’ premises and equipment to their estimated fair value. (e) The amount represents the net adjustment of removing Athens’ existing core deposit intangible from prior acquisitions and recording the fair value of the core deposit intangible representing the intangible value of the deposit base acquired and the fair value of the customer relationship. (f) The amount represents the net adjustment of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights acquired and the deferred tax asset recognized on the fair value adjustments on Athens acquired assets and assumed liabilities. (g) The amount represents the adjustment necessary because the weighted average interest rate of Athens’ time deposits exceeded the cost of similar funding at the time of acquisition. The fair value adjustment will be amortized to reduce future interest expense over the life of the portfolio. (h) The amount represents the liability assumed in connection with the merger agreement whereby the Company will make a $1,500,000 charitable contribution to the Athens Foundation over a three year period. 77 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of the Company and Athens as if the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2017, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of the core deposit intangible, and related income tax effects. The pro forma financial information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have occurred had the Company and Athens constituted a single entity during such periods (in thousands, except share data): Pro forma combined twelve months ended December 31, 2018 Pro forma combined twelve months ended December 31, 2017 Net interest income $ 66,935 $ 59,148 Noninterest income 20,692 17,540 Total revenue 87,627 76,688 Net income 21,167 5,851 Per share information: Basic net income per share of common stock $ 1.24 $ 0.36 Diluted net income per share of common stock $ 1.14 $ 0.32 NOTE 3 – INVESTMENT SECURITIES Investment securities have been classified in the balance sheet according to management’s intent.

The transfers of the securities into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category were made at fair value at the date of transfer. The unrealized holding loss at the date of the transfer continues to be reported in a separate component of shareholders’ equity and is being amortized over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of the premiums and discounts. During the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately $41,665,000 of held to maturity securities were transferred to the available for sale category. The Company was able to make the transfer due to early adoption of ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The transfers of the securities into the available for sale category from the held to maturity category were made at fair value at the date of transfer. 78 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The amortized cost and fair value of debt and equity securities at December 31, 2018, by contractual maturity, are shown below (in thousands).

Securities with a market value of $171,542,000 and $111,970,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were pledged to collateralize public deposits, derivative positions and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of shareholders’ equity.

The amount of the impairment of available for sale securities related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other things, the length of time and the extent 79 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The unrealized losses shown above are primarily due to increases in market rates over the yields available at the time of purchase of the underlying securities and not credit quality. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2018. There were no other-than-temporary impairments for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. NOTE 4 – LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES Loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Commercial real estate $ 550,446 $ 350,622 Consumer real estate 253,562 102,581 Construction and land development 174,670 82,586 Commercial and industrial 404,600 373,248 Consumer 25,615 6,862 Other 21,002 31,983 Total 1,429,895 947,882 Less net unearned income (101 ) (345 ) Total loans 1,429,794 947,537 Allowance for loan losses (12,113 ) (13,721 ) Total loans, net $ 1,417,681 $ 933,816 At December 31, 2018, variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $827,491,000 and $602,404,000, respectively. At December 31, 2017, variable-rate and fixed-rate loans totaled $608,128,000 and $339,754,000, respectively. The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes all commercial loans, and consumer relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $500,000, individually and assigns each loan a risk rating. This analysis is performed on a continual basis by the relationship managers and credit department personnel. On at least an annual basis an independent party performs a formal credit risk review of a sample of the loan portfolio. Among other things, this review assesses the appropriateness of the loan’s risk rating. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention – A special mention asset possesses deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving of management’s attention. If uncorrected, such weaknesses or deficiencies may expose the Company to an increased risk of loss in the future. Substandard – A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. Doubtful – A doubtful asset has all weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is extremely high, but certain important and reasonable specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset exist, therefore, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined.

This revaluation resulted in a $3.6 million decrease in net deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. 92 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Significant items that gave rise to deferred taxes at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 2,795 $ 3,227 Depreciation — — Net operating loss carryforward 2,002 843 Organization and preopening costs 457 557 Stock-based compensation 835 672 Acquired loans 1,319 124 Acquired deposits 106 22 Nonaccrual interest 75 25 Accrued incentive compensation 97 — Reserve for contingencies 143 496 Accrued contributions 207 169 Unrealized loss on securities available-for-sale 845 193 Unrealized loss on securities held-to-maturity — 4 Cash flow hedge 219 359 Accrued vacation 45 45 Other — 134 Deferred tax assets 9,145 6,870 Deferred tax liabilities: Prepaid expenses 77 134 Depreciation 645 39 Goodwill 81 138 Amortization of core deposit intangible 1,398 6 Other 334 — Deferred tax liabilities 2,535 317 Net deferred tax asset $ 6,610 $ 6,553 At December 31, 2018, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8,561,000, which expire at various dates from 2030 to 2032. Approximately $4,548,000 of the net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets are fully recognized because the benefits are more likely than not to be realized based on management’s estimation of future taxable earnings. There were no significant unrecognized income tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. NOTE 13 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for instruments that are included in the balance sheet. 93 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following table sets forth outstanding financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): Contract or notional amount December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Unused commitments to extend credit $ 707,675 $ 584,494 Standby letters of credit 12,273 11,552 Total $ 719,948 $ 596,046 The Company is party to litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from such litigation and claims as of December 31, 2018, will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company. NOTE 14 – CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Substantially all of the Company’s loans, commitments, and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Company’s market areas. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4 to the financial statements. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions aggregated $89,000,000 and $38,000,000, respectively, in excess of insured limits. NOTE 15 – REGULATORY MATTERS AND RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the Bank is also subject to the regulatory capital requirements of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory – and possibly additional discretionary – actions by regulators that could, in that event, have a material adverse effect on the institutions’ financial statements. The relevant regulations require the Company and the Bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting principles. The capital classifications of the Company and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by their regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Those qualitative judgments could also affect the capital status of the Company and the Bank and the amount of dividends the Company and the Bank may distribute. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Companying Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. Banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, federal banking regulators have established five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company and the Bank were well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Company’s or the Bank’s category. 94 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table (dollars in thousands): Actual Minimum capital requirement (1) Minimum to be well-capitalized (2) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio At December 31, 2018: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 222,030 12.8 % $ 138,336 8.0 % $ N/A N/A CapStar Bank 201,972 11.7 138,294 8.0 172,868 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 209,738 12.1 103,752 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 189,680 11.0 103,721 6.0 138,294 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 200,738 11.6 77,814 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 173,180 10.0 77,791 4.5 112,364 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 209,738 11.1 75,867 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 189,680 10.0 75,828 4.0 94,785 5.0 At December 31, 2017: Total capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. $ 156,176 12.5 % $ 99,932 8.0 % $ N/A N/A CapStar Bank 142,138 11.4 99,928 8.0 124,909 10.0 Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 142,276 11.4 74,949 6.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 128,238 10.3 74,946 6.0 99,928 8.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 133,445 10.7 56,212 4.5 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 111,907 9.0 56,209 4.5 81,191 6.5 Tier I capital to average assets: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. 142,276 10.7 53,218 4.0 N/A N/A CapStar Bank 128,238 9.6 53,215 4.0 66,519 5.0 (1) For the calendar year 2018, the Company was required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of Tier 1 common equity capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 1.875% to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees. (2) For the Company to be well-capitalized, the Bank must be well-capitalized and the Company must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Under Tennessee banking law, the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year without prior approval of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions is limited to the current year’s net income, combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. The Bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that Company holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Based on these regulations, the Bank was eligible to pay $22.2 million and $19.3 million of dividends as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Bank paid the Company $1.2 million of dividends during 2018 and this amount was paid out to shareholders by the Company during 2018. 95 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 16 – NONVOTING AND SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCK WARRANTS Nonvoting Common Stock The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of its common stock as nonvoting common stock. The nonvoting common stock has the same rights and privileges as the common stock other than the nonvoting designation. Under certain conditions, as outlined in the Company’s charter, the nonvoting stock may be converted, on a one-to-one basis, to common stock. In conjunction with the Company’s initial public offering, 79,166 shares of nonvoting common stock were issued and simultaneously converted to common stock on a one-to-one basis as further described under “Warrants” below. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 there were 132,561 shares of nonvoting common stock outstanding. Preferred Stock In conjunction with its initial capital issuance in 2008, the Bank issued 1,609,756 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to certain shareholders. During 2016, coinciding with the Company’s initial public offering, 731,707 preferred shares were converted to common shares. The Series A Preferred Stock contains a liquidation preference and certain antidilution provisions. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock also have certain consent rights with respect to changes to the Company’s charter or bylaws that would materially adversely affect the preferences, rights and powers of such stock and the right to receive certain financial reports. The Series A Preferred Stock is noncumulative, perpetual and, except as otherwise provided below or pursuant to Tennessee law, nonvoting. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock participate equally in dividends paid on the common stock on an as converted basis. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible to nonvoting common stock upon the occurrence of certain underwritten public offerings and certain transfers or proposed transfers by the Company’s organizing shareholders. Warrants In conjunction with the issuance of the 1,609,756 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of such stock were issued 500,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s nonvoting common stock at a purchase price of $10.25 per share. The warrants were exercisable at any time and expired ten years from the date of grant of July 14, 2008. As of December 31, 2018, all of these warrants have been exercised and none of these warrants remain outstanding. As part of the initial capital issuance in 2008, each organizer of the Company (“Organizers”) who became a director of the Company received a warrant to purchase, at the purchase price of $10.00 per share, 10,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. These warrants were issued in compliance with the FDIC’s policy on noncash compensation in recognition of the Organizers considerable contribution of time, expertise, and capital. The Company issued warrants to purchase 60,000 shares of common stock to these organizers. The warrants expired ten years from date of grant of July 14, 2008. As of December 31, 2018, all of these warrants have been exercised and no warrants remain outstanding. In addition, each subscriber for shares who is a Tennessee resident or any entity controlled by a Tennessee resident and invested a minimum of $500,000 in the offering, received a warrant to purchase additional shares of common stock equal to 5% of accepted subscriptions at the purchase price of $10.00 per share. The Company issued warrants to purchase 238,319 shares of common stock to these subscribers. The warrants expired ten years from date of grant of July 14, 2008. As of December 31, 2018, all of these warrants have been exercised and no warrants remain outstanding. 96 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 17 – SHAREHOLDERS’ AGREEMENT On August 22, 2016, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement (the “SARSA”) with certain of its shareholders. Other than with respect to registration rights and rights and obligations with respect to indemnification, the SARSA will remain in effect until June 30, 2018 unless earlier terminated by the shareholders that are party to the SARSA. Among other matters, the SARSA (i) permits Corsair III Financial Services Capital Partners, L.P. and Corsair III Financial Services Offshore 892 Partners, L.P. (the “Corsair Funds”) to recommend one nominee to the Nominating, Governance and Community Affairs Committee of the boards of directors of the Company and our bank for election to such boards, subject to any required regulatory and shareholder approvals, (ii) provides “demand” registration rights to the Corsair Funds and those shareholders, other than the Corsair Funds, that hold, individually or in the aggregate, at least 500,000 shares of registrable securities and (iii) provides “piggyback” registration rights to all shareholders that are parties to the SARSA. Pursuant to the terms of the SARSA, we received a request from certain shareholders party to the SARSA to register 3,652,094 shares of our common stock on a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”) in December 2018. The Registration Statement was filed with the SEC on December 21, 2018. NOTE 18 – STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES During 2008, the board of directors of the Company approved the CapStar Bank 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. Following the formation of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. in 2016, and in connection with the Share Exchange, the outstanding awards of restricted stock and stock options under the CapStar Bank 2008 Stock Incentive Plan were exchanged for similar awards of restricted stock and stock options issued by CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. under the Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which the board of directors adopted in 2016. The Plan provides for the grant of stock-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance awards and restricted stock, to employees, directors and service providers that are subject to forfeiture until vesting conditions have been satisfied by the award recipient under the terms of the award. The Plan is intended to help align the interests of employees and our shareholders and reward our employees for improved Company performance. The Plan reserved 1,569,475 shares of stock for issuance of stock incentives. Stock incentives include both restricted stock and stock option grants. During 2018 the board of directors approved the addition of 400,000 shares of stock for issuance of stock incentives under the Plan. Total shares issuable under the plan are 422,900 at December 31, 2018. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, within salaries and employee benefits for employees, and within other non-interest expense for directors, in the consolidated statements of income as follows (in thousands): For the year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Stock-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 2,079 $ 1,061 $ 842 Less: deferred tax benefit (543 ) (406 ) (322 ) Reduction of net income $ 1,536 $ 655 $ 520 97 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Restricted Shares Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at the issue date. The recipients have the right to vote and receive dividends but cannot sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber the restricted stock until the shares have vested. Restricted shares fully vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. A summary of the changes in the Company’s nonvested restricted shares for 2018 follows: Weighted Average Restricted Grant Date Nonvested Shares Shares Fair Value Nonvested at beginning of period 187,253 $ 14.21 Granted 140,131 16.73 Vested (161,604 ) 13.54 Forfeited (8,164 ) 15.92 Nonvested at end of period 157,616 $ 17.00 As of December 31, 2018, there was $1,814,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $2,804,000, $1,174,000 and $513,000, respectively. Stock Options Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Option awards generally have a three year vesting period and a ten year contractual term. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on calculations performed by management using industry data. At the time of issuance, the Company’s expected dividend yield was 0.00% because the Company had no current plan to pay dividends and historically had not paid dividends. The expected term of options granted was calculated using the “simplified” method for plain vanilla options as permitted under authoritative literature. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted average assumptions as of the grant date. There were no options granted during 2018 or 2017. 2016 Dividend yield — Expected term (in years) 7.48 Expected stock price volatility 17.20 % Risk-free interest rate 1.66 % Pre-vest forfeiture rate 10.25 % 98 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements A summary of the activity in stock options for 2018 follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Exercise Contractual Shares Price Term (years) Outstanding at beginning of period 756,050 $ 10.50 Additions due to acquisition of Athens Bancshares 548,051 $ 5.06 Granted — — Exercised (796,198 ) 8.16 Forfeited or expired — — Outstanding at end of period 507,903 $ 8.66 4.0 Fully vested and expected to vest 506,783 $ 8.66 4.1 Exercisable at end of period 480,403 $ 8.46 4.0 Information related to stock options during 2018, 2017 and 2016 follows: 2018 2017 2016 Intrinsic value of options exercised $ 7,654,738 $ 2,010,536 $ 53,756 Cash received from option exercises 6,897,845 2,013,840 96,306 Tax benefit realized from option exercises 846,725 774,056 20,583 Weighted average fair value of options granted — — 3.16 As of December 31, 2018, there was $32,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.9 years. NOTE 19 – EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain senior executives with various expiration dates. Most of the contracts have an option for annual renewal by mutual agreement. The agreements specify that in certain terminating events the Company will be obligated to provide certain benefits and pay each of the senior executives severance based on their annual salaries. These terminating events include termination of employment without “Cause” (as defined in the agreements) or in certain other circumstances specified in the agreements. NOTE 20 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a Retirement Savings 401(k) Plan in which employees may participate. The Company has elected a safe harbor 401(k) plan and as such is required to make an annual contribution of 3% of the employees’ salaries annually. An employee does not have to contribute to receive the employer contribution. In addition, the Company may make an additional discretionary contribution up to 6% of the employees’ salaries annually. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company contributed $639,000, $550,000 and $536,000, respectively, to the 401(k) Plan. The Company also has a Health Reimbursement Plan in place to offset the cost of healthcare deductibles for employees. At the end of the year, up to one-half of the unused balance in the employee’s account will be available for the following year up to a maximum of the deductible for that employee. NOTE 21 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. The notional amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties. The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate swap agreements. 99 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges Forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $20 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, were designated as cash flow hedges of certain liabilities and were determined to be fully effective during all periods presented. As such, no amount of ineffectiveness has been included in net income. Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swaps is recorded in other assets (liabilities) with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to current earnings should the hedges no longer be considered effective. The Company expects the hedges to remain fully effective during the remaining terms of the swaps. Summary information about the interest-rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Notional amounts $ 20,000 $ 20,000 Weighted average pay rates 3.54 % 3.54 % Weighted average receive rates 3 month LIBOR 3 month LIBOR Weighted average maturity 4.5 years 5.5 years Fair value $ (836 ) $ (1,375 ) Amount of unrealized loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax $ (617 ) $ (849 ) Cash flows began on these forward starting interest rate swaps in 2017. As such, $275,000 and $233,000 of interest expense was recorded on these swap transactions during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Pursuant to its interest rate swap agreements, the Company pledged collateral to the counterparties in the form of investment securities with a carrying value of $2,038,000 at December 31, 2018. There was no collateral posted from the counterparties to the Company as of December 31, 2018. It is possible that the Company may need to post additional collateral in the future or that the counterparties may be required to post collateral to the Company in the future. Other Interest Rate Swaps The Company also enters into swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. Upon entering into these transactions the Company enters into offsetting positions with large U.S. financial institutions in order to minimize risk to the Company. A summary of the Company’s customer related interest rate swaps is as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Notional Estimated Notional Estimated amount fair value amount fair value Interest rate swap agreements: Pay fixed/receive variable swaps $ 29,126 $ 24 $ 41,863 $ 55 Pay variable/receive fixed swaps 29,126 (24 ) 41,863 (55 ) Total $ 58,252 $ — $ 83,726 $ — 100 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 22 – RELATED PARTY The Company may enter into loan transactions with certain directors, executive officers, significant shareholders, and their affiliates. Such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Company, and did not, in the opinion of management, involve more than normal credit risk or present other unfavorable features. None of these loans were impaired at December 31, 2018 or 2017. Activity within these loans during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in thousands): Total commitment Total funded commitment Year ended December 31, 2018 Beginning of period $ 49,409 $ 21,890 New commitments/draw downs 3,631 1,038 Repayments (8,228 ) (7,483 ) End of period $ 44,812 $ 15,445 Year ended December 31, 2017 Beginning of period $ 31,076 $ 20,325 New commitments/draw downs 21,203 4,320 Repayments (2,870 ) (2,755 ) End of period $ 49,409 $ 21,890 Deposits from directors, executive officers, significant shareholders and their affiliates at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $11.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively. NOTE 23 – FAIR VALUE Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2: Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Investment Securities : The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2), using matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded and values debt securities by relying on quoted prices for the specific securities and the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). See below for additional discussion of Level 3 valuation methodologies and significant inputs. The fair values of all securities are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. 101 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Derivatives-Interest Rate Swaps : The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). The Company’s derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair values of all interest rate swaps are determined from third party pricing services without adjustment. Impaired Loans : The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the loan policy. Other Real Estate Owned : Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Appraisals may be adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and/or management’s expertise and knowledge of the collateral. Such adjustments result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. The Company had no other real estate owned carried at fair value at December 31, 2018 or 2017. Loans Held For Sale : Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is evaluated on a pool-level basis. The fair value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other observable market data, such as outstanding commitments from third party investors (Level 2). There were no loans held for sale carried at fair value at December 31, 2018 or 2017. 102 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands): Fair value measurements at December 31, 2018 Quoted prices in active Significant markets for other Significant identical observable unobservable Carrying assets inputs inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Securities available-for-sale: U.S. government-sponsored agencies $ 10,706 $ — $ 10,706 $ — Obligations of states and political subdivisions 61,926 — 61,926 — Mortage-backed securities-residential 144,158 — 144,158 — Asset-backed securities 15,284 — 15,284 — Other debt securities 11,734 — 11,734 — Total securities available-for-sale $ 243,808 $ — $ 243,808 $ — Derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related $ 494 $ — $ 494 $ — Liabilities: Derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related $ (494 ) $ — $ (494 ) $ — Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges (836 ) — (836 ) — Total derivatives $ (1,330 ) $ — $ (1,330 ) $ — Fair value measurements at December 31, 2017 Quoted prices in active Significant markets for other Significant identical observable unobservable Carrying assets inputs inputs Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets: Securities available-for-sale: U.S. government-sponsored agencies $ 11,277 $ — $ 11,277 $ — Obligations of states and political subdivisions 52,998 — 52,998 — Mortage-backed securities-residential 106,562 — 106,562 — Asset-backed securities 16,377 — 16,377 — Other debt securities 5,407 — 5,407 — Total securities available-for-sale $ 192,621 $ — $ 192,621 $ — Derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related $ 184 $ — $ 184 $ — Liabilities: Derivatives: Interest rate swaps - customer related $ (184 ) $ — $ (184 ) $ — Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges (1,375 ) — (1,375 ) — Total derivatives $ (1,559 ) $ — $ (1,559 ) $ — 103 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are summarized below (in thousands).

(b) Federal Funds Sold Federal funds sold clear on a daily basis. For this reason, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. (c) Restricted Equity Securities It is not practical to determine the fair value of restricted securities due to restrictions placed on their transferability. (d) Loans, net During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities.” The amendments included within this standard, which are applied prospectively, require the Company to disclose fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet to measure that fair value using an exit price notion. Prior to adopting the amendments included in the standard, the Company was allowed to measure fair value under an entry price notion. The entry price notion previously applied by the Company used a discounted cash flows technique to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows for a financial instrument. The exit price notion uses the same approach, but also incorporates other factors, such as enhanced credit risk, illiquidity risk and market factors that sometimes exist in exit prices in dislocated markets. As of December 31, 2018, the technique used by the Company to estimate the exit price of the loan portfolio consists of similar procedures to those used as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, but with added emphasis on both illiquidity risk and credit risk not captured by the previously applied entry price notion. The fair value of the Company’s loan portfolio has always included a credit risk assumption in the determination of the fair value of its loans. This credit risk assumption is intended to approximate the fair value that a market participant would realize in a hypothetical orderly transaction. The Company’s loan portfolio is initially fair valued using a segmented approach. The Company divides its loan portfolio into the following categories: variable rate loans, impaired loans and all other loans. The results are then adjusted to account for credit risk as described above. However, under the new guidance, the Company believes a further credit risk discount must be applied through the use of a discounted cash flow model to compensate for illiquidity risk, based on certain assumptions included within the discounted cash flow model, primarily the use of discount rates that better capture inherent credit risk over the lifetime of a loan. This consideration of enhanced credit risk provides an estimated exit price for the Company’s loan portfolio. For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values approximate carrying values. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models or based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the Company’s loan portfolio includes a credit risk assumption in the determination of the fair value of its loans. This credit risk assumption is intended to approximate the fair value that a market participant would realize in a hypothetical orderly transaction. The Company’s loan portfolio is initially fair valued using a segmented approach. The Company divides its loan portfolio into the following categories: variable rate loans, impaired loans and all other loans. The results are then adjusted to account for credit risk. For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values approximate carrying values. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models or based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. For other loans, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The values derived from the discounted cash flow approach for each of the above portfolios are then further discounted to incorporate credit risk. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price as of December 31, 2017. 105 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (e) Accrued interest receivable The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value. (f) Other Assets Included in other assets are bank owned life insurance, certain interest rate swap agreements and the cash flow hedge relationships. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements and the cash flow hedge relationships are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. For bank owned life insurance, the carrying amount is based on the cash surrender value and is a reasonable estimate of fair value. (g) Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated by discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates with similar remaining maturities. (h) Federal Home Loan Bank Advances The fair value of fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank Advances is estimated using discounted cash flow models, using current market interest rates offered on certificates, advances and other borrowings with similar remaining maturities. (i) Other Liabilities Included in other liabilities are accrued interest payable, certain interest rate swap agreements, the cash flow hedge relationships and contingent consideration. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements and the cash flow hedge relationships are based on independent pricing services that utilize pricing models with observable market inputs. The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated by a discounted cash flow model that utilizes various unobservable inputs. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. (j) Off-Balance Sheet Instruments Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material. (k) Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on estimating on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, fixed assets are not considered financial instruments and their value has not been incorporated into the fair value estimates. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates. 106 CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC. & SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 24 – PARENT COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following information presents the condensed balance sheet, statement of income, and cash flows of CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands).

POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2018 include Athens Bancshares Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Athens Federal Community Bank, NA (the “Bank”, together referred to as the “Company”). Significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or in any other period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses (“ALL”), the valuation of our investment portfolio and deferred tax assets. There have been no significant changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2017. Subsequent Events Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 855, Subsequent Events, establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. The Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after September 30, 2018 through the date of the issued financial statements.

The ESOP purchased 222,180 shares with the proceeds of a 15 year loan from the Company which was payable in annual installments and bore interest at 3.25% per annum. ESOP shares are held by the plan trustee in a suspense account until allocated to participant accounts. Shares released from the suspense account are allocated to participants on the basis of their relative compensation in the year of allocation. Participants become vested in the allocated shares upon four years of employment with the Bank. Any forfeited shares are allocated to other participants in the same proportion as contributions. As ESOP shares are allocated to participants, the Bank recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of the earned ESOP shares. As of September 30, 2018 the Bank terminated the ESOP, allocated all unallocated shares to participants and paid of the loan to the Company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Bank recognized $3.6 million in compensation expense related to terminating the ESOP and allocating the remaining shares to participants. NOTE 6 – SUBSEQUENT EVENT On October 1, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 11, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and between CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc., a Tennessee corporation (“CapStar”), and Athens Bancshares Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (“Athens”), Athens was merged with and into CapStar, with CapStar continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Immediately following the Merger, Athens Federal Community Bank, National Association, a wholly owned subsidiary of Athens, merged with and into CapStar Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CapStar (the “Bank Merger”), with CapStar Bank continuing as the surviving entity in the Bank Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Athens (“Athens Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger (other than dissenting shares and shares of Athens common stock owned directly or indirectly by Athens, CapStar and their wholly owned subsidiaries (in each case, other than shares of Athens common stock held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously contracted) was converted into the right to receive 2.864 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of voting common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of CapStar (“CapStar Common Stock”), with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. This resulted in the issuance of 5,181,916 shares of CapStar common stock on October 1, 2018. 118 At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Athens stock option granted under the Athens Bancshares Corporation 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Athens Equity Plan”) that was held by an employee or service provider of Athens who had terminated service prior to the Effective Time was cancelled and converted into the right to receive the cash value of the merger consideration (determined in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement), less the applicable option exercise price and less applicable withholding taxes. Except as described in the prior sentence, each outstanding and unexercised Athens stock option granted under the Athens Equity Plan was converted into an option to purchase shares of CapStar Common Stock, with the number of shares and exercise price adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. The converted options resulted in the right to purchase 548,051 shares of CapStar Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price of $5.06. Total acquisition consideration resulting from the Merger amounted to approximately $92.9 million. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 2.1 to CapStar’s Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 14, 2018 and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. 119 SCHEDULE II—UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF CAPSTAR FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.

Such financial statements do not reflect cost savings or operating synergies expected to result from the mergers, or the costs to achieve these cost savings or operating synergies, or any anticipated disposition of assets that may result from the integration of the operations of the three companies. Certain historical financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The transactions will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). In business combination transactions in which the consideration given is not in the form of cash (that is, in the form of non-cash assets, liabilities incurred, or equity interests issued), measurement of the acquisition consideration is based on the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the asset (or net assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, a more reliable measure. Under ASC 805, all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at their acquisition-date fair value, while transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with the business combination are expensed as incurred. The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill. Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense. Subsequent to the completion of the merger, CapStar and Athens will finalize an integration plan, which may affect how the assets acquired, including intangible assets, will be utilized by the combined company. For those assets in the combined company that will be phased out or will no longer be used, additional amortization, depreciation and possibly impairment charges will be recorded after management completes the integration plan. The unaudited pro forma information is presented solely for informational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations or financial position that might have been achieved for the periods or dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined company. 122 Note 2—Acquisition Consideration Under the terms of the Athens Merger Agreement, Athens shareholders received 2.864 shares of CapStar common stock for each share of Athens common stock. A s of October 1, 2018, the acquisition consideration was as follows. (dollars are in thousands, except per share data) Total number of common shares as provided by Athens management 1,809,358 Total number of Athens common stock to exchange 1,809,358 Per share exchange ratio 2.864 Number of shares of CapStar common stock as exchanged 5,181,916 Multiplied by CapStar common stock price per share on September 30, 2018 $ 16.70 Estimated fair value of CapStar common stock issued (“Stock Consideration”) $ 86,538 Total number of stock options outstanding as provided by Athens management to exchange 548,051 Intrinsic value per stock option outstanding $ 11.64 Estimated fair value of stock options rolled (""Rolled Stock Options Consideration"") $ 6,380 Stock Consideration $ 86,538 Rolled Stock Options Consideration $ 6,380 Total Preliminary Estimated Acquisition Consideration $ 92,918 Note 3—Preliminary Estimated Acquisition Consideration Allocation Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total acquisition consideration is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of Athens based on their estimated fair values as of the closing of the merger. The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill. The allocation of the estimated acquisition consideration with regard to Athens is preliminary because the proposed merger has not yet been completed. The preliminary allocation is based on estimates, assumptions, valuations, and other studies which have not progressed to a stage where there is sufficient information to make a definitive allocation. Accordingly, the acquisition consideration allocation unaudited pro forma adjustments will remain preliminary until CapStar management determines the final acquisition consideration and the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final determination of the acquisition consideration allocation is anticipated to be completed as soon as practicable after the completion of the merger and will be based on the value of the CapStar common stock at the closing of the merger. The final amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial statement. 123 The total preliminary estimated acquisition consideration as shown in the table above is allocated to Athens ’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2018 based on their preliminary estimated fair values as follows. Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,053 Securities available-for-sale 67,426 Loans 344,833 Premises and equipment, net 9,208 Goodwill 31,291 Core deposit intangible 8,980 Other assets 30,510 Deposits (404,520 ) Other liabilities (6,863 ) Total acquisition consideration $ 92,918 Approximately $8,980 has been allocated to amortizable intangible assets acquired. The amortization related to the fair value of net amortizable intangible assets is reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statement. Identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of intangible assets were determined based on the provisions of ASC 805, which defines fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Intangible assets were identified that met either the separability criterion or the contractual-legal criterion described in ASC 805. The allocation to intangible assets is allocated to core deposit intangibles. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the preliminary estimated acquisition consideration over the preliminary fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. Among the factors that contributed to a purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets are the skill sets, operations, customer base and organizational cultures that can be leveraged to enable the combined company to build an enterprise greater than the sum of its parts. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other , goodwill will not be amortized, but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a possible impairment. In the event management determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of the impairment during the period in which the determination is made. Note 4—Preliminary Unaudited Pro Forma and Acquisition Accounting Adjustments The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the financial position actually would have been had the merger been completed at the date indicated. Such information includes adjustments which are preliminary and may be revised. Such revisions may result in material changes. The financial position shown herein is not necessarily indicative of what the past financial position of the combined companies would have been, nor necessarily indicative of the financial position of the post-merger periods. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not give consideration to the impact of possible cost savings, expense efficiencies, synergies, strategy modifications, asset dispositions or other actions that may result from the merger. The following unaudited pro forma adjustments result from accounting for the merger, including the determination of fair value of the assets, liabilities, and commitments which CapStar, as the acquirer, will acquire from Athens. The descriptions related to these preliminary adjustments are as follows. 124 Income Statement – Pro Forma Adjustments Debit Credit a Remove one-time merger related expenses $ 14,535 b Elimination of intercompany income/expense 9 9 c Remove amortization of existing CDI 273 d Amortization of new CDI 1,258 e Deposit premium amortization 178 f Estimate of loan interest accretion 1,012 g Income tax benefit of pro forma adjustments 3,853 a) Remove one-time merger related expenses incurred to date. b) Elimination of intercompany income/expense related to Athens' deposits/loan held at CapStar. c) Remove amortization expense of Athens’ existing core deposit intangible (""CDI"") asset. d) The estimate of CDI related to CapStar's acquisition of Athens is expected to approximate $8,980 and will be amortized over a ten year period on an accelerated basis which is expected to produce approximately $1.7 million of amortization expense during the first twelve months of operations. e) The amortization related to a time deposit premium recorded in connection with estimating the fair value of Athens’ time deposits. f) Represents the estimate of the first twelve months interest income accretion related to the preliminary estimate of the fair value adjustment of the loans acquired pursuant to the merger. The total amount to be accreted in interest income over the estimated lives of the related loans is approximately $4.8 million. g) Adjustment to reflect the income tax provision of the Pro Forma Adjustments using 26.14% as the incremental effective tax rate. Note 5—Earnings per Common Share Unaudited pro forma earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 has been calculated using CapStar’s historic weighted average common shares outstanding plus the common shares assumed to be issued to Athens’ shareholders in the merger. The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted unaudited pro forma earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the table below, amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOU NTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2018, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in 2013. This assessment included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. Based on the assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.
