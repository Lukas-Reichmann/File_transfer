Consolidated Financial Results Revenues for the third quarter totaled $30.4 billion versus $30.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, up 1.0%. This increase primarily reflects higher Mobility, Mexico and Consumer Wireline revenues, partly offset by lower Business Wireline revenues. Revenue increases also reflect favorable impacts of foreign exchange rates in Mexico. * Further clarification and explanation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures” section of the release and at https://investors.att.com. © 2023 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Page 2 Operating expenses were $24.6 billion versus $24.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting higher severance and restructuring charges and continued inflationary cost increases in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by continued transformation efforts. Operating expense increases also reflect increased depreciation expense, higher network costs, unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and increased amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs. These increases were partially offset by lower Mobility equipment and associated selling costs from lower wireless sales volumes, and lower personnel costs. Operating income was $5.8 billion versus $6.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. When adjusting for certain items, adjusted operating income* was $6.5 billion versus $6.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company now expects full-year Adjusted EBITDA* growth of better than 4%, versus prior guidance of 3%+. Equity in net income of affiliates was $0.4 billion, primarily from the DIRECTV investment. With an adjustment for our proportionate share of intangible amortization, adjusted equity in net income from the DIRECTV investment * was $0.7 billion. Income from continuing operations was $3.8 billion, versus $6.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations 2 was $0.48 versus $0.79 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for $0.16, which includes severance and restructuring charges, an impairment of an equity investment in a Latin America satellite business, our proportionate share of intangible amortization from the DIRECTV equity method investment and an actuarial gain on benefit plans and other items, earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations * was $0.64 compared to $0.68 in the year-ago quarter. Cash from operating activities from continuing operations was $10.3 billion, up $0.2 billion year over year, reflecting operational growth and timing of working capital, including lower device payments partially offset by a lower net impact from receivable sales. Capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the quarter versus $5.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Capital investment * , which includes $1.0 billion of cash payments for vendor financing, totaled $5.6 billion. Free cash flow * was $5.2 billion for the quarter. Total debt was $138.0 billion at the end of the quarter, and net debt * was $128.7 billion. The company expects to achieve net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA * in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025. * Further clarification and explanation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures” section of the release and at https://investors.att.com. © 2023 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Page 3 Communications Operational Highlights Third-quarter revenues were $29.2 billion, up 0.4% year over year due to increases in Mobility and Consumer Wireline, which more than offset a decline in Business Wireline. Operating income was $7.3 billion, up 4.1% year over year, with operating income margin of 24.9%, compared to 24.0% in the year-ago quarter. Mobility • Revenues were up 2.0% year over year to $20.7 billion due to higher service revenues. Service revenues were $15.9 billion, up 3.7% year over year, primarily driven by subscriber and postpaid phone ARPU growth. Equipment revenues were $4.8 billion, down 3.2% year over year due to lower device volumes. • Operating expenses were $13.9 billion, down 0.9% year over year, primarily due to lower equipment costs and associated selling expenses driven by lower device sales, partly offset by higher network and customer support costs, increased amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs and higher depreciation expense. • Operating income was $6.8 billion, up 8.6% year over year. Operating income margin was 32.7%, compared to 30.7% in the year-ago quarter. • EBITDA * was $8.9 billion, up 7.6% year over year with EBITDA margin * of 43.0%, up from 40.8% in the year-ago quarter. This was the company’s best-ever quarterly Mobility EBITDA*. EBITDA service margin * was 55.9%, up from 53.9% in the year-ago quarter. • Total wireless net adds were 6.6 million, including: o 550,000 postpaid net adds with: o 468,000 postpaid phone net adds o (48,000) postpaid tablet and other branded computing device net losses o 130,000 other net adds o 26,000 prepaid phone net adds • Postpaid churn improved to 0.95% versus 1.01% in the year-ago quarter. • Postpaid phone churn improved to 0.79% versus 0.84% in the year-ago quarter . • Prepaid churn was 2.78%, with Cricket substantially lower, versus 2.83% in the year-ago quarter. • Postpaid phone ARPU was $55.99, up 0.6% versus the year-ago quarter, due to pricing actions, higher international roaming and a mix shift to higher-priced unlimited plans. • FirstNet connections reached about 5.3 million across nearly 27,000 agencies.

The AT&T and FirstNet networks cover more than 99% of the U.S. population, and FirstNet covers more first responders than any other network in America. * Further clarification and explanation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures” section of the release and at https://investors.att.com. © 2023 AT&T Intellectual Property. All rights reserved. AT&T and the Globe logo are registered trademarks of AT&T Intellectual Property. Page 4 Business Wireline • Revenues were $5.2 billion, down 7.9% year over year due to lower demand for legacy voice and data services and product simplification, partly offset by growth in connectivity services. This quarter also included approximately $100 million in revenues from intellectual property sales, which were relatively consistent with the prior year. • Operating expenses were $4.9 billion, down 3.5% year over year due to lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, and lower wholesale network access, customer support and marketing expenses. • Operating income was $350 million, down 43.6%, with operating income margin of 6.7% compared to 11.0% in the year-ago quarter. • EBITDA * was $1.7 billion, down 13.7% year over year with EBITDA margin * of 32.5%, compared to 34.6% in the year-ago quarter.

Nationwide, more than 10 million business customer locations are on or within 1,000 feet of our fiber. 3 Consumer Wireline • Revenues were $3.3 billion, up 4.6% year over year due to gains in broadband more than offsetting declines in legacy voice and data and other services. Broadband revenues increased 9.8% due to fiber growth of 26.9%, partly offset by a 9.0% decline in non-fiber revenues. The company now expects full-year broadband revenue growth of 7%+, versus prior guidance of 5%+. • Operating expenses were $3.2 billion, up 4.2% year over year due to higher depreciation expense and higher network-related costs, partly offset by lower customer support costs. • Operating income was $160 million, up 12.7% year over year with operating income margin of 4.8%, compared to 4.5% in the year-ago quarter. • EBITDA * was $1.0 billion, up 9.4% year over year with EBITDA margin * of 31.0%, up from 29.6% in the year-ago quarter. • Total broadband net gains , excluding DSL and including AT&T Internet Air, were 15,000, reflecting AT&T Fiber net adds of 296,000, more than offsetting losses in non-fiber services. AT&T Fiber is now capable of serving 20.7 million customer locations and offers symmetrical, multi-gig speeds across parts of its entire footprint of more than 100 metro areas. * Further clarification and explanation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures” section of the release and at https://investors.att.com. © 2023 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Page 6 Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures Schedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at https://investors.att.com and in our Form 8-K dated October 19, 2023. Free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted diluted EPS, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. Free cash flow for 3Q23 of $5.2 billion is cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $10.3 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.5 billion, minus capital expenditures of $4.6 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.0 billion. For 3Q23 year-to-date, free cash flow of $10.4 billion is cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $1.4 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.3 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $4.7 billion. For 3Q22 year-to-date, free cash flow of $8.0 billion is cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $25.5 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $2.2 billion, minus capital expenditures of $15.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $4.2 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, cash distributions from DIRECTV, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected free cash flow and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Operating Income is operating income adjusted for revenues and costs we consider non-operational in nature, including items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions. For 3Q23 , adjusted operating income of $6.5 billion is calculated as operating income of $5.8 billion plus $737 million of adjustments. For 3Q22 , adjusted operating income of $6.2 billion is calculated as operating income of $6.0 billion plus $204 million of adjustments. Adjustments for all periods are detailed in the Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures included in our Form 8-K dated October 19, 2023. EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by total revenues. EBITDA service margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by total service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairment, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and Business Wireline EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues and expenses which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Business Wireline EBITDA or projected adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Equity in Net Income from DIRECTV investment of $0.7 billion for 3Q23 is calculated as equity income from DIRECTV of $0.4 billion reported in Equity in Net Income of Affiliates and excludes $0.3 billion of AT&T’s proportionate share of the non-cash depreciation and amortization of fair value accretion from DIRECTV’s revaluation of assets and purchase price allocation, which we consider to be non-operational in nature. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations includes adjusting items to revenues and costs that we consider non-operational in nature, including items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions, including the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. * Further clarification and explanation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures” section of the release and at https://investors.att.com. © 2023 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Page 7 We adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. For 3Q23 , Adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.64 is Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.48 adjusted for $0.11 restructuring and impairments, $0.03 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, and $0.03 benefit-related, transaction and other costs, minus $0.01 actuarial gain on benefit plans. For 3Q22 , Adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.68 is Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.79 adjusted for $0.04 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, $0.06 benefit-related, transaction and other costs, $0.02 dilutive impact of Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, and $0.01 restructuring and impairments, minus $0.14 actuarial gain on benefit plans and $0.10 tax-related items. Capital investment is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides an additional view of cash paid for capital investment to provide a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we negotiate with some of our vendors to obtain favorable payment terms of 120 days or more, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported in accordance with GAAP as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing ($1.0 billion in 3Q23). Net Debt of $128.7 billion at September 30, 2023, is calculated as Total Debt of $138.0 billion less Cash and Cash Equivalents of $7.5 billion and Time Deposits (i.e. deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days) of $1.8 billion. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA. Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days (e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits), from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as defined above. Net debt and adjusted EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort.

Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing performance with that of many of our competitors. These measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Free cash flow after dividends is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities, minus capital expenditures, cash paid for vendor financing and dividends on common and preferred shares. Free cash flow dividend payout ratio is defined as the percentage of dividends paid on common and preferred shares to free cash flow. We believe these metrics provide useful information to our investors because management views free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated by routine business operations, including capital expenditures and vendor financing, and from our continued economic interest in the U.S. video operations as part of our DIRECTV equity method investment, and makes decisions based on it. Management also views free cash flow as a measure of cash available to pay debt and return cash to shareowners.

Cash Paid for Capital Investment In connection with capital improvements, we negotiate with some of our vendors to obtain favorable payment terms of 120 days or more, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported in accordance with GAAP as financing activities. We present an additional view of cash paid for capital investment to provide investors with a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. Cash Paid for Capital Investment Dollars in millions Third Quarter Nine-Month Period 2023 2022 2023 2022 Capital Expenditures $ (4,647) $ (5,921) $ (13,252) $ (15,397) Cash paid for vendor financing (980) (900) (4,736) (4,237) Cash paid for Capital Investment $ (5,627) $ (6,821) $ (17,988) $ (19,634) EBITDA Our calculation of EBITDA, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For AT&T, EBITDA excludes other income (expense) – net, and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates, as these do not reflect the operating results of our subscriber base or operations that are not under our control. Equity in net income (loss) of affiliates represents the proportionate share of the net income (loss) of affiliates in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control. Because we do not control these entities, management excludes these results when evaluating the performance of our primary operations. EBITDA also excludes interest expense and the provision for income taxes. Excluding these items eliminates the expenses associated with our capital and tax structures. Finally, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments. EBITDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA is not presented as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA service margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by service revenues. These measures are used by management as a gauge of our success in acquiring, retaining and servicing subscribers because we believe these measures reflect AT&T's ability to generate and grow subscriber revenues while providing a high level of customer service in a cost-effective manner. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing cash generation potential with that of many of its competitors. The financial and operating metrics which affect EBITDA include the key revenue and expense drivers for which management is responsible and upon which we evaluate performance. We believe EBITDA Service Margin (EBITDA as a percentage of service revenues) to be a more relevant measure than EBITDA Margin (EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue) for our Mobility business unit operating margin. We also use wireless service revenues to calculate margin to facilitate comparison, both internally and externally with our wireless competitors, as they calculate their margins using wireless service revenues as well. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA service margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, these performance measures do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, tax expense and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates. For market comparability, management analyzes performance measures that are similar in nature to EBITDA as we present it, and considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with its analysis of net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA service margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.

While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and that those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%.

We recorded total net actuarial gains of $0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023. As a result, adjusted EPS reflects an expected return on plan assets of $0.6 billion (based on an average annual expected return on plan assets of 7.5% for our pension trust), rather than the actual return on plan assets of $(1.5) billion (actual pension return of (5.0)%), included in the GAAP measure of income. 2 As of January 1, 2022, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, which requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock to be presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted EPS. While our intent was to settle the Mobility II preferred interests in cash, the ability to settle this instrument in AT&T shares resulted in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which was influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. For these reasons, we excluded the impact of ASU 2020-06 from our adjusted EPS calculation. The per share impact of ASU 2020-06 was to decrease reported diluted EPS $0.00 and $0.02 for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and $0.01 and $0.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Mobility II preferred interests were repurchased on April 5, 2023. 5 Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Net Debt to EBITDA ratios are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies and management believes these measures provide relevant and useful information to investors and other users of our financial data. Our Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated by dividing the Net Debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters Adjusted EBITDA. Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days (e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits), from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt.

Consolidated Financial Results Revenues for the third quarter totaled $30.4 billion versus $30.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, up 1.0%. This increase primarily reflects higher Mobility, Mexico and Consumer Wireline revenues, partly offset by lower Business Wireline revenues. Revenue increases also reflect favorable impacts of foreign exchange rates in Mexico. * Further clarification and explanation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures” section of the release and at https://investors.att.com. © 2023 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Page 2 Operating expenses were $24.6 billion versus $24.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting higher severance and restructuring charges and continued inflationary cost increases in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by continued transformation efforts. Operating expense increases also reflect increased depreciation expense, higher network costs, unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and increased amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs. These increases were partially offset by lower Mobility equipment and associated selling costs from lower wireless sales volumes, and lower personnel costs. Operating income was $5.8 billion versus $6.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. When adjusting for certain items, adjusted operating income* was $6.5 billion versus $6.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company now expects full-year Adjusted EBITDA* growth of better than 4%, versus prior guidance of 3%+. Equity in net income of affiliates was $0.4 billion, primarily from the DIRECTV investment. With an adjustment for our proportionate share of intangible amortization, adjusted equity in net income from the DIRECTV investment * was $0.7 billion. Income from continuing operations was $3.8 billion, versus $6.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations 2 was $0.48 versus $0.79 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for $0.16, which includes severance and restructuring charges, an impairment of an equity investment in a Latin America satellite business, our proportionate share of intangible amortization from the DIRECTV equity method investment and an actuarial gain on benefit plans and other items, earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations * was $0.64 compared to $0.68 in the year-ago quarter. Cash from operating activities from continuing operations was $10.3 billion, up $0.2 billion year over year, reflecting operational growth and timing of working capital, including lower device payments partially offset by a lower net impact from receivable sales. Capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the quarter versus $5.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Capital investment * , which includes $1.0 billion of cash payments for vendor financing, totaled $5.6 billion. Free cash flow * was $5.2 billion for the quarter. Total debt was $138.0 billion at the end of the quarter, and net debt * was $128.7 billion. The company expects to achieve net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA * in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025. * Further clarification and explanation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures” section of the release and at https://investors.att.com. © 2023 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Page 3 Communications Operational Highlights Third-quarter revenues were $29.2 billion, up 0.4% year over year due to increases in Mobility and Consumer Wireline, which more than offset a decline in Business Wireline. Operating income was $7.3 billion, up 4.1% year over year, with operating income margin of 24.9%, compared to 24.0% in the year-ago quarter. Mobility • Revenues were up 2.0% year over year to $20.7 billion due to higher service revenues. Service revenues were $15.9 billion, up 3.7% year over year, primarily driven by subscriber and postpaid phone ARPU growth. Equipment revenues were $4.8 billion, down 3.2% year over year due to lower device volumes. • Operating expenses were $13.9 billion, down 0.9% year over year, primarily due to lower equipment costs and associated selling expenses driven by lower device sales, partly offset by higher network and customer support costs, increased amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs and higher depreciation expense. • Operating income was $6.8 billion, up 8.6% year over year. Operating income margin was 32.7%, compared to 30.7% in the year-ago quarter. • EBITDA * was $8.9 billion, up 7.6% year over year with EBITDA margin * of 43.0%, up from 40.8% in the year-ago quarter. This was the company’s best-ever quarterly Mobility EBITDA*. EBITDA service margin * was 55.9%, up from 53.9% in the year-ago quarter. • Total wireless net adds were 6.6 million, including: o 550,000 postpaid net adds with: o 468,000 postpaid phone net adds o (48,000) postpaid tablet and other branded computing device net losses o 130,000 other net adds o 26,000 prepaid phone net adds • Postpaid churn improved to 0.95% versus 1.01% in the year-ago quarter. • Postpaid phone churn improved to 0.79% versus 0.84% in the year-ago quarter . • Prepaid churn was 2.78%, with Cricket substantially lower, versus 2.83% in the year-ago quarter. • Postpaid phone ARPU was $55.99, up 0.6% versus the year-ago quarter, due to pricing actions, higher international roaming and a mix shift to higher-priced unlimited plans. • FirstNet connections reached about 5.3 million across nearly 27,000 agencies.

Page 4 Business Wireline • Revenues were $5.2 billion, down 7.9% year over year due to lower demand for legacy voice and data services and product simplification, partly offset by growth in connectivity services. This quarter also included approximately $100 million in revenues from intellectual property sales, which were relatively consistent with the prior year. • Operating expenses were $4.9 billion, down 3.5% year over year due to lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, and lower wholesale network access, customer support and marketing expenses. • Operating income was $350 million, down 43.6%, with operating income margin of 6.7% compared to 11.0% in the year-ago quarter. • EBITDA * was $1.7 billion, down 13.7% year over year with EBITDA margin * of 32.5%, compared to 34.6% in the year-ago quarter. The company now expects full-year Business Wireline EBITDA* declines in the low-double digits, versus prior guidance of high-single digit declines. • AT&T Business serves the largest global companies, government agencies and small businesses.

Nationwide, more than 10 million business customer locations are on or within 1,000 feet of our fiber. 3 Consumer Wireline • Revenues were $3.3 billion, up 4.6% year over year due to gains in broadband more than offsetting declines in legacy voice and data and other services. Broadband revenues increased 9.8% due to fiber growth of 26.9%, partly offset by a 9.0% decline in non-fiber revenues. The company now expects full-year broadband revenue growth of 7%+, versus prior guidance of 5%+. • Operating expenses were $3.2 billion, up 4.2% year over year due to higher depreciation expense and higher network-related costs, partly offset by lower customer support costs. • Operating income was $160 million, up 12.7% year over year with operating income margin of 4.8%, compared to 4.5% in the year-ago quarter. • EBITDA * was $1.0 billion, up 9.4% year over year with EBITDA margin * of 31.0%, up from 29.6% in the year-ago quarter. • Total broadband net gains , excluding DSL and including AT&T Internet Air, were 15,000, reflecting AT&T Fiber net adds of 296,000, more than offsetting losses in non-fiber services.

Page 6 Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures Schedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at https://investors.att.com and in our Form 8-K dated October 19, 2023. Free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted diluted EPS, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. Free cash flow for 3Q23 of $5.2 billion is cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $10.3 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.5 billion, minus capital expenditures of $4.6 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.0 billion. For 3Q23 year-to-date, free cash flow of $10.4 billion is cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $1.4 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.3 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $4.7 billion. For 3Q22 year-to-date, free cash flow of $8.0 billion is cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $25.5 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $2.2 billion, minus capital expenditures of $15.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $4.2 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, cash distributions from DIRECTV, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected free cash flow and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Operating Income is operating income adjusted for revenues and costs we consider non-operational in nature, including items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions. For 3Q23 , adjusted operating income of $6.5 billion is calculated as operating income of $5.8 billion plus $737 million of adjustments. For 3Q22 , adjusted operating income of $6.2 billion is calculated as operating income of $6.0 billion plus $204 million of adjustments. Adjustments for all periods are detailed in the Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures included in our Form 8-K dated October 19, 2023. EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by total revenues. EBITDA service margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by total service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairment, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and Business Wireline EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues and expenses which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Business Wireline EBITDA or projected adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Equity in Net Income from DIRECTV investment of $0.7 billion for 3Q23 is calculated as equity income from DIRECTV of $0.4 billion reported in Equity in Net Income of Affiliates and excludes $0.3 billion of AT&T’s proportionate share of the non-cash depreciation and amortization of fair value accretion from DIRECTV’s revaluation of assets and purchase price allocation, which we consider to be non-operational in nature. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations includes adjusting items to revenues and costs that we consider non-operational in nature, including items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions, including the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. * Further clarification and explanation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP Measures” section of the release and at https://investors.att.com. © 2023 AT&T Intellectual Property. All rights reserved. AT&T and the Globe logo are registered trademarks of AT&T Intellectual Property. Page 7 We adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. For 3Q23 , Adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.64 is Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.48 adjusted for $0.11 restructuring and impairments, $0.03 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, and $0.03 benefit-related, transaction and other costs, minus $0.01 actuarial gain on benefit plans. For 3Q22 , Adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.68 is Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.79 adjusted for $0.04 proportionate share of intangible amortization at the DIRECTV equity method investment, $0.06 benefit-related, transaction and other costs, $0.02 dilutive impact of Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, and $0.01 restructuring and impairments, minus $0.14 actuarial gain on benefit plans and $0.10 tax-related items. Capital investment is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides an additional view of cash paid for capital investment to provide a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we negotiate with some of our vendors to obtain favorable payment terms of 120 days or more, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported in accordance with GAAP as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing ($1.0 billion in 3Q23). Net Debt of $128.7 billion at September 30, 2023, is calculated as Total Debt of $138.0 billion less Cash and Cash Equivalents of $7.5 billion and Time Deposits (i.e. deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days) of $1.8 billion. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA. Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days (e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits), from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as defined above. Net debt and adjusted EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort.

Third-quarter 2023 income per diluted share included amounts totaling to $1.5 billion (pre-tax), or $(0.16) per share, resulting from the following significant items: $(0.11) per share from restructuring and impairment charges, $(0.03) per share from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and $(0.03) per share of other benefit related market-driven adjustments and other items, partially offset by $0.01 per share from a gain on actuarial remeasurement of the pension benefit plan assets and obligations. Th ese results com pare with a reported net income from continuing operations of $6.3 billion, or $0.79 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2022, which included actuarial gains on remeasurement of our pension benefit plan assets and obligations of $0.14 per share and benefits from tax items of $0.10 per share, partially offset by $(0.04) per share from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, $(0.04) per share of other benefit related market-driven adjustments and $(0.05) per share of other charges, including $(0.02) for the impact from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06. Operating revenues in the third quarter of 2023 were $30.4 billion, up 1.0 percent from the third quarter of 2022, reflecting higher Mobility and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by continued declines in Business Wireline. Revenue increases also reflect f avorable impacts of foreign exchange rates in Mexico. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were $24.6 billion, up 2.2 percent, reflecting higher severance and restructuring charges and continued inflationary cost increases, partially offset by our continued transformation efforts. Operating expense increases also include higher network costs, unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, higher amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs and increased depreciation expense. Expense increases were partially offset by lower Mobility equipment and associated selling costs from lower wireless sales volumes and lower personnel costs. Operating income in the third quarter was $5.8 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the comparable 2022 period, and AT&T’s third-quarter operating income margin was 19.1 percent, compared to 20.0 percent in the comparable 2022 period. Other income (expense) - net in the third quarter was $0.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion in the comparable 2022 period. The decrease reflects the recognition of $0.1 billion actuarial gain in the third quarter of 2023, compared to $1.4 billion of actuarial gain in 2022. Also contributing to the decrease was a $0.5 billion impairment of an equity investment in a Latin America satellite business in the third quarter of 2023, and lower pension and postretirement benefit credits in 2023, primarily driven by higher interest costs from discount rate increases. Cash from operating activities from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2023 was $10.3 billion, up $0.2 billion when compared to 2022, reflecting operational growth and timing of working capital, including lower device payments partially offset by lower receivable sales. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2023 were $4.6 billion, and when including $1.0 billion cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $5.6 billion, compared to prior-year third quarter capital investment of $6.8 billion (capital expenditures of $5.9 billion and vendor financing of $0.9 billion). Segment Summary We analyze our segments based on segment operating income, which excludes acquisition-related costs and other significant items. Our reportable segments are: Communications and Latin America. Effective for the first quarter of 2023, we no longer record prior service credits to our individual business units or the corresponding charge to Corporate and Other, and segment operating expenses were recast to remove prior service credits from our historical reporting. Prior service credits are, and will continue to be, recorded as other income in our consolidated income statement in accordance with GAAP. This recast increased Communications segment operations and support expenses by approximately $2.4 billion for full-year 2022. Correspondingly, this recast lowered administrative expenses within Corporate and Other, with no change on a consolidated basis. Communications Our Communications segment consists of our Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. Third-quarter 2023 operating revenues were $29.2 billion, up 0.4 percent versus third-quarter 2022, with segment operating income of $7.3 billion, up 4.1 percent versus the year-ago quarter. T he Communications segment operating income margin was 24.9 percent, compared to 24.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter. 1 Mobility Mobility revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $20.7 billion, up 2.0 percent versus the third quarter of 2022, driven by service revenue growth of 3.7% from subscriber and postpaid phone ARPU growth, partially offset by lower equipment revenues due to lower sales volumes. Mobility operating expenses totaled $13.9 billion, down 0.9 percent versus the third quarter of 2022 due to lower equipment and associated selling expenses driven by lower device sales. These decreases were partially offset by increased network and customer support costs, higher amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs and higher depreciation expense. Mobility’s operating income margin was 32.7 percent compared to 30.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. In our Mobility business unit, during the third quarter of 2023, we reported a net gain of 6.6 million wireless subscribers. At September 30, 2023, wireless subscribers totaled 235.6 million (including approximately 5.3 mil lion FirstNet connections) compared to 210.7 million at September 30, 2022. During the third quarter, total phone net adds (postpaid and prepaid) were 494,000 with total net adds by subscriber category as follows: • Postpaid subscriber net adds were 550,000, with phone net adds of 468,000. • Prepaid subscriber net adds were 56,000, with phone net adds of 26,000. • Reseller net adds were 401,000. • Connected device net adds were 5.5 million, 2.8 million of which were wholesale connected cars. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, postpaid phone-only ARPU increased 0.6 percent versus the year-earlier quarter. Postpaid phone-only churn was 0.79 percent compared to 0.84 percent in the third quarter of 2022. Total postpaid churn was 0.95 percent compared to 1.01 percent in the year-ago quarter. Business Wireline Business Wireline revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $5.2 billion, down 7.9 percent versus the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower demand for legacy voice and data services as well as product simplification, partially offset by growth in connectivity services. Business Wireline operating expenses totaled $4.9 billion, down 3.5 percent when compared to the third quarter of 2022, due to lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, and lower network access, customer support and marketing expenses. Business Wireline operating income margin was 6.7 percent compared to 11.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Consumer Wireline Consumer Wireline revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $3.3 billion, up 4.6 percent versus the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in broadband revenues attributable to fiber, partially offset by declines in legacy voice and data services and other services. Consumer Wireline operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion, up 4.2 percent versus the third quarter of 2022, largely driven by increased depreciation expense and higher network-related costs. Expense increases were offset by lower customer support costs. Consumer Wireline operating income margin was 4.8 percent compared to 4.5 percent in the year-earlier quarter. At September 30, 2023, Consumer Wireline had approximately 13.7 million broadband connections compared to 13.8 million at September 30, 2022. During the third quarter, broadband subscriber net adds were 15,000, with fiber broadband net adds of 296,000. Total broadband and DSL connections were 13.9 million at September 30, 2023, compared to 14.1 million at September 30, 2022. Latin America Our Latin America segment consists of our Mexico business unit and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Revenues were $1.0 billion, up 26.4 percent when compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to favorable impacts of foreign exchange rates and subscriber growth, which contributed to higher equipment and, to a lesser extent, service revenues. Operating expenses were $1.0 billion, up 20.4 percent, driven by unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher equipment sales attributable to subscriber growth. Mexico’s operating income margin was (2.9) percent, compared to (8.0) percent in the year-earlier quarter. We had approximately 21.8 million Mexico wireless subscribers at September 30, 2023 compared to 21.0 million at September 30, 2022. During the third quarter of 2023, we had postpaid net adds of 55,000 and prepaid net adds of 17,000. 2 CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Information set forth in this filing contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as “we” or “AT&T.” AT&T is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries. Overview We announced on October 19, 2023 that third-quarter 2023 income from continuing operations totaled $3.8 billion, or $0.48 per diluted share. Third-quarter 2023 income per diluted share included amounts totaling to $1.5 billion (pre-tax), or $(0.16) per share, resulting from the following significant items: $(0.11) per share from restructuring and impairment charges, $(0.03) per share from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and $(0.03) per share of other benefit related market-driven adjustments and other items, partially offset by $0.01 per share from a gain on actuarial remeasurement of the pension benefit plan assets and obligations. Th ese results com pare with a reported net income from continuing operations of $6.3 billion, or $0.79 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2022, which included actuarial gains on remeasurement of our pension benefit plan assets and obligations of $0.14 per share and benefits from tax items of $0.10 per share, partially offset by $(0.04) per share from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, $(0.04) per share of other benefit related market-driven adjustments and $(0.05) per share of other charges, including $(0.02) for the impact from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06. Operating revenues in the third quarter of 2023 were $30.4 billion, up 1.0 percent from the third quarter of 2022, reflecting higher Mobility and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by continued declines in Business Wireline. Revenue increases also reflect f avorable impacts of foreign exchange rates in Mexico. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were $24.6 billion, up 2.2 percent, reflecting higher severance and restructuring charges and continued inflationary cost increases, partially offset by our continued transformation efforts. Operating expense increases also include higher network costs, unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, higher amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs and increased depreciation expense. Expense increases were partially offset by lower Mobility equipment and associated selling costs from lower wireless sales volumes and lower personnel costs. Operating income in the third quarter was $5.8 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the comparable 2022 period, and AT&T’s third-quarter operating income margin was 19.1 percent, compared to 20.0 percent in the comparable 2022 period. Other income (expense) - net in the third quarter was $0.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion in the comparable 2022 period. The decrease reflects the recognition of $0.1 billion actuarial gain in the third quarter of 2023, compared to $1.4 billion of actuarial gain in 2022. Also contributing to the decrease was a $0.5 billion impairment of an equity investment in a Latin America satellite business in the third quarter of 2023, and lower pension and postretirement benefit credits in 2023, primarily driven by higher interest costs from discount rate increases. Cash from operating activities from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2023 was $10.3 billion, up $0.2 billion when compared to 2022, reflecting operational growth and timing of working capital, including lower device payments partially offset by lower receivable sales. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2023 were $4.6 billion, and when including $1.0 billion cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $5.6 billion, compared to prior-year third quarter capital investment of $6.8 billion (capital expenditures of $5.9 billion and vendor financing of $0.9 billion). Segment Summary We analyze our segments based on segment operating income, which excludes acquisition-related costs and other significant items. Our reportable segments are: Communications and Latin America. Effective for the first quarter of 2023, we no longer record prior service credits to our individual business units or the corresponding charge to Corporate and Other, and segment operating expenses were recast to remove prior service credits from our historical reporting. Prior service credits are, and will continue to be, recorded as other income in our consolidated income statement in accordance with GAAP. This recast increased Communications segment operations and support expenses by approximately $2.4 billion for full-year 2022. Correspondingly, this recast lowered administrative expenses within Corporate and Other, with no change on a consolidated basis. Communications Our Communications segment consists of our Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. Third-quarter 2023 operating revenues were $29.2 billion, up 0.4 percent versus third-quarter 2022, with segment operating income of $7.3 billion, up 4.1 percent versus the year-ago quarter. T he Communications segment operating income margin was 24.9 percent, compared to 24.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter. 1 Mobility Mobility revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $20.7 billion, up 2.0 percent versus the third quarter of 2022, driven by service revenue growth of 3.7% from subscriber and postpaid phone ARPU growth, partially offset by lower equipment revenues due to lower sales volumes. Mobility operating expenses totaled $13.9 billion, down 0.9 percent versus the third quarter of 2022 due to lower equipment and associated selling expenses driven by lower device sales. These decreases were partially offset by increased network and customer support costs, higher amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs and higher depreciation expense. Mobility’s operating income margin was 32.7 percent compared to 30.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. In our Mobility business unit, during the third quarter of 2023, we reported a net gain of 6.6 million wireless subscribers. At September 30, 2023, wireless subscribers totaled 235.6 million (including approximately 5.3 mil lion FirstNet connections) compared to 210.7 million at September 30, 2022. During the third quarter, total phone net adds (postpaid and prepaid) were 494,000 with total net adds by subscriber category as follows: • Postpaid subscriber net adds were 550,000, with phone net adds of 468,000. • Prepaid subscriber net adds were 56,000, with phone net adds of 26,000. • Reseller net adds were 401,000. • Connected device net adds were 5.5 million, 2.8 million of which were wholesale connected cars. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, postpaid phone-only ARPU increased 0.6 percent versus the year-earlier quarter. Postpaid phone-only churn was 0.79 percent compared to 0.84 percent in the third quarter of 2022. Total postpaid churn was 0.95 percent compared to 1.01 percent in the year-ago quarter. Business Wireline Business Wireline revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $5.2 billion, down 7.9 percent versus the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower demand for legacy voice and data services as well as product simplification, partially offset by growth in connectivity services. Business Wireline operating expenses totaled $4.9 billion, down 3.5 percent when compared to the third quarter of 2022, due to lower personnel costs associated with ongoing transformation initiatives, and lower network access, customer support and marketing expenses. Business Wireline operating income margin was 6.7 percent compared to 11.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Consumer Wireline Consumer Wireline revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $3.3 billion, up 4.6 percent versus the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in broadband revenues attributable to fiber, partially offset by declines in legacy voice and data services and other services. Consumer Wireline operating expenses totaled $3.2 billion, up 4.2 percent versus the third quarter of 2022, largely driven by increased depreciation expense and higher network-related costs. Expense increases were offset by lower customer support costs. Consumer Wireline operating income margin was 4.8 percent compared to 4.5 percent in the year-earlier quarter. At September 30, 2023, Consumer Wireline had approximately 13.7 million broadband connections compared to 13.8 million at September 30, 2022. During the third quarter, broadband subscriber net adds were 15,000, with fiber broadband net adds of 296,000. Total broadband and DSL connections were 13.9 million at September 30, 2023, compared to 14.1 million at September 30, 2022. Latin America Our Latin America segment consists of our Mexico business unit and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Revenues were $1.0 billion, up 26.4 percent when compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to favorable impacts of foreign exchange rates and subscriber growth, which contributed to higher equipment and, to a lesser extent, service revenues. Operating expenses were $1.0 billion, up 20.4 percent, driven by unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher equipment sales attributable to subscriber growth. Mexico’s operating income margin was (2.9) percent, compared to (8.0) percent in the year-earlier quarter. We had approximately 21.8 million Mexico wireless subscribers at September 30, 2023 compared to 21.0 million at September 30, 2022. During the third quarter of 2023, we had postpaid net adds of 55,000 and prepaid net adds of 17,000. 2 CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Information set forth in this filing contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

As set forth more fully in the Settlement, the Settlement provides the following benefits to - 2 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 Wells Fargo. First , Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo have agreed and acknowledged that facts and allegations in this Action were significant factors taken into account in conducting the investigation respecting Improper Sales Practices and in recommending or taking actions concerning the forfeitures of approximately $60 million in equity awards from the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, John G. Stumpf, and former Senior Executive Vice President and head of Community Banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. Second , Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo have agreed and acknowledged that facts alleged in this Action and proposals made by Plaintiffs in connection with the prosecution and proposed resolution of this Action were significant and contributing factors taken into account by Wells Fargo in implementing a series of corporate governance reforms intended to address and prevent a future occurrence of the unlawful conduct alleged in the Action. As detailed in the Settlement, these reforms include, among other things, (i) the separation of the roles of Board Chair and CEO; (ii) the addition of several new directors to the Board; (iii) the appointment of new directors to serve on (and new leaders to chair) the Board’s key committees, including the Risk Committee, Human Resources Committee (""HRC""), and the Governance and Nominating Committee; (iv) changes to the Risk Committee’s makeup and oversight responsibilities (with a new subcommittee formed for oversight of compliance); and (v) the implementation of new compensation and performance management programs in the Community Bank focused on the customer experience. Third , this Settlement was resolved as part of an effort to resolve all derivative actions brought in both state and federal court asserting derivative claims regarding both Improper Sales Practices and claims regarding the placement of automobile collateral protection insurance coverage. In addition to the corporate governance reforms discussed above, the separately negotiated settlement of the federal Improper Sales Practices derivative claims calls for a $240 million payment and other benefits to Wells Fargo, which the Company will receive upon resolution of all the derivative actions. Please read this entire Notice and the Settlement for a full description of the benefits to Wells Fargo from the settlement. What Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, and Reimbursement Awards are requested? As part of the Settlement Hearing, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel intend - 3 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 to apply to the Court for an award of fees, expenses, and Reimbursement Awards (as defined in the Stipulation) in connection with the Action which shall not exceed the amounts negotiated with Wells Fargo. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Wells Fargo have agreed that Wells Fargo shall pay $7,750,000 as an appropriate amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses to Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel for their work in connection with bringing this Action and the relief obtained, subject to Court approval. Wells Fargo also has agreed to pay $420,000 as an appropriate amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses to compensate Herron’s Counsel for its work in the action and its contributions to the Settlement, subject to Court approval. Wells Fargo also has agreed to Reimbursement Awards (defined below), not to exceed $10,000 each, to be paid to Plaintiffs and Herron, with any such award to be paid out of any attorneys’ fees awarded by the Court. Please read this entire Notice and the Settlement for a full description of the attorneys’ fees, costs, and Reimbursement Awards that the Parties have agreed to under the Settlement, subject to Court approval. What are your options regarding the Settlement and how to appear or object? The Court granted preliminary approval of the Settlement on July 12, 2019.

Jackson at the San Francisco Superior Courthouse, Department 613, 400 McAllister Street, San Francisco, California 94102 (the ""Settlement Hearing""), to determine whether (i) the Settlement of the Action on the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulation is fair, reasonable and adequate to Wells Fargo shareholders and to Wells Fargo and should be approved by the Court; (ii) Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s and Plaintiff Joan Herron’s Counsel’s Fee Applications and Plaintiffs’ and Herron’s Reimbursement Awards should be granted; and (iii) a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal should be entered herein. Because this is a shareholder derivative action brought for the benefit of Wells Fargo, no individual Wells Fargo shareholder has the right to receive any individual compensation as a result of the settlement of this action.

The deadline to object is September 17, 2019, and any objection must be filed or mailed with a postmark date by that date.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND OF ACTION On September 13, 2016, Plaintiff William Sarsfield initiated these derivative proceedings by making a formal demand, pursuant to California’s Corporations Code, to inspect the books and records of Wells Fargo. Sarsfield’s demand followed the Bank’s September 8, 2016 disclosure of issues relating to its sales practices and fines by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau relating to these sales practices. Beginning on September 21, 2016, several shareholder derivative complaints were filed in San Francisco County Superior Court against the Director and Officer Defendants and Wells Fargo (as nominal defendant), alleging, among other things, unlawful conduct relating to fictitious customer accounts created at Wells Fargo, and that certain of the Director and Officer Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Wells Fargo in connection with these actions or omissions, and engaged in insider trading and were unjustly enriched with respect to this alleged conduct. Plaintiffs also alleged that the Company’s Board failed to act on alleged ""red flag"" warnings of illegal conduct and to exercise appropriate risk management and oversight of the Bank, allegedly resulting in Wells Fargo opening accounts without consumers’ consent, funding the accounts through unauthorized transfers of funds, submitting credit card applications and - 5 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 issuing debit cards without consumers’ consent, and enrolling consumers in online-banking services without their consent. Plaintiffs further alleged that the Director and Officer Defendants engaged in breaches of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, and insider trading dating back to 2005 and continuing through 2016, allegedly resulting in significant damages to the Bank based on harm to goodwill, as well as fines and penalties paid to federal regulators and class action plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sought various forms of relief, including monetary damages, restitution and disgorgement of compensation earned by the Director and Officer Defendants from the challenged practices, and corporate governance reforms at Wells Fargo. The Court then entered a stipulation and order consolidating the derivative actions under the above-titled caption, In re Wells Fargo & Company Derivative Litigation , Lead Case No. CGC-16-554407. On November 22, 2016, the Court appointed Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy as lead counsel for the derivative plaintiffs in the Action. The Court also set a schedule for the filing of a Consolidated Complaint and any demurrers thereto. On January 12, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Complaint. In addition to naming Wells Fargo as a nominal defendant, Plaintiffs again sued the Director and Officer Defendants. Plaintiffs alleged that Wells Fargo employees created millions of fake accounts in order to meet unrealistic sales goals, and harmed the Bank’s customers. Plaintiffs also again alleged that the Company’s Board failed to act on alleged warnings of illegal conduct and to exercise appropriate risk management and oversight of the Bank, allegedly resulting in Wells Fargo opening accounts without consumers’ consent, funding the accounts through unauthorized transfers of funds, submitting credit card applications and issuing debit cards without consumers’ consent, and enrolling consumers in online-banking services without their consent. Plaintiffs’ allegations covered conduct dating back to 2005 and continuing through 2016, and alleged damages to the Bank based on harm to goodwill, as well as fines and penalties paid to federal regulators and class action plaintiffs. - 6 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Complaint asserted causes of action for (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) unjust enrichment, (3) corporate waste, (4) abuse of control, (5) gross mismanagement, and (6) insider trading in violation of California Corporations Code section 25402. In March 2017, Wells Fargo filed a demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Complaint, asserting that Plaintiffs should have made a pre-suit demand on the Board to evaluate their claims, and that Plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged why a pre-suit demand would have been futile. The Director and Officer Defendants separately demurred to some or all of Plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs opposed the demurrers, asserting the Consolidated Complaint contained sufficient facts to show that demand was futile and that the directors disregarded reports and other red flags and failed to monitor and stop Wells Fargo’s illegal practices, in breach of their fiduciary duties. On May 10, 2017, after extensive briefing and argument, the Court sustained Defendants’ first set of demurrers with leave to amend as to demand futility and the underlying causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and corporate waste. The Court dismissed without leave to amend the claims for abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and insider trading under California Corporations Code § 25402, which the Court held were governed by Delaware law under the internal affairs doctrine. On June 14, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandate from that portion of the Court’s demurrer order dismissing insider trading claims under the California Corporations Code. The writ was denied by the Court of Appeal on August 17, 2017, without prejudice to the issue of potential liability pursuant to the California insider-trading statute being raised on appeal from a final judgment. In May 2017, Wells Fargo made a production of internal ""books and records"" to Plaintiffs pursuant to an inspection demand served under Delaware law. Plaintiffs reviewed the documents produced by Wells Fargo for incorporation into the Amended Complaint. On June 9, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint in this Action. The Amended Complaint added allegations that the Director and Officer Defendants had contemporaneous knowledge of illegal sales practices and recklessly or intentionally failed to stop them, in breach - 7 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 of their fiduciary duties. The Amended Complaint referred to Wells Fargo’s Board minutes and internal records, communications with regulators, pleadings in other actions, news articles, and consent orders with Wells Fargo’s regulators, and alleged a new insider trading cause of action under Delaware law. Plaintiffs alleged that the illegal sales practices dated back far prior to 2011 and at least to 2002. In July 2017, Defendants demurred to the Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs in the derivative actions that had been filed in federal court against certain of Wells Fargo’s current and former officers and directors and consolidated as Shaev v. Baker , Case No. 16-cv-05541-JST (the ""Federal Derivative Action"") also moved to intervene and stay this Action. On July 10, 2017, the Court issued an order indicating that the Court intended to grant the motion and enter a stay, but asking for further briefing. On July 28, 2017, the Court entered a temporary general stay. Because of the stay, the demurrers to the Amended Complaint were not ruled on by the Court. On November 30, 2017, the Court issued an order modifying the stay to allow Plaintiffs to proceed on claims that did not overlap with the Federal Derivative Action. Specifically, Plaintiffs were permitted to proceed on: (1) insider trading claims under Delaware law; and (2) all other claims to the extent they involved the time period not implicated by the Federal Derivative Action (pre-2011 misconduct) and damages prior to 2011. At the Court’s direction, Plaintiffs identified the operative paragraphs of the Amended Complaint referring to these discrete theories and damages. On January 30, 2018, Plaintiff Herron, represented by Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP (""Herron’s Counsel""), filed a shareholder derivative complaint in San Mateo County Superior Court, captioned Herron v. Stumpf , et al., 18-CIV-00466 (San Mateo County Superior Court) (the "" Herron Action""), against certain Individual Defendants and Wells Fargo, as nominal defendant, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Section 25402 of the California Corporations Code, breach of the duty of loyalty related to Improper Sales Practices, and that her written demand on the Wells Fargo Board dated September 23, 2016 (as supplemented by letter dated April 8, 2017) was wrongfully refused. On February 20, 2018, an amended complaint was filed in the Herron Action. The Herron Action alleges claims substantially similar to those raised in Plaintiffs’ - 8 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 Amended Complaint, but also names as defendants the Additional Director/Officer Defendants. Wells Fargo and the Director and Officer Defendants filed demurrers to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint on February 9, 2018. Defendants again argued that Plaintiffs failed to adequately plead demand futility or any claims against the Director and Officer Defendants. Plaintiffs filed briefs opposing these demurrers. On April 25, 2018, the Court issued an order sustaining the demurrers with leave to amend, holding that Plaintiffs had failed to adequately plead demand futility. Because the Court had earlier stayed the action to the extent Plaintiffs’ claims were based on conduct that occurred in or after 2011, the Court declined to consider such conduct for purposes of assessing whether Plaintiffs adequately had alleged demand futility as to claims arising out of pre-2011 conduct. The Court also requested supplemental briefing on whether it should impose a general stay in the case. The parties submitted supplemental memoranda on May 9, 2018. On May 14, 2018, the Court issued an order staying the entire action indefinitely. The Herron Action was coordinated with the California State Derivative Action under case number CJC-18-004966 (San Francisco Superior Court) and on July 11, 2018, the San Francisco Superior Court stayed the Herron Action. In addition to the Action, other derivative litigations (together with the Action, the ""Improper Sales Practices Derivative Actions"") brought purportedly on behalf of Wells Fargo and against some or all of the Director Defendants, the Officer Defendants, or the Additional Director/Officer Defendants (collectively, the ""Individual Defendants""), alleging the same or a similar course of conduct, and in some cases alleging certain other claims, were filed in various other jurisdictions. III. THE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS Beginning in October 2018, the Parties engaged in extensive, arm’s-length negotiations regarding a potential resolution of the Action, using the assistance of independent mediators, the Honorable Daniel Weinstein (ret.) and Mr. Jed Melnick, Esq, who also oversaw the mediation of the Federal Derivative Action, as well as the mediation of derivative actions challenging Wells Fargo’s practices in the placement of automobile collateral protection insurance coverage (""CPI - 9 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 Derivative Actions""). Based on the Court’s rulings in this Action, the Plaintiffs in this Action focused on conduct prior to 2011 while the Federal Derivative Action focused on conduct from 2011 going forward. The CPI Derivative Actions related to automobile and home lending practices at Wells Fargo. The Parties’ mediation efforts culminated in mediators’ proposals for settlements of both the Federal Derivative Action and this Action, which included as components recognition for certain compensation-related actions (""Clawbacks"") and corporate governance reforms at the Bank (the ""Corporate Governance Reforms""), which are further described in the Stipulation. The mediators’ proposals also required the contemporaneous resolution of the CPI Derivative Actions, which are further described in the Stipulation. After further discussion, the Parties accepted the mediators’ proposals. On June 14, 2019, the Parties executed the Stipulation which sets forth the complete terms of the Settlement. On July 12, 2019, the Court entered an order preliminarily approving the Settlement, setting a schedule for the Court’s final review of the Settlement, and establishing customary notice and objection procedures for Wells Fargo shareholders. IV. BENEFITS TO WELLS FARGO FROM THE SETTLEMENT Working in conjunction with the independent mediators, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel engaged in arm’s-length negotiations with counsel for Wells Fargo and the Defendants with a view to achieving the benefits of the Settlement. The Settlement provides several benefits to Wells Fargo. First , the Settlement recognizes Wells Fargo’s agreement and acknowledgment that facts alleged in the Action were significant factors taken into account by Wells Fargo in conducting its investigation respecting Improper Sales Practices and in recommending or taking actions concerning the forfeitures of approximately $60 million in equity awards from the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, John G. Stumpf, and former Senior Executive Vice President and head of Community Banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. Second, the Settlement recognizes Wells Fargo’s agreement and acknowledgment that - 10 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 facts alleged in the complaints in the Action and certain proposals made by Plaintiffs were significant and contributing factors taken into account by Wells Fargo in implementing several corporate governance reforms that should improve the Company’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations and enhance the Board’s oversight of the Company’s compliance function. Third, the Settlement requires that Wells Fargo maintain certain of these corporate governance reforms in substantially the same form for at least the next three years, subject to and to the extent consistent with the Board’s assessment of its fiduciary duties. Further details regarding the corporate governance reforms and the maintenance and funding requirements are set forth in Exhibit A to the Settlement. Finally, the Settlement was part of an effort to resolve all derivative actions brought in both state and federal court asserting derivative claims regarding Improper Sales Practices and the placement of automobile collateral protection insurance (""CPI""). The separately negotiated settlement of the federal Improper Sales Practices derivative claims calls for a $240 million payment, which the Company will receive upon resolution of all of the derivative actions, and other benefits to Wells Fargo, and the separately negotiated settlement of the CPI Derivative Actions calls for additional corporate governance reforms. The Settlement in this Action is conditioned on final approval by the federal court of the settlement of the Federal Derivative Action, where the court is separately considering a motion for final approval, and resolution of the CPI Derivative Actions. As set forth in the Declaration of Professor Daniel J. Morrissey submitted to the Court in connection with seeking approval of the Settlement, although it is difficult to assign a precise dollar value to the corporate governance reforms in the Settlement, the economic benefits to Wells Fargo are substantial and will generate substantial value and goodwill for Wells Fargo and will positively impact Wells Fargo’s capitalization and stock price. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel believe that the Settlement provides an excellent outcome for Wells Fargo based upon the claims asserted against the Defendants, the evidence developed, and the recoverable damages that might be proven at trial. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel have concluded that the terms and conditions of the Settlement are - 11 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 fair, reasonable and adequate to the Company and its shareholders, and in their best interests, and have agreed to settle the claims asserted in the Action pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Stipulation, after considering: (i) the substantial benefits that the Company and its shareholders will receive from the settlement of the Action; (ii) the attendant risks of continued litigation against the Defendants, especially in complex actions such as this Action, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation; and (iii) the desirability of permitting the Settlement to be consummated, as provided by the terms of the Stipulation. Wells Fargo has acknowledged the substantial benefits conferred upon it by the Settlement, including from the $60 million in Clawbacks and the implementation of the Corporate Governance Reforms. V. DEFENDANTS’ DENIALS OF WRONGDOING Defendants have denied and continue to deny each and every one of the claims and contentions alleged in the Action and the Improper Sales Practices Derivative Actions. The Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing or liability against them or any of them arising out of, based upon or related to any of the conduct, statements, acts or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Improper Sales Practices Derivative Actions, and contend that many of the factual allegations in the Action and the Improper Sales Practices Derivative Actions are untrue and materially inaccurate. The Defendants have further asserted and continue to assert that, at all relevant times, they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Wells Fargo and its shareholders. Nonetheless, the Defendants also have taken into account the expense, uncertainty and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex cases like the Action. Therefore, the Defendants have determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the Action and all of the claims and allegations asserted therein, and all of the Parties’ disputes related thereto, be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation. Pursuant to the terms set forth below, the Stipulation (including all of the Exhibits thereto) shall in no event be construed as or deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession by the Defendants with respect to any claim of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or damage whatsoever. - 12 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 VI. TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT The full terms and conditions of the Settlement are embodied in the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, which is on file with the Court. The following is only a summary of the Stipulation. In consideration of the full settlement, satisfaction, compromise and release of the Released Claims, the Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo agree and acknowledge that facts alleged in the Action were significant factors taken into account in conducting the investigation respecting Improper Sales Practices and in recommending or taking certain actions with respect to the Clawbacks and that facts alleged in the complaints in the Action and subsequent amendments thereto, as well as certain proposals made by Plaintiffs in connection with the prosecution and proposed resolution of the Action, were significant and contributing factors taken into account by Wells Fargo in implementing Corporate Governance Reforms that should serve to improve the Company’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations and enhance Board oversight of the Company’s compliance function. VII. DISMISSALS AND RELEASES The Stipulation provides that, subject to approval by the Court, for good and valuable consideration, the Action shall be dismissed on the merits with prejudice as to all Defendants, and Wells Fargo (on behalf of itself and each of its Related Parties) and by operation of law Wells Fargo’s shareholders shall and do completely, fully, finally and forever release, relinquish, settle, discharge, and dismiss each and all of the Released Parties from and with respect to any and all of the Released Claims. The full text of the Release and all pertinent definitions, including the definitions of Released Parties, Released Claims and Unknown Claims, can be found at pages 12-19 and 20-21 of the Settlement Agreement. VIII. ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND PLAINTIFFS’ REIMBURSEMENT AWARDS To date, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel have not received any payment for their services in prosecuting the Action. The fee requested by Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel would compensate counsel for their efforts in achieving the benefits for the Company described in detail in the Stipulation and for their risk in undertaking this representation - 13 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 on a contingency basis. After negotiating and reaching agreement on the principal terms of the Settlement, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Wells Fargo, with the assistance of mediators Judge Weinstein and Jed Melnick, separately negotiated what they believe is an appropriate amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses to be paid by Wells Fargo to compensate Plaintiffs’ Counsel for their work in the Action and the substantial benefits that they and Wells Fargo believe Plaintiffs’ Counsel have conferred upon Wells Fargo and its stockholders by the Settlement. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Wells Fargo ultimately adopted the mediators’ proposal of $7,750,000 as an appropriate amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses, subject to Court approval. Wells Fargo also agreed to pay Herron’s Counsel $420,000 in attorneys’ fees and expenses to compensate Herron’s Counsel for its work in the action and its contributions to the Settlement consideration achieved for the benefit of Wells Fargo, subject to Court approval. As part of the Settlement Hearing, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel intend to apply to the Court for an award of fees, expenses, and Reimbursement Awards (as defined in the Stipulation) in connection with the Action which shall not exceed these negotiated amounts (the ""Fee Applications""). The Reimbursement Awards shall not exceed $10,000 for each of the Plaintiffs and Herron, with any such award to be paid out of any attorneys’ fees awarded by the Court. Wells Fargo agrees that Plaintiffs, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel, and Herron’s Counsel are entitled to the negotiated amounts as an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, and Reimbursement Awards. The Settlement, however, is not conditioned on the Court granting the Fee Applications or awarding any particular amount of attorneys’ fees, expenses, or Reimbursement Awards. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall allocate any fee and expense award among the other Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the Action in a manner which they, in good faith, believe reflects their respective contributions in the institution, prosecution, and settlement of the Action. Defendants and their counsel shall have no responsibility for, and no liability whatsoever with respect to, the allocation between or among Plaintiffs’ Counsel of any fees or expenses awarded by the Court. Any dispute regarding any allocation of fees or expenses between or among Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall have no effect on the Settlement. - 14 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 The Fee Applications and information regarding the hearing to consider the Fee Applications will be made available at www.wellsfargosalesderivativesettlement.com or by calling (877) 865-5287. IX. SETTLEMENT HEARING The Court has scheduled the Settlement Hearing for October 9, 2019 at 2:00 p.m., Pacific Standard Time, at the San Francisco Superior Courthouse, 400 McAllister Street, San Francisco, California 94102, Department 613, before the Hon. Teri L. Jackson, to: (i) determine whether the Settlement of the Action on the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulation is fair, reasonable and adequate to the Wells Fargo shareholders and to Wells Fargo and should be approved by the Court; (ii) determine whether the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal should be entered in the Action pursuant to the Stipulation; (iii) determine whether Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s and Herron’s Counsel’s Fee Applications and Plaintiffs’ and Herron’s Reimbursement Awards should be approved; (iv) hear and address any objections to the Settlement; and (v) rule on such other matters as the Court may deem appropriate. The Court has reserved the right to adjourn the Settlement Hearing or any adjournment thereof, without further notice of any kind to Wells Fargo shareholders. The Court has also reserved the right to approve the Settlement at or after the Settlement Hearing with such modification(s) as may be consented to by the Parties to the Stipulation and without further notice to Wells Fargo shareholders. X. RIGHT TO APPEAR AND OBJECT If you wish to object to any aspect of the Settlement, the Fee Applications, the Reimbursement Awards, or the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal, you must provide in writing your full name, appropriate proof of your Wells Fargo stock ownership as of the Record Date, the basis for your objection, and your signature or your attorney’s signature. You may not ask the Court to order a larger settlement; the Court can only approve or deny the Settlement. You may also appear at the Settlement Hearing, either in person or through your own attorney. If you appear through your own attorney, you are responsible for paying that attorney. - 15 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 All objections to the Settlement, the Fee Applications and the Reimbursement Awards shall be either (1) submitted to the Court either by mailing them to the Clerk of the Court, or by filing them in person at any location of the Court, OR (2) mailed to Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel, c/o In re Wells Fargo & Co. Improper Sales Practices Derivative Action, Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy , 840 Malcolm Road, Suite 200, Burlingame, California 94010 (in which case, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall then file the objections with the Court on your behalf). The deadline to submit objections is September 17, 2019 and any objections must be filed or postmarked no later than that date. All written objections and supporting papers must also clearly identify the case name and number ( In re Wells Fargo & Company Derivative Litigation , Lead Case No. CGC-16-554407 (S.F. Super.)). Any Wells Fargo shareholder who fails to object in the manner described above shall be deemed to have waived the right to object (including any right of appeal) and shall forever be foreclosed from raising such objection to the fairness, reasonableness or adequacy of the Settlement as incorporated in the Stipulation, to the award of attorneys’ fees to Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel, and to Plaintiffs’ Reimbursement Awards, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, but shall otherwise be bound by the Preliminary Approval Order, the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal to be entered, and the releases to be given. In addition, under California law, the act of objecting alone may be insufficient to preserve the right to appeal from any award of attorneys’ fees or Reimbursement Awards or from the Court’s entry of the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal. Hernandez v. Restoration Hardware , Inc. (2018) 4 Cal.5th 260. XI. ORDER AND FINAL JUDGMENT OF THE COURT If the Court determines that the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, the Parties will ask the Court to enter a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal, which will, among other things: 1. Approve the Settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate to Wells Fargo and its shareholders; - 16 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 2.

Release and discharge the Released Parties from any and all liability with respect to the Released Claims; and 4. Permanently bar and enjoin the institution or prosecution against the Released Parties of any action asserting or relating in any way to the Released Claims. XII.

OVERVIEW OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND KEY RIGHTS AND DEADLINES The Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Francisco (the ""Court"") issued an Order on July 12, 2019 granting preliminary approval of a proposed settlement (the ""Settlement"") that has been reached among (i) certain shareholders of Wells Fargo & Company (""Wells Fargo"" or the ""Company"" or the ""Bank"") who are plaintiffs (the ""Plaintiffs"") in the above-titled shareholder derivative litigation (the ""Action"") and are suing derivatively on behalf of Wells Fargo; (ii) certain Wells Fargo officers and directors, who are defendants in the Action (the ""Individual Defendants""); and (iii) Wells Fargo, which is a nominal defendant on whose behalf Plaintiffs have brought the claims in the Action. As discussed below, you have the right to object to the Settlement and the deadline for doing so is September 17, 2019. Who are the named Parties? The Plaintiffs in the Action are: William C. Sarsfield, Franklin Chin, Amy Cook, Monique Frese, Dustin Roth Granger, Vladimir Gusinsky, as Trustee of the Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust, Terence J. Keeley, as Trustee of the Barbara F. and Terence J. Keeley Revocable Living Trust, Dennis Palkon, Christian Aurelio Reyes III, William Russell and Juanita Russell, Trustees of the William and Juanita Russell Trust, David L. Underwood, and Joan Herron. - 1 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 The Individual Defendants in the Action are: John D. Baker II, Elaine L. Chao, John S. Chen, Lloyd H. Dean, Elizabeth A. Duke, Susan E. Engel, Enrique Hernandez, Jr., Donald M. James, Cynthia H. Milligan, Federico F. Peña, James H. Quigley, Stephen W. Sanger, Susan G. Swenson and Suzanne M. Vautrinot (collectively, the ""Director Defendants""); John G. Stumpf, Timothy J. Sloan, Carrie Tolstedt and John R. Shrewsberry (collectively, the ""Officer Defendants""); and Richard D. McCormick, Mackey J. McDonald, Nicholas G. Moore, Philip J. Quigley, Howard V. Richardson, Judith M. Runstad, and Michael J. Loughlin (collectively, the ""Additional Director/Officer Defendants""). Nominal defendant Wells Fargo and the Individual Defendants are together referred to in this notice as the ""Defendants."" The Defendants and Plaintiffs are together referred to as the ""Parties."" What are the Claims in the case that are being settled and released? The alleged conduct at issue in this Action is Improper Sales Practices (defined below), which includes the opening of accounts without customer knowledge or authorization by some employees of the Company’s retail bank. Plaintiffs allege that certain of the Director and Officer Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Wells Fargo in connection with, and engaged in insider trading and were unjustly enriched with respect to, these alleged Improper Sales Practices. The Defendants have denied all of these claims and allegations. The Parties reached a settlement agreement on June 14, 2019 and executed a Stipulation setting forth the complete terms of the Settlement, which are the subject of this Notice. As set forth more fully below, the claims that are being released on behalf of all Wells Fargo shareholders as part of the Settlement include, among others, all claims that were brought or could be brought by the Plaintiffs or other Wells Fargo shareholders derivatively on behalf of Wells Fargo against the Defendants (and certain other related persons or entities) that relate to the claims and allegations in this Action and the Herron action (defined below), including claims concerning the alleged Improper Sales Practices. Please read this entire Notice and the Settlement for a full description of the claims that are being released through the Settlement. What are the benefits to Wells Fargo of the Settlement? As set forth more fully in the Settlement, the Settlement provides the following benefits to - 2 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 Wells Fargo. First , Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo have agreed and acknowledged that facts and allegations in this Action were significant factors taken into account in conducting the investigation respecting Improper Sales Practices and in recommending or taking actions concerning the forfeitures of approximately $60 million in equity awards from the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, John G. Stumpf, and former Senior Executive Vice President and head of Community Banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. Second , Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo have agreed and acknowledged that facts alleged in this Action and proposals made by Plaintiffs in connection with the prosecution and proposed resolution of this Action were significant and contributing factors taken into account by Wells Fargo in implementing a series of corporate governance reforms intended to address and prevent a future occurrence of the unlawful conduct alleged in the Action. As detailed in the Settlement, these reforms include, among other things, (i) the separation of the roles of Board Chair and CEO; (ii) the addition of several new directors to the Board; (iii) the appointment of new directors to serve on (and new leaders to chair) the Board’s key committees, including the Risk Committee, Human Resources Committee (""HRC""), and the Governance and Nominating Committee; (iv) changes to the Risk Committee’s makeup and oversight responsibilities (with a new subcommittee formed for oversight of compliance); and (v) the implementation of new compensation and performance management programs in the Community Bank focused on the customer experience. Third , this Settlement was resolved as part of an effort to resolve all derivative actions brought in both state and federal court asserting derivative claims regarding both Improper Sales Practices and claims regarding the placement of automobile collateral protection insurance coverage. In addition to the corporate governance reforms discussed above, the separately negotiated settlement of the federal Improper Sales Practices derivative claims calls for a $240 million payment and other benefits to Wells Fargo, which the Company will receive upon resolution of all the derivative actions.

CGC-16-554407 to apply to the Court for an award of fees, expenses, and Reimbursement Awards (as defined in the Stipulation) in connection with the Action which shall not exceed the amounts negotiated with Wells Fargo. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Wells Fargo have agreed that Wells Fargo shall pay $7,750,000 as an appropriate amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses to Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel for their work in connection with bringing this Action and the relief obtained, subject to Court approval. Wells Fargo also has agreed to pay $420,000 as an appropriate amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses to compensate Herron’s Counsel for its work in the action and its contributions to the Settlement, subject to Court approval. Wells Fargo also has agreed to Reimbursement Awards (defined below), not to exceed $10,000 each, to be paid to Plaintiffs and Herron, with any such award to be paid out of any attorneys’ fees awarded by the Court. Please read this entire Notice and the Settlement for a full description of the attorneys’ fees, costs, and Reimbursement Awards that the Parties have agreed to under the Settlement, subject to Court approval. What are your options regarding the Settlement and how to appear or object? The Court granted preliminary approval of the Settlement on July 12, 2019.

Jackson at the San Francisco Superior Courthouse, Department 613, 400 McAllister Street, San Francisco, California 94102 (the ""Settlement Hearing""), to determine whether (i) the Settlement of the Action on the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulation is fair, reasonable and adequate to Wells Fargo shareholders and to Wells Fargo and should be approved by the Court; (ii) Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s and Plaintiff Joan Herron’s Counsel’s Fee Applications and Plaintiffs’ and Herron’s Reimbursement Awards should be granted; and (iii) a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal should be entered herein.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND OF ACTION On September 13, 2016, Plaintiff William Sarsfield initiated these derivative proceedings by making a formal demand, pursuant to California’s Corporations Code, to inspect the books and records of Wells Fargo. Sarsfield’s demand followed the Bank’s September 8, 2016 disclosure of issues relating to its sales practices and fines by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau relating to these sales practices. Beginning on September 21, 2016, several shareholder derivative complaints were filed in San Francisco County Superior Court against the Director and Officer Defendants and Wells Fargo (as nominal defendant), alleging, among other things, unlawful conduct relating to fictitious customer accounts created at Wells Fargo, and that certain of the Director and Officer Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Wells Fargo in connection with these actions or omissions, and engaged in insider trading and were unjustly enriched with respect to this alleged conduct. Plaintiffs also alleged that the Company’s Board failed to act on alleged ""red flag"" warnings of illegal conduct and to exercise appropriate risk management and oversight of the Bank, allegedly resulting in Wells Fargo opening accounts without consumers’ consent, funding the accounts through unauthorized transfers of funds, submitting credit card applications and - 5 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 issuing debit cards without consumers’ consent, and enrolling consumers in online-banking services without their consent. Plaintiffs further alleged that the Director and Officer Defendants engaged in breaches of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, and insider trading dating back to 2005 and continuing through 2016, allegedly resulting in significant damages to the Bank based on harm to goodwill, as well as fines and penalties paid to federal regulators and class action plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sought various forms of relief, including monetary damages, restitution and disgorgement of compensation earned by the Director and Officer Defendants from the challenged practices, and corporate governance reforms at Wells Fargo. The Court then entered a stipulation and order consolidating the derivative actions under the above-titled caption, In re Wells Fargo & Company Derivative Litigation , Lead Case No. CGC-16-554407. On November 22, 2016, the Court appointed Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy as lead counsel for the derivative plaintiffs in the Action. The Court also set a schedule for the filing of a Consolidated Complaint and any demurrers thereto. On January 12, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Complaint. In addition to naming Wells Fargo as a nominal defendant, Plaintiffs again sued the Director and Officer Defendants. Plaintiffs alleged that Wells Fargo employees created millions of fake accounts in order to meet unrealistic sales goals, and harmed the Bank’s customers. Plaintiffs also again alleged that the Company’s Board failed to act on alleged warnings of illegal conduct and to exercise appropriate risk management and oversight of the Bank, allegedly resulting in Wells Fargo opening accounts without consumers’ consent, funding the accounts through unauthorized transfers of funds, submitting credit card applications and issuing debit cards without consumers’ consent, and enrolling consumers in online-banking services without their consent. Plaintiffs’ allegations covered conduct dating back to 2005 and continuing through 2016, and alleged damages to the Bank based on harm to goodwill, as well as fines and penalties paid to federal regulators and class action plaintiffs. - 6 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Complaint asserted causes of action for (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) unjust enrichment, (3) corporate waste, (4) abuse of control, (5) gross mismanagement, and (6) insider trading in violation of California Corporations Code section 25402. In March 2017, Wells Fargo filed a demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Complaint, asserting that Plaintiffs should have made a pre-suit demand on the Board to evaluate their claims, and that Plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged why a pre-suit demand would have been futile. The Director and Officer Defendants separately demurred to some or all of Plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs opposed the demurrers, asserting the Consolidated Complaint contained sufficient facts to show that demand was futile and that the directors disregarded reports and other red flags and failed to monitor and stop Wells Fargo’s illegal practices, in breach of their fiduciary duties. On May 10, 2017, after extensive briefing and argument, the Court sustained Defendants’ first set of demurrers with leave to amend as to demand futility and the underlying causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and corporate waste. The Court dismissed without leave to amend the claims for abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and insider trading under California Corporations Code § 25402, which the Court held were governed by Delaware law under the internal affairs doctrine. On June 14, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandate from that portion of the Court’s demurrer order dismissing insider trading claims under the California Corporations Code. The writ was denied by the Court of Appeal on August 17, 2017, without prejudice to the issue of potential liability pursuant to the California insider-trading statute being raised on appeal from a final judgment. In May 2017, Wells Fargo made a production of internal ""books and records"" to Plaintiffs pursuant to an inspection demand served under Delaware law. Plaintiffs reviewed the documents produced by Wells Fargo for incorporation into the Amended Complaint. On June 9, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint in this Action. The Amended Complaint added allegations that the Director and Officer Defendants had contemporaneous knowledge of illegal sales practices and recklessly or intentionally failed to stop them, in breach - 7 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 of their fiduciary duties. The Amended Complaint referred to Wells Fargo’s Board minutes and internal records, communications with regulators, pleadings in other actions, news articles, and consent orders with Wells Fargo’s regulators, and alleged a new insider trading cause of action under Delaware law. Plaintiffs alleged that the illegal sales practices dated back far prior to 2011 and at least to 2002. In July 2017, Defendants demurred to the Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs in the derivative actions that had been filed in federal court against certain of Wells Fargo’s current and former officers and directors and consolidated as Shaev v. Baker , Case No. 16-cv-05541-JST (the ""Federal Derivative Action"") also moved to intervene and stay this Action. On July 10, 2017, the Court issued an order indicating that the Court intended to grant the motion and enter a stay, but asking for further briefing. On July 28, 2017, the Court entered a temporary general stay. Because of the stay, the demurrers to the Amended Complaint were not ruled on by the Court. On November 30, 2017, the Court issued an order modifying the stay to allow Plaintiffs to proceed on claims that did not overlap with the Federal Derivative Action. Specifically, Plaintiffs were permitted to proceed on: (1) insider trading claims under Delaware law; and (2) all other claims to the extent they involved the time period not implicated by the Federal Derivative Action (pre-2011 misconduct) and damages prior to 2011. At the Court’s direction, Plaintiffs identified the operative paragraphs of the Amended Complaint referring to these discrete theories and damages. On January 30, 2018, Plaintiff Herron, represented by Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP (""Herron’s Counsel""), filed a shareholder derivative complaint in San Mateo County Superior Court, captioned Herron v. Stumpf , et al., 18-CIV-00466 (San Mateo County Superior Court) (the "" Herron Action""), against certain Individual Defendants and Wells Fargo, as nominal defendant, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, violation of Section 25402 of the California Corporations Code, breach of the duty of loyalty related to Improper Sales Practices, and that her written demand on the Wells Fargo Board dated September 23, 2016 (as supplemented by letter dated April 8, 2017) was wrongfully refused. On February 20, 2018, an amended complaint was filed in the Herron Action. The Herron Action alleges claims substantially similar to those raised in Plaintiffs’ - 8 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 Amended Complaint, but also names as defendants the Additional Director/Officer Defendants. Wells Fargo and the Director and Officer Defendants filed demurrers to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint on February 9, 2018. Defendants again argued that Plaintiffs failed to adequately plead demand futility or any claims against the Director and Officer Defendants. Plaintiffs filed briefs opposing these demurrers. On April 25, 2018, the Court issued an order sustaining the demurrers with leave to amend, holding that Plaintiffs had failed to adequately plead demand futility. Because the Court had earlier stayed the action to the extent Plaintiffs’ claims were based on conduct that occurred in or after 2011, the Court declined to consider such conduct for purposes of assessing whether Plaintiffs adequately had alleged demand futility as to claims arising out of pre-2011 conduct. The Court also requested supplemental briefing on whether it should impose a general stay in the case. The parties submitted supplemental memoranda on May 9, 2018. On May 14, 2018, the Court issued an order staying the entire action indefinitely. The Herron Action was coordinated with the California State Derivative Action under case number CJC-18-004966 (San Francisco Superior Court) and on July 11, 2018, the San Francisco Superior Court stayed the Herron Action. In addition to the Action, other derivative litigations (together with the Action, the ""Improper Sales Practices Derivative Actions"") brought purportedly on behalf of Wells Fargo and against some or all of the Director Defendants, the Officer Defendants, or the Additional Director/Officer Defendants (collectively, the ""Individual Defendants""), alleging the same or a similar course of conduct, and in some cases alleging certain other claims, were filed in various other jurisdictions. III. THE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS Beginning in October 2018, the Parties engaged in extensive, arm’s-length negotiations regarding a potential resolution of the Action, using the assistance of independent mediators, the Honorable Daniel Weinstein (ret.) and Mr. Jed Melnick, Esq, who also oversaw the mediation of the Federal Derivative Action, as well as the mediation of derivative actions challenging Wells Fargo’s practices in the placement of automobile collateral protection insurance coverage (""CPI - 9 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 Derivative Actions""). Based on the Court’s rulings in this Action, the Plaintiffs in this Action focused on conduct prior to 2011 while the Federal Derivative Action focused on conduct from 2011 going forward. The CPI Derivative Actions related to automobile and home lending practices at Wells Fargo. The Parties’ mediation efforts culminated in mediators’ proposals for settlements of both the Federal Derivative Action and this Action, which included as components recognition for certain compensation-related actions (""Clawbacks"") and corporate governance reforms at the Bank (the ""Corporate Governance Reforms""), which are further described in the Stipulation. The mediators’ proposals also required the contemporaneous resolution of the CPI Derivative Actions, which are further described in the Stipulation. After further discussion, the Parties accepted the mediators’ proposals. On June 14, 2019, the Parties executed the Stipulation which sets forth the complete terms of the Settlement. On July 12, 2019, the Court entered an order preliminarily approving the Settlement, setting a schedule for the Court’s final review of the Settlement, and establishing customary notice and objection procedures for Wells Fargo shareholders. IV. BENEFITS TO WELLS FARGO FROM THE SETTLEMENT Working in conjunction with the independent mediators, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel engaged in arm’s-length negotiations with counsel for Wells Fargo and the Defendants with a view to achieving the benefits of the Settlement. The Settlement provides several benefits to Wells Fargo. First , the Settlement recognizes Wells Fargo’s agreement and acknowledgment that facts alleged in the Action were significant factors taken into account by Wells Fargo in conducting its investigation respecting Improper Sales Practices and in recommending or taking actions concerning the forfeitures of approximately $60 million in equity awards from the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, John G. Stumpf, and former Senior Executive Vice President and head of Community Banking, Carrie L. Tolstedt. Second, the Settlement recognizes Wells Fargo’s agreement and acknowledgment that - 10 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 facts alleged in the complaints in the Action and certain proposals made by Plaintiffs were significant and contributing factors taken into account by Wells Fargo in implementing several corporate governance reforms that should improve the Company’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations and enhance the Board’s oversight of the Company’s compliance function. Third, the Settlement requires that Wells Fargo maintain certain of these corporate governance reforms in substantially the same form for at least the next three years, subject to and to the extent consistent with the Board’s assessment of its fiduciary duties. Further details regarding the corporate governance reforms and the maintenance and funding requirements are set forth in Exhibit A to the Settlement. Finally, the Settlement was part of an effort to resolve all derivative actions brought in both state and federal court asserting derivative claims regarding Improper Sales Practices and the placement of automobile collateral protection insurance (""CPI""). The separately negotiated settlement of the federal Improper Sales Practices derivative claims calls for a $240 million payment, which the Company will receive upon resolution of all of the derivative actions, and other benefits to Wells Fargo, and the separately negotiated settlement of the CPI Derivative Actions calls for additional corporate governance reforms. The Settlement in this Action is conditioned on final approval by the federal court of the settlement of the Federal Derivative Action, where the court is separately considering a motion for final approval, and resolution of the CPI Derivative Actions. As set forth in the Declaration of Professor Daniel J. Morrissey submitted to the Court in connection with seeking approval of the Settlement, although it is difficult to assign a precise dollar value to the corporate governance reforms in the Settlement, the economic benefits to Wells Fargo are substantial and will generate substantial value and goodwill for Wells Fargo and will positively impact Wells Fargo’s capitalization and stock price. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel believe that the Settlement provides an excellent outcome for Wells Fargo based upon the claims asserted against the Defendants, the evidence developed, and the recoverable damages that might be proven at trial. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel have concluded that the terms and conditions of the Settlement are - 11 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 fair, reasonable and adequate to the Company and its shareholders, and in their best interests, and have agreed to settle the claims asserted in the Action pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Stipulation, after considering: (i) the substantial benefits that the Company and its shareholders will receive from the settlement of the Action; (ii) the attendant risks of continued litigation against the Defendants, especially in complex actions such as this Action, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation; and (iii) the desirability of permitting the Settlement to be consummated, as provided by the terms of the Stipulation. Wells Fargo has acknowledged the substantial benefits conferred upon it by the Settlement, including from the $60 million in Clawbacks and the implementation of the Corporate Governance Reforms. V. DEFENDANTS’ DENIALS OF WRONGDOING Defendants have denied and continue to deny each and every one of the claims and contentions alleged in the Action and the Improper Sales Practices Derivative Actions. The Defendants expressly have denied and continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing or liability against them or any of them arising out of, based upon or related to any of the conduct, statements, acts or omissions alleged, or that could have been alleged, in the Improper Sales Practices Derivative Actions, and contend that many of the factual allegations in the Action and the Improper Sales Practices Derivative Actions are untrue and materially inaccurate. The Defendants have further asserted and continue to assert that, at all relevant times, they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of Wells Fargo and its shareholders. Nonetheless, the Defendants also have taken into account the expense, uncertainty and risks inherent in any litigation, especially in complex cases like the Action. Therefore, the Defendants have determined that it is desirable and beneficial that the Action and all of the claims and allegations asserted therein, and all of the Parties’ disputes related thereto, be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation. Pursuant to the terms set forth below, the Stipulation (including all of the Exhibits thereto) shall in no event be construed as or deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession by the Defendants with respect to any claim of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or damage whatsoever. - 12 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 VI. TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT The full terms and conditions of the Settlement are embodied in the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, which is on file with the Court. The following is only a summary of the Stipulation. In consideration of the full settlement, satisfaction, compromise and release of the Released Claims, the Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo agree and acknowledge that facts alleged in the Action were significant factors taken into account in conducting the investigation respecting Improper Sales Practices and in recommending or taking certain actions with respect to the Clawbacks and that facts alleged in the complaints in the Action and subsequent amendments thereto, as well as certain proposals made by Plaintiffs in connection with the prosecution and proposed resolution of the Action, were significant and contributing factors taken into account by Wells Fargo in implementing Corporate Governance Reforms that should serve to improve the Company’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations and enhance Board oversight of the Company’s compliance function. VII. DISMISSALS AND RELEASES The Stipulation provides that, subject to approval by the Court, for good and valuable consideration, the Action shall be dismissed on the merits with prejudice as to all Defendants, and Wells Fargo (on behalf of itself and each of its Related Parties) and by operation of law Wells Fargo’s shareholders shall and do completely, fully, finally and forever release, relinquish, settle, discharge, and dismiss each and all of the Released Parties from and with respect to any and all of the Released Claims. The full text of the Release and all pertinent definitions, including the definitions of Released Parties, Released Claims and Unknown Claims, can be found at pages 12-19 and 20-21 of the Settlement Agreement. VIII. ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND PLAINTIFFS’ REIMBURSEMENT AWARDS To date, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel have not received any payment for their services in prosecuting the Action. The fee requested by Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel would compensate counsel for their efforts in achieving the benefits for the Company described in detail in the Stipulation and for their risk in undertaking this representation - 13 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 on a contingency basis. After negotiating and reaching agreement on the principal terms of the Settlement, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Wells Fargo, with the assistance of mediators Judge Weinstein and Jed Melnick, separately negotiated what they believe is an appropriate amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses to be paid by Wells Fargo to compensate Plaintiffs’ Counsel for their work in the Action and the substantial benefits that they and Wells Fargo believe Plaintiffs’ Counsel have conferred upon Wells Fargo and its stockholders by the Settlement. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Wells Fargo ultimately adopted the mediators’ proposal of $7,750,000 as an appropriate amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses, subject to Court approval. Wells Fargo also agreed to pay Herron’s Counsel $420,000 in attorneys’ fees and expenses to compensate Herron’s Counsel for its work in the action and its contributions to the Settlement consideration achieved for the benefit of Wells Fargo, subject to Court approval. As part of the Settlement Hearing, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel and Herron’s Counsel intend to apply to the Court for an award of fees, expenses, and Reimbursement Awards (as defined in the Stipulation) in connection with the Action which shall not exceed these negotiated amounts (the ""Fee Applications""). The Reimbursement Awards shall not exceed $10,000 for each of the Plaintiffs and Herron, with any such award to be paid out of any attorneys’ fees awarded by the Court. Wells Fargo agrees that Plaintiffs, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel, and Herron’s Counsel are entitled to the negotiated amounts as an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses, and Reimbursement Awards. The Settlement, however, is not conditioned on the Court granting the Fee Applications or awarding any particular amount of attorneys’ fees, expenses, or Reimbursement Awards. Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall allocate any fee and expense award among the other Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the Action in a manner which they, in good faith, believe reflects their respective contributions in the institution, prosecution, and settlement of the Action. Defendants and their counsel shall have no responsibility for, and no liability whatsoever with respect to, the allocation between or among Plaintiffs’ Counsel of any fees or expenses awarded by the Court. Any dispute regarding any allocation of fees or expenses between or among Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall have no effect on the Settlement. - 14 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 The Fee Applications and information regarding the hearing to consider the Fee Applications will be made available at www.wellsfargosalesderivativesettlement.com or by calling (877) 865-5287. IX. SETTLEMENT HEARING The Court has scheduled the Settlement Hearing for October 9, 2019 at 2:00 p.m., Pacific Standard Time, at the San Francisco Superior Courthouse, 400 McAllister Street, San Francisco, California 94102, Department 613, before the Hon. Teri L. Jackson, to: (i) determine whether the Settlement of the Action on the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulation is fair, reasonable and adequate to the Wells Fargo shareholders and to Wells Fargo and should be approved by the Court; (ii) determine whether the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal should be entered in the Action pursuant to the Stipulation; (iii) determine whether Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s and Herron’s Counsel’s Fee Applications and Plaintiffs’ and Herron’s Reimbursement Awards should be approved; (iv) hear and address any objections to the Settlement; and (v) rule on such other matters as the Court may deem appropriate. The Court has reserved the right to adjourn the Settlement Hearing or any adjournment thereof, without further notice of any kind to Wells Fargo shareholders. The Court has also reserved the right to approve the Settlement at or after the Settlement Hearing with such modification(s) as may be consented to by the Parties to the Stipulation and without further notice to Wells Fargo shareholders. X. RIGHT TO APPEAR AND OBJECT If you wish to object to any aspect of the Settlement, the Fee Applications, the Reimbursement Awards, or the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal, you must provide in writing your full name, appropriate proof of your Wells Fargo stock ownership as of the Record Date, the basis for your objection, and your signature or your attorney’s signature. You may not ask the Court to order a larger settlement; the Court can only approve or deny the Settlement. You may also appear at the Settlement Hearing, either in person or through your own attorney. If you appear through your own attorney, you are responsible for paying that attorney. - 15 - NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING NO. CGC-16-554407 All objections to the Settlement, the Fee Applications and the Reimbursement Awards shall be either (1) submitted to the Court either by mailing them to the Clerk of the Court, or by filing them in person at any location of the Court, OR (2) mailed to Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel, c/o In re Wells Fargo & Co. Improper Sales Practices Derivative Action, Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy , 840 Malcolm Road, Suite 200, Burlingame, California 94010 (in which case, Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall then file the objections with the Court on your behalf). The deadline to submit objections is September 17, 2019 and any objections must be filed or postmarked no later than that date. All written objections and supporting papers must also clearly identify the case name and number ( In re Wells Fargo & Company Derivative Litigation , Lead Case No. CGC-16-554407 (S.F. Super.)). Any Wells Fargo shareholder who fails to object in the manner described above shall be deemed to have waived the right to object (including any right of appeal) and shall forever be foreclosed from raising such objection to the fairness, reasonableness or adequacy of the Settlement as incorporated in the Stipulation, to the award of attorneys’ fees to Lead Plaintiffs’ Counsel, and to Plaintiffs’ Reimbursement Awards, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, but shall otherwise be bound by the Preliminary Approval Order, the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal to be entered, and the releases to be given. In addition, under California law, the act of objecting alone may be insufficient to preserve the right to appeal from any award of attorneys’ fees or Reimbursement Awards or from the Court’s entry of the Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal. Hernandez v. Restoration Hardware , Inc. (2018) 4 Cal.5th 260. XI. ORDER AND FINAL JUDGMENT OF THE COURT If the Court determines that the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, the Parties will ask the Court to enter a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal, which will, among other things: 1.

Financial results reported in this document are preliminary. Final financial results and other disclosures will be reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 , and may differ materially from the results and disclosures in this document due to, among other things, the completion of final review procedures, the occurrence of subsequent events, or the discovery of additional information. 1 Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity securities but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Tangible Common Equity” tables on page 36. 2 Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net charge-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net charge-offs exceed the provision for credit losses. 3 See table on page 37 for more information on Common Equity Tier 1. Common Equity Tier 1 (fully phased-in) is a preliminary estimate and is calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. - 2 - Selected Financial Information Quarter ended Jun 30, 2019 Mar 31, 2019 Jun 30, 2018 Earnings Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.30 1.20 0.98 Wells Fargo net income (in billions) 6.21 5.86 5.19 Return on assets (ROA) 1.31 % 1.26 1.10 Return on equity (ROE) 13.26 12.71 10.60 Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) (a) 15.78 15.16 12.62 Asset Quality Net charge-offs (annualized) as a % of average total loans 0.28 % 0.30 0.26 Allowance for credit losses as a % of total loans 1.12 1.14 1.18 Allowance for credit losses as a % of annualized net charge-offs 405 384 460 Other Revenue (in billions) $ 21.6 21.6 21.6 Efficiency ratio (b) 62.3 % 64.4 64.9 Average loans (in billions) $ 947.5 950.0 944.1 Average deposits (in billions) 1,269.0 1,262.1 1,271.3 Net interest margin 2.82 % 2.91 2.93 (a) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity securities but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes.

SAN FRANCISCO – Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported net income of $6.2 billion , or $1.30 per diluted common share, for second quarter 2019 , compared with $5.2 billion , or $0.98 per share, for second quarter 2018 , and $5.9 billion , or $1.20 per share, for first quarter 2019 . Interim Chief Executive Officer Allen Parker said, “In second quarter 2019, we recorded strong earnings and continued to make progress on our top priorities: focusing on our customers and team members; meeting the expectations of our regulators; and continuing the important transformation of our Company. The commitment of our team members to provide outstanding customer service was reflected in higher customer experience survey scores from our branches, continued growth in primary consumer checking customers, and an increase in referred investment assets as a result of the partnership between our Wealth and Investment Management team and our Community Banking team. During the second quarter, we formed a new Strategic Execution and Operations Office that will focus on achieving operational excellence across our businesses to enable us to execute more effectively on our regulatory priorities and further drive our transformation. Finally, our recent CCAR results demonstrated the strength of our diversified business model, our strong capital position, our sound financial risk management, and our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders in a prudent manner. I’m confident that all our stakeholders will benefit from the transformational changes we are implementing as we work to build the most customer-focused, efficient, and innovative Wells Fargo ever.” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said, “Wells Fargo reported $6.2 billion of net income in the second quarter and diluted earnings per share of $1.30 . We grew period-end loans and deposits, as well as pre-tax pre-provision profit, compared with the first quarter and a year ago. Our credit quality remained solid with net charge-offs near historic lows. Additionally, our strong capital position was reflected in our 2019 Capital Plan, which includes an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend rate in third quarter 2019 to $0.51 per share from - 3 - $0.45 per share, subject to board approval, as well as up to $23.1 billion of gross common stock repurchases during the four-quarter period beginning in third quarter 2019. ” Net Interest Income Net interest income in the second quarter was $12.1 billion , down $216 million from first quarter 2019 , driven by balance sheet mix and repricing, including the impacts of higher deposit costs and the lower interest rate environment, as well as higher mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, partially offset by the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin was 2.82% , down 9 basis points from the prior quarter due to balance sheet mix and repricing, including the impacts of higher deposit costs and the lower interest rate environment, as well as higher MBS premium amortization. Noninterest Income Noninterest income in the second quarter was $9.5 billion , up $191 million from first quarter 2019 . Second quarter noninterest income included higher trust and investment fees, other income, services charges on deposit accounts, and card fees, partially offset by lower market sensitive revenue 4 . • Service charges on deposit accounts were $1.2 billion , up from $1.1 billion in first quarter 2019, due to seasonally lower fees and higher fee waivers in the first quarter, as well as higher treasury management fees in the second quarter. • Trust and investment fees were $3.6 billion , up from $3.4 billion in first quarter 2019 , driven by higher asset-based fees on retail brokerage advisory assets reflecting higher market valuations at March 31, 2019, and higher investment banking fees on increased debt and equity underwriting. • Card fees were $1.0 billion , up from a seasonally lower first quarter of $944 million . • Mortgage banking income was $758 million , up from $708 million in first quarter 2019 . Net mortgage servicing income was $277 million , down from $364 million in the first quarter primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates including higher loan payoffs. The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations 5 decreased to 0.98% from 1.05% in the first quarter. Residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations increased in the second quarter to $33 billion from $22 billion in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonality, as well as lower mortgage loan interest rates in the second quarter. • Market sensitive revenue 4 was $871 million , down from $1.3 billion in first quarter 2019 , and included lower net gains from equity securities driven by a $258 million decrease in deferred compensation plan investment results in the second quarter (largely offset by lower employee benefits expense). Net gains from trading activities decreased $128 million compared with the prior quarter, driven by lower credit trading results. Net gains from debt securities decreased $105 million compared with the prior quarter, which included gains related to the sale of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. • Other income was $744 million and included a $721 million gain from the sale of $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans. 4 Market sensitive revenue represents net gains from trading activities, debt securities, and equity securities. 5 Production margin represents net gains on residential mortgage loan origination/sales activities divided by total residential held-for-sale mortgage originations. See the “Selected Five Quarter Residential Mortgage Production Data” table on page 42 for more information. - 4 - Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense in the second quarter declined $467 million from the prior quarter to $13.4 billion , predominantly due to a decline in employee benefits expense and incentive compensation expense, which were seasonally elevated in the first quarter, as well as a $243 million decrease in deferred compensation expense (largely offset by lower net gains from equity securities). These decreases were partially offset by higher outside professional and contract services, salary, and advertising and promotion expense. The efficiency ratio was 62.3% in second quarter 2019 , compared with 64.4% in the first quarter. Income Taxes The Company’s effective income tax rate was 17.3% for second quarter 2019. The effective income tax rate in first quarter 2019 was 13.1% and included net discrete income tax benefits of $297 million related mostly to the results of U.S. federal and state income tax examinations and the accounting for stock compensation activity. The Company currently expects the effective income tax rate for the remainder of 2019 to be approximately 18%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items. Loans Average loans were $947.5 billion in the second quarter, down $2.6 billion from the first quarter. Period-end loan balances were $949.9 billion at June 30, 2019 , up $1.6 billion from March 31, 2019 . Commercial loans were flat compared with March 31, 2019 . Consumer loans increased $1.6 billion from the prior quarter, reflecting the following: • Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans increased $1.9 billion , as $19.8 billion of held-for-investment mortgage loan originations were partially offset by paydowns, the sale of $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans, and the reclassification of $1.8 billion of mortgage loans to held for sale • Real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans decreased $1.0 billion , as paydowns continued to exceed originations • Credit card loans increased $541 million , up from a seasonally lower first quarter • Automobile loans increased $751 million , as originations of $6.3 billion outpaced paydowns, resulting in linked-quarter growth for the first time since third quarter 2016 Period-End Loan Balances (in millions) Jun 30, 2019 Mar 31, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Sep 30, 2018 Jun 30, 2018 Commercial $ 512,245 512,226 513,405 501,886 503,105 Consumer 437,633 436,023 439,705 440,414 441,160 Total loans $ 949,878 948,249 953,110 942,300 944,265 Change from prior quarter $ 1,629 (4,861 ) 10,810 (1,965 ) (3,043 ) - 5 - Debt and Equity Securities Debt securities include available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as debt securities held for trading. Period-end debt securities were $482.1 billion at June 30, 2019 , down $1.4 billion from the first quarter, predominantly due to a net decrease in available-for-sale debt securities. Debt securities purchases of approximately $15.9 billion, predominantly federal agency MBS in the available-for-sale portfolio, were more than offset by runoff and sales. Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt securities were $2.5 billion at June 30, 2019 , compared with $853 million at March 31, 2019 , primarily due to lower long-term interest rates in the second quarter. Period-end equity securities, which include marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as equity securities held for trading, were $61.5 billion at June 30, 2019 , up $3.1 billion from the first quarter. Deposits Total average deposits for second quarter 2019 were $1.3 trillion, up $6.9 billion from the prior quarter primarily due to higher retail banking deposits reflecting increased promotional activity, partially offset by lower Wealth and Investment Management deposits. The average deposit cost for second quarter 2019 was 70 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter and 30 basis points from a year ago. Capital The Company's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (fully phased-in) was 12.0% 3 and continued to exceed both the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. In second quarter 2019 , the Company repurchased 104.9 million shares of its common stock, which, net of issuances, reduced period-end common shares outstanding by 92.4 million. The Company paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.45 per share. In June 2019, the Company received a non-objection to its 2019 Capital Plan from the Federal Reserve. As part of the plan, the Company expects to increase its third quarter 2019 common stock dividend to $0.51 per share, subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors. The plan also includes up to $23.1 billion of gross common stock repurchases, subject to management discretion, for the four-quarter period from third quarter 2019 through second quarter 2020. In addition, the Company may consider redemptions or repurchases of other capital securities as part of the plan. As of June 30, 2019, our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 24.1% 6 , compared with the required minimum of 22.0%. 6 The TLAC ratio is a preliminary estimate. - 6 - Credit Quality Net Loan Charge-offs The quarterly loss rate in the second quarter was 0.28% (annualized), down from 0.30% in the prior quarter, and up from 0.26% a year ago. Commercial and consumer losses were 0.13% and 0.45% , respectively. Total credit losses were $653 million in second quarter 2019 , down $42 million from first quarter 2019 . Commercial losses increased $20 million , while consumer losses decreased $62 million primarily due to lower automobile losses.

Nonaccrual loans decreased $983 million from first quarter 2019 to $5.9 billion . Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $327 million driven by reductions in the commercial and industrial portfolio reflecting broad-based improvement across industry sectors. Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $656 million driven by lower nonaccruals in the real estate 1-4 family first mortgage portfolio, which included a $373 million decline related to the reclassification of $1.8 billion of mortgage loans to held for sale.

In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and our management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses and allowance levels; (iv) the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; (v) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (vi) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vii) future capital or liquidity levels or targets and our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III capital standards; (viii) the performance of our mortgage business and any related exposures; (ix) the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (x) future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (xi) our targeted range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xii) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiii) the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: • current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth; • our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; • financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services; • developments in our mortgage banking business, including the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive, any negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking business and any changes in industry standards; • our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters; • the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale; • significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our debt securities and equity securities portfolios; • the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses; - 14 - • negative effects from the retail banking sales practices matter and from other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal, operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified team members, and our reputation; • resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; • a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; • the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin; • fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; and • the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations (including federal securities laws and federal banking regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures . From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future results. - 15 - About Wells Fargo Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) is a diversified, community-based financial services company with $1.9 trillion in assets.

The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Tangible Common Equity” tables on page 36. (2) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). (3) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.

The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Tangible Common Equity” tables on page 36. (2) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). (3) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. (4) Consumer and small business banking deposits are total deposits excluding mortgage escrow and wholesale deposits. (5) Book value per common share is common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding. - 19 - Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME Quarter ended June 30, % Six months ended June 30, % (in millions, except per share amounts) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Interest income Debt securities $ 3,781 3,594 5 % $ 7,722 7,008 10 % Mortgage loans held for sale 195 198 (2 ) 347 377 (8 ) Loans held for sale 20 48 (58 ) 44 72 (39 ) Loans 11,316 10,912 4 22,670 21,491 5 Equity securities 236 221 7 446 452 (1 ) Other interest income 1,438 1,042 38 2,760 1,962 41 Total interest income 16,986 16,015 6 33,989 31,362 8 Interest expense Deposits 2,213 1,268 75 4,239 2,358 80 Short-term borrowings 646 398 62 1,242 709 75 Long-term debt 1,900 1,658 15 3,827 3,234 18 Other interest expense 132 150 (12 ) 275 282 (2 ) Total interest expense 4,891 3,474 41 9,583 6,583 46 Net interest income 12,095 12,541 (4 ) 24,406 24,779 (2 ) Provision for credit losses 503 452 11 1,348 643 110 Net interest income after provision for credit losses 11,592 12,089 (4 ) 23,058 24,136 (4 ) Noninterest income Service charges on deposit accounts 1,206 1,163 4 2,300 2,336 (2 ) Trust and investment fees 3,568 3,675 (3 ) 6,941 7,358 (6 ) Card fees 1,025 1,001 2 1,969 1,909 3 Other fees 800 846 (5 ) 1,570 1,646 (5 ) Mortgage banking 758 770 (2 ) 1,466 1,704 (14 ) Insurance 93 102 (9 ) 189 216 (13 ) Net gains from trading activities 229 191 20 586 434 35 Net gains on debt securities 20 41 (51 ) 145 42 245 Net gains from equity securities 622 295 111 1,436 1,078 33 Lease income 424 443 (4 ) 867 898 (3 ) Other 744 485 53 1,318 1,087 21 Total noninterest income 9,489 9,012 5 18,787 18,708 — Noninterest expense Salaries 4,541 4,465 2 8,966 8,828 2 Commission and incentive compensation 2,597 2,642 (2 ) 5,442 5,410 1 Employee benefits 1,336 1,245 7 3,274 2,843 15 Equipment 607 550 10 1,268 1,167 9 Net occupancy 719 722 — 1,436 1,435 — Core deposit and other intangibles 27 265 (90 ) 55 530 (90 ) FDIC and other deposit assessments 144 297 (52 ) 303 621 (51 ) Other 3,478 3,796 (8 ) 6,621 8,190 (19 ) Total noninterest expense 13,449 13,982 (4 ) 27,365 29,024 (6 ) Income before income tax expense 7,632 7,119 7 14,480 13,820 5 Income tax expense 1,294 1,810 (29 ) 2,175 3,184 (32 ) Net income before noncontrolling interests 6,338 5,309 19 12,305 10,636 16 Less: Net income from noncontrolling interests 132 123 7 239 314 (24 ) Wells Fargo net income $ 6,206 5,186 20 $ 12,066 10,322 17 Less: Preferred stock dividends and other 358 394 (9 ) 711 797 (11 ) Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock $ 5,848 4,792 22 $ 11,355 9,525 19 Per share information Earnings per common share $ 1.31 0.98 34 $ 2.52 1.95 29 Diluted earnings per common share 1.30 0.98 33 2.50 1.94 29 Average common shares outstanding 4,469.4 4,865.8 (8 ) 4,510.2 4,875.7 (7 ) Diluted average common shares outstanding 4,495.0 4,899.8 (8 ) 4,540.1 4,916.1 (8 ) -

Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. (2) Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, which are included in other assets. (3) Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets.

The rules are being phased in through the end of 2021. Fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, became fully phased-in. (2) Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, which are included in other assets. (3) Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end. (4) The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Under the final rules, we are subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. Because the final determination of our CET1 ratio and which approach will produce the lower CET1 ratio as of June 30, 2019 , is subject to detailed analysis of considerable data, our CET1 ratio at that date has been estimated using the Basel III definition of capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. The capital ratio for March 31, 2019, and December 31, September 30 and June 30, 2018 , was calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. (5) The Company’s June 30, 2019 , RWAs and capital ratio are preliminary estimates. - 38 - Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS (1) (income/expense in millions, average balances in billions) Community Banking Wholesale Banking Wealth and Investment Management Other (2) Consolidated Company 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Quarter ended June 30, Net interest income (3) $ 7,066 7,346 4,535 4,693 1,037 1,111 (543 ) (609 ) 12,095 12,541 Provision (reversal of provision) for credit losses 479 484 28 (36 ) (1 ) (2 ) (3 ) 6 503 452 Noninterest income 4,739 4,460 2,530 2,504 3,013 2,840 (793 ) (792 ) 9,489 9,012 Noninterest expense 7,212 7,290 3,882 4,219 3,246 3,361 (891 ) (888 ) 13,449 13,982 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 4,114 4,032 3,155 3,014 805 592 (442 ) (519 ) 7,632 7,119 Income tax expense (benefit) 838 1,413 365 379 201 147 (110 ) (129 ) 1,294 1,810 Net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests 3,276 2,619 2,790 2,635 604 445 (332 ) (390 ) 6,338 5,309 Less: Net income from noncontrolling interests 129 123 1 — 2 — — — 132 123 Net income (loss) $ 3,147 2,496 2,789 2,635 602 445 (332 ) (390 ) 6,206 5,186 Average loans $ 457.7 463.8 474.0 464.7 75.0 74.7 (59.2 ) (59.1 ) 947.5 944.1 Average assets 1,024.8 1,034.3 852.2 826.4 83.8 84.0 (60.2 ) (59.8 ) 1,900.6 1,884.9 Average deposits 777.6 760.6 410.4 414.0 143.5 167.1 (62.5 ) (70.4 ) 1,269.0 1,271.3 Six months ended June 30, Net interest income (3) $ 14,314 14,541 9,069 9,225 2,138 2,223 (1,115 ) (1,210 ) 24,406 24,779 Provision (reversal of provision) for credit losses 1,189 702 162 (56 ) 3 (8 ) (6 ) 5 1,348 643 Noninterest income 9,241 9,095 5,107 5,251 5,991 5,970 (1,552 ) (1,608 ) 18,787 18,708 Noninterest expense 14,901 15,992 7,720 8,197 6,549 6,651 (1,805 ) (1,816 ) 27,365 29,024 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 7,465 6,942 6,294 6,335 1,577 1,550 (856 ) (1,007 ) 14,480 13,820 Income tax expense (benefit) 1,262 2,222 734 827 393 386 (214 ) (251 ) 2,175 3,184 Net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests 6,203 4,720 5,560 5,508 1,184 1,164 (642 ) (756 ) 12,305 10,636 Less: Net income (loss) from noncontrolling interests 233 311 1 (2 ) 5 5 — — 239 314 Net income (loss) $ 5,970 4,409 5,559 5,510 1,179 1,159 (642 ) (756 ) 12,066 10,322 Average loans $ 457.9 467.1 475.2 464.9 74.7 74.3 (59.1 ) (58.8 ) 948.7 947.5 Average assets 1,020.1 1,048.0 848.4 827.8 83.5 84.1 (60.1 ) (59.6 ) 1,891.9 1,900.3 Average deposits 771.6 754.1 410.1 429.9 148.3 172.5 (64.5 ) (72.3 ) 1,265.5 1,284.2 (1) The management accounting process measures the performance of the operating segments based on our management structure and is not necessarily comparable with other similar information for other financial services companies.

The rules are being phased in through the end of 2021. Fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, became fully phased-in. (2) Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, which are included in other assets. (3) Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end. (4) The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Under the final rules, we are subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. Because the final determination of our CET1 ratio and which approach will produce the lower CET1 ratio as of June 30, 2019, is subject to detailed analysis of considerable data, our CET1 ratio at that date has been estimated using the Basel III definition of capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. The capital ratio for March 31, 2019, and December 31, September 30 and June 30, 2018, was calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. (5) The Company’s June 30, 2019, RWAs and capital ratio are preliminary estimates.

The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. (2) Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, which are included in other assets. (3) Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

Financial results reported in this document are preliminary. Final financial results and other disclosures will be reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 , and may differ materially from the results and disclosures in this document due to, among other things, the completion of final review procedures, the occurrence of subsequent events, or the discovery of additional information. 1 Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity securities but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Tangible Common Equity” tables on page 36. 2 Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net charge-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net charge-offs exceed the provision for credit losses. 3 See table on page 37 for more information on Common Equity Tier 1. Common Equity Tier 1 (fully phased-in) is a preliminary estimate and is calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. - 2 - Selected Financial Information Quarter ended Jun 30, 2019 Mar 31, 2019 Jun 30, 2018 Earnings Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.30 1.20 0.98 Wells Fargo net income (in billions) 6.21 5.86 5.19 Return on assets (ROA) 1.31 % 1.26 1.10 Return on equity (ROE) 13.26 12.71 10.60 Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) (a) 15.78 15.16 12.62 Asset Quality Net charge-offs (annualized) as a % of average total loans 0.28 % 0.30 0.26 Allowance for credit losses as a % of total loans 1.12 1.14 1.18 Allowance for credit losses as a % of annualized net charge-offs 405 384 460 Other Revenue (in billions) $ 21.6 21.6 21.6 Efficiency ratio (b) 62.3 % 64.4 64.9 Average loans (in billions) $ 947.5 950.0 944.1 Average deposits (in billions) 1,269.0 1,262.1 1,271.3 Net interest margin 2.82 % 2.91 2.93 (a) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity securities but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes.

SAN FRANCISCO – Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported net income of $6.2 billion , or $1.30 per diluted common share, for second quarter 2019 , compared with $5.2 billion , or $0.98 per share, for second quarter 2018 , and $5.9 billion , or $1.20 per share, for first quarter 2019 . Interim Chief Executive Officer Allen Parker said, “In second quarter 2019, we recorded strong earnings and continued to make progress on our top priorities: focusing on our customers and team members; meeting the expectations of our regulators; and continuing the important transformation of our Company. The commitment of our team members to provide outstanding customer service was reflected in higher customer experience survey scores from our branches, continued growth in primary consumer checking customers, and an increase in referred investment assets as a result of the partnership between our Wealth and Investment Management team and our Community Banking team. During the second quarter, we formed a new Strategic Execution and Operations Office that will focus on achieving operational excellence across our businesses to enable us to execute more effectively on our regulatory priorities and further drive our transformation. Finally, our recent CCAR results demonstrated the strength of our diversified business model, our strong capital position, our sound financial risk management, and our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders in a prudent manner. I’m confident that all our stakeholders will benefit from the transformational changes we are implementing as we work to build the most customer-focused, efficient, and innovative Wells Fargo ever.” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said, “Wells Fargo reported $6.2 billion of net income in the second quarter and diluted earnings per share of $1.30 . We grew period-end loans and deposits, as well as pre-tax pre-provision profit, compared with the first quarter and a year ago. Our credit quality remained solid with net charge-offs near historic lows. Additionally, our strong capital position was reflected in our 2019 Capital Plan, which includes an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend rate in third quarter 2019 to $0.51 per share from - 3 - $0.45 per share, subject to board approval, as well as up to $23.1 billion of gross common stock repurchases during the four-quarter period beginning in third quarter 2019. ” Net Interest Income Net interest income in the second quarter was $12.1 billion , down $216 million from first quarter 2019 , driven by balance sheet mix and repricing, including the impacts of higher deposit costs and the lower interest rate environment, as well as higher mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, partially offset by the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin was 2.82% , down 9 basis points from the prior quarter due to balance sheet mix and repricing, including the impacts of higher deposit costs and the lower interest rate environment, as well as higher MBS premium amortization. Noninterest Income Noninterest income in the second quarter was $9.5 billion , up $191 million from first quarter 2019 . Second quarter noninterest income included higher trust and investment fees, other income, services charges on deposit accounts, and card fees, partially offset by lower market sensitive revenue 4 . • Service charges on deposit accounts were $1.2 billion , up from $1.1 billion in first quarter 2019, due to seasonally lower fees and higher fee waivers in the first quarter, as well as higher treasury management fees in the second quarter. • Trust and investment fees were $3.6 billion , up from $3.4 billion in first quarter 2019 , driven by higher asset-based fees on retail brokerage advisory assets reflecting higher market valuations at March 31, 2019, and higher investment banking fees on increased debt and equity underwriting. • Card fees were $1.0 billion , up from a seasonally lower first quarter of $944 million . • Mortgage banking income was $758 million , up from $708 million in first quarter 2019 . Net mortgage servicing income was $277 million , down from $364 million in the first quarter primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates including higher loan payoffs. The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations 5 decreased to 0.98% from 1.05% in the first quarter. Residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations increased in the second quarter to $33 billion from $22 billion in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonality, as well as lower mortgage loan interest rates in the second quarter. • Market sensitive revenue 4 was $871 million , down from $1.3 billion in first quarter 2019 , and included lower net gains from equity securities driven by a $258 million decrease in deferred compensation plan investment results in the second quarter (largely offset by lower employee benefits expense). Net gains from trading activities decreased $128 million compared with the prior quarter, driven by lower credit trading results. Net gains from debt securities decreased $105 million compared with the prior quarter, which included gains related to the sale of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. • Other income was $744 million and included a $721 million gain from the sale of $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans. 4 Market sensitive revenue represents net gains from trading activities, debt securities, and equity securities. 5 Production margin represents net gains on residential mortgage loan origination/sales activities divided by total residential held-for-sale mortgage originations. See the “Selected Five Quarter Residential Mortgage Production Data” table on page 42 for more information. - 4 - Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense in the second quarter declined $467 million from the prior quarter to $13.4 billion , predominantly due to a decline in employee benefits expense and incentive compensation expense, which were seasonally elevated in the first quarter, as well as a $243 million decrease in deferred compensation expense (largely offset by lower net gains from equity securities). These decreases were partially offset by higher outside professional and contract services, salary, and advertising and promotion expense. The efficiency ratio was 62.3% in second quarter 2019 , compared with 64.4% in the first quarter. Income Taxes The Company’s effective income tax rate was 17.3% for second quarter 2019. The effective income tax rate in first quarter 2019 was 13.1% and included net discrete income tax benefits of $297 million related mostly to the results of U.S. federal and state income tax examinations and the accounting for stock compensation activity. The Company currently expects the effective income tax rate for the remainder of 2019 to be approximately 18%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items. Loans Average loans were $947.5 billion in the second quarter, down $2.6 billion from the first quarter. Period-end loan balances were $949.9 billion at June 30, 2019 , up $1.6 billion from March 31, 2019 . Commercial loans were flat compared with March 31, 2019 . Consumer loans increased $1.6 billion from the prior quarter, reflecting the following: • Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans increased $1.9 billion , as $19.8 billion of held-for-investment mortgage loan originations were partially offset by paydowns, the sale of $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans, and the reclassification of $1.8 billion of mortgage loans to held for sale • Real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans decreased $1.0 billion , as paydowns continued to exceed originations • Credit card loans increased $541 million , up from a seasonally lower first quarter • Automobile loans increased $751 million , as originations of $6.3 billion outpaced paydowns, resulting in linked-quarter growth for the first time since third quarter 2016 Period-End Loan Balances (in millions) Jun 30, 2019 Mar 31, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Sep 30, 2018 Jun 30, 2018 Commercial $ 512,245 512,226 513,405 501,886 503,105 Consumer 437,633 436,023 439,705 440,414 441,160 Total loans $ 949,878 948,249 953,110 942,300 944,265 Change from prior quarter $ 1,629 (4,861 ) 10,810 (1,965 ) (3,043 ) - 5 - Debt and Equity Securities Debt securities include available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as debt securities held for trading. Period-end debt securities were $482.1 billion at June 30, 2019 , down $1.4 billion from the first quarter, predominantly due to a net decrease in available-for-sale debt securities. Debt securities purchases of approximately $15.9 billion, predominantly federal agency MBS in the available-for-sale portfolio, were more than offset by runoff and sales. Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt securities were $2.5 billion at June 30, 2019 , compared with $853 million at March 31, 2019 , primarily due to lower long-term interest rates in the second quarter. Period-end equity securities, which include marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as equity securities held for trading, were $61.5 billion at June 30, 2019 , up $3.1 billion from the first quarter. Deposits Total average deposits for second quarter 2019 were $1.3 trillion, up $6.9 billion from the prior quarter primarily due to higher retail banking deposits reflecting increased promotional activity, partially offset by lower Wealth and Investment Management deposits. The average deposit cost for second quarter 2019 was 70 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter and 30 basis points from a year ago. Capital The Company's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (fully phased-in) was 12.0% 3 and continued to exceed both the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. In second quarter 2019 , the Company repurchased 104.9 million shares of its common stock, which, net of issuances, reduced period-end common shares outstanding by 92.4 million. The Company paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.45 per share. In June 2019, the Company received a non-objection to its 2019 Capital Plan from the Federal Reserve. As part of the plan, the Company expects to increase its third quarter 2019 common stock dividend to $0.51 per share, subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors. The plan also includes up to $23.1 billion of gross common stock repurchases, subject to management discretion, for the four-quarter period from third quarter 2019 through second quarter 2020. In addition, the Company may consider redemptions or repurchases of other capital securities as part of the plan. As of June 30, 2019, our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 24.1% 6 , compared with the required minimum of 22.0%. 6 The TLAC ratio is a preliminary estimate. - 6 - Credit Quality Net Loan Charge-offs The quarterly loss rate in the second quarter was 0.28% (annualized), down from 0.30% in the prior quarter, and up from 0.26% a year ago. Commercial and consumer losses were 0.13% and 0.45% , respectively. Total credit losses were $653 million in second quarter 2019 , down $42 million from first quarter 2019 . Commercial losses increased $20 million , while consumer losses decreased $62 million primarily due to lower automobile losses.

Nonaccrual loans decreased $983 million from first quarter 2019 to $5.9 billion . Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $327 million driven by reductions in the commercial and industrial portfolio reflecting broad-based improvement across industry sectors. Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $656 million driven by lower nonaccruals in the real estate 1-4 family first mortgage portfolio, which included a $373 million decline related to the reclassification of $1.8 billion of mortgage loans to held for sale.

In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and our management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses and allowance levels; (iv) the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; (v) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (vi) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vii) future capital or liquidity levels or targets and our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III capital standards; (viii) the performance of our mortgage business and any related exposures; (ix) the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (x) future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (xi) our targeted range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xii) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiii) the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: • current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth; • our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; • financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services; • developments in our mortgage banking business, including the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive, any negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking business and any changes in industry standards; • our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters; • the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale; • significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our debt securities and equity securities portfolios; • the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses; - 14 - • negative effects from the retail banking sales practices matter and from other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal, operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified team members, and our reputation; • resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; • a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; • the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin; • fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; and • the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations (including federal securities laws and federal banking regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov. Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures . From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future results. - 15 - About Wells Fargo Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) is a diversified, community-based financial services company with $1.9 trillion in assets.

(2) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). (3) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. (4) Consumer and small business banking deposits are total deposits excluding mortgage escrow and wholesale deposits. (5) Book value per common share is common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding.

The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. (2) Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, which are included in other assets. (3) Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets.

The rules are being phased in through the end of 2021. Fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, became fully phased-in. (2) Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, which are included in other assets. (3) Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end. (4) The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Under the final rules, we are subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. Because the final determination of our CET1 ratio and which approach will produce the lower CET1 ratio as of June 30, 2019 , is subject to detailed analysis of considerable data, our CET1 ratio at that date has been estimated using the Basel III definition of capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. The capital ratio for March 31, 2019, and December 31, September 30 and June 30, 2018 , was calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. (5) The Company’s June 30, 2019 , RWAs and capital ratio are preliminary estimates. - 38 - Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS (1) (income/expense in millions, average balances in billions) Community Banking Wholesale Banking Wealth and Investment Management Other (2) Consolidated Company 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Quarter ended June 30, Net interest income (3) $ 7,066 7,346 4,535 4,693 1,037 1,111 (543 ) (609 ) 12,095 12,541 Provision (reversal of provision) for credit losses 479 484 28 (36 ) (1 ) (2 ) (3 ) 6 503 452 Noninterest income 4,739 4,460 2,530 2,504 3,013 2,840 (793 ) (792 ) 9,489 9,012 Noninterest expense 7,212 7,290 3,882 4,219 3,246 3,361 (891 ) (888 ) 13,449 13,982 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 4,114 4,032 3,155 3,014 805 592 (442 ) (519 ) 7,632 7,119 Income tax expense (benefit) 838 1,413 365 379 201 147 (110 ) (129 ) 1,294 1,810 Net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests 3,276 2,619 2,790 2,635 604 445 (332 ) (390 ) 6,338 5,309 Less: Net income from noncontrolling interests 129 123 1 — 2 — — — 132 123 Net income (loss) $ 3,147 2,496 2,789 2,635 602 445 (332 ) (390 ) 6,206 5,186 Average loans $ 457.7 463.8 474.0 464.7 75.0 74.7 (59.2 ) (59.1 ) 947.5 944.1 Average assets 1,024.8 1,034.3 852.2 826.4 83.8 84.0 (60.2 ) (59.8 ) 1,900.6 1,884.9 Average deposits 777.6 760.6 410.4 414.0 143.5 167.1 (62.5 ) (70.4 ) 1,269.0 1,271.3 Six months ended June 30, Net interest income (3) $ 14,314 14,541 9,069 9,225 2,138 2,223 (1,115 ) (1,210 ) 24,406 24,779 Provision (reversal of provision) for credit losses 1,189 702 162 (56 ) 3 (8 ) (6 ) 5 1,348 643 Noninterest income 9,241 9,095 5,107 5,251 5,991 5,970 (1,552 ) (1,608 ) 18,787 18,708 Noninterest expense 14,901 15,992 7,720 8,197 6,549 6,651 (1,805 ) (1,816 ) 27,365 29,024 Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 7,465 6,942 6,294 6,335 1,577 1,550 (856 ) (1,007 ) 14,480 13,820 Income tax expense (benefit) 1,262 2,222 734 827 393 386 (214 ) (251 ) 2,175 3,184 Net income (loss) before noncontrolling interests 6,203 4,720 5,560 5,508 1,184 1,164 (642 ) (756 ) 12,305 10,636 Less: Net income (loss) from noncontrolling interests 233 311 1 (2 ) 5 5 — — 239 314 Net income (loss) $ 5,970 4,409 5,559 5,510 1,179 1,159 (642 ) (756 ) 12,066 10,322 Average loans $ 457.9 467.1 475.2 464.9 74.7 74.3 (59.1 ) (58.8 ) 948.7 947.5 Average assets 1,020.1 1,048.0 848.4 827.8 83.5 84.1 (60.1 ) (59.6 ) 1,891.9 1,900.3 Average deposits 771.6 754.1 410.1 429.9 148.3 172.5 (64.5 ) (72.3 ) 1,265.5 1,284.2 (1) The management accounting process measures the performance of the operating segments based on our management structure and is not necessarily comparable with other similar information for other financial services companies.
