Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP) is defined as earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter.

Fox-;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NOVEMBER 2, 2023 ExxonMobil Completes Acquisition of Denbury SPRING, Texas  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) today announced it has closed its acquisition of Denbury Inc. (NYSE: DEN) in an all-stock transaction valued at $4.9 billion, or $89.45 per share, based on ExxonMobils closing price on July 12, 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, Denbury shareholders will receive 0.84 shares of ExxonMobil for each Denbury share. This transaction is a major step forward in the profitable growth of our Low Carbon Solutions business, Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said. Our expertise, combined with Denburys talent and CO 2 pipeline network, expands our low-carbon leadership and best positions us to meet the decarbonization needs of industrial customers while also reducing emissions in our own operations. ExxonMobil now has the largest owned and operated CO 2 pipeline network in the U.S.  adding more than 1,300 miles, including nearly 925 miles of CO 2 pipelines in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi  located in one of the largest U.S. markets for CO 2 emissions. The company also has access to more than 15 strategically located onshore CO 2 storage sites. The acquisition also includes Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain oil and natural gas operations, consisting of proved reserves totaling more than 200 million barrels of oil equivalent as of year-end 2022, with approximately 46,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of current production. These operations provide immediate operating cash flow and optionality for carbon capture operations. Once fully developed and optimized, the combination of these assets and capabilities has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions by more than 100 million metric tons per year. For more information, the investor presentation is available at ExxonMobil Investor website . ### About ExxonMobil ExxonMobil, one of the largest publicly traded international energy and petrochemical companies, creates solutions that improve quality of life and meet societys evolving needs.

Fox","EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NOVEMBER 2, 2023 ExxonMobil Completes Acquisition of Denbury SPRING, Texas  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) today announced it has closed its acquisition of Denbury Inc. (NYSE: DEN) in an all-stock transaction valued at $4.9 billion, or $89.45 per share, based on ExxonMobils closing price on July 12, 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, Denbury shareholders will receive 0.84 shares of ExxonMobil for each Denbury share. This transaction is a major step forward in the profitable growth of our Low Carbon Solutions business, Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said. Our expertise, combined with Denburys talent and CO 2 pipeline network, expands our low-carbon leadership and best positions us to meet the decarbonization needs of industrial customers while also reducing emissions in our own operations. ExxonMobil now has the largest owned and operated CO 2 pipeline network in the U.S.  adding more than 1,300 miles, including nearly 925 miles of CO 2 pipelines in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi  located in one of the largest U.S. markets for CO 2 emissions. The company also has access to more than 15 strategically located onshore CO 2 storage sites. The acquisition also includes Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain oil and natural gas operations, consisting of proved reserves totaling more than 200 million barrels of oil equivalent as of year-end 2022, with approximately 46,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of current production. These operations provide immediate operating cash flow and optionality for carbon capture operations. Once fully developed and optimized, the combination of these assets and capabilities has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions by more than 100 million metric tons per year. For more information, the investor presentation is available at ExxonMobil Investor website . ### About ExxonMobil ExxonMobil, one of the largest publicly traded international energy and petrochemical companies, creates solutions that improve quality of life and meet societys evolving needs.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) in accordance with Subpart F of Regulation YY, issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), which implemented the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (“DFAST”) requirements for covered companies1. The results reflect certain forecasted financial measures for the nine-quarter projection period (1Q19 through 1Q21) under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve. The stress test has been conducted in accordance with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) 2019 Summary Instructions published by the Federal Reserve on March 6, 2019 (“2019 CCAR Instructions”). The results presented were calculated using forecasting models and methodologies developed by JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve conducts its own stress tests of covered companies, including JPMorgan Chase, based on forecasting models and methodologies developed by the Federal Reserve. Because of the different models and methodologies utilized by the Firm and the Federal Reserve, the results published by the Federal Reserve may vary from those disclosed herein. JPMorgan Chase may not be able to explain the differences between the results published in this report and the results published by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase's results presented herein reflect the following specific assumptions as prescribed by the DFAST rule for each of the second through ninth quarters of the projection period (“DFAST Capital Actions”)2:  Common stock dividend payments continue at the same dollar amount as the average of the prior-four quarters (2Q18 – 1Q19) and include common stock dividends attributable to issuances related to employee compensation  Scheduled dividend, interest, or principal payments for other capital instruments are paid  Repurchases of common stock and redemptions of other capital instruments are zero  Issuances of new preferred, or common stock, other than issuances of common stock related to employee compensation, are zero The results disclosed herein represent hypothetical estimates under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve and do not represent JPMorgan Chase's forecasts of actual expected gains, losses, pre-provision net revenue (""PPNR""), net income before taxes, capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), or capital ratios. A strong capital position is essential to JPMorgan Chase's business strategy and competitive position. Capital adequacy and stress testing is subject to oversight at the most senior levels of the Firm, including the Board of Directors. The Annual and Mid-Cycle DFAST stress tests are subject to a governance framework, which includes oversight by: the Board of Directors, the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee, the Capital Governance Committee, Capital & Liquidity Management, the Firmwide and line of business (“LOB”) Chief Financial Officers and Chief Risk Officers, Model Risk Governance & Review, and Internal Audit. 1 JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Stress Test Disclosure also presents results of the annual stress test conducted with respect to the Firm’s principal depository institution subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMCB”), in accordance with the DFAST regulation issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In the previous year, the Annual Stress Test Disclosure included results for two depository institutions: JPMCB and Chase Bank USA, National Association (“CUSA”). In May 2019, CUSA was merged with and into JPMCB with JPMCB as the surviving bank. The JPMCB results reflect its forecasts prior to the merger from JPMCB’s actual balance sheet and income statement from 4Q18, and do not consider the impact of the merger. CUSA results are no longer separately disclosed. 2 The first quarter of the projection period (1Q19) reflects actual capital actions (e.g., actual common stock dividends and repurchases net of issuances, and issuances and redemptions of other capital instruments) 1 2019 DFAST annual Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario summary  The Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario, as constructed and prescribed by the Federal Reserve, is characterized by a severe global recession accompanied by a period of heightened stress in commercial real estate markets and corporate debt markets Key economic variables from Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve¹  U.S. real GDP – GDP declines 8.0% between the fourth quarter of 2018 and its trough in the third quarter of 2020  U.S. inflation – The annualized rate of change in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) drops from 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 1.2% in the first quarter of 2019  U.S. unemployment rate – Unemployment rate increases by 6.2 percentage points from its level in the fourth quarter of 2018, peaking at 10% in the third quarter of 2020  Real estate prices – House prices decline 26% through the first quarter of 2021 relative to their level in the fourth quarter of 2018; commercial real estate prices decline by 35% through the first quarter of 2021 relative to their level in the fourth quarter of 2018  Equity markets – Equity prices decline by 50% between the fourth quarter of 2018 and their trough in the fourth quarter of 2019; equity market volatility peaks in the second quarter of 2019  Short-term and long-term rates – Short-term Treasury rates drop from 2.30% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 0.10% in the third quarter of 2019, where they remain for the duration of the forecast horizon; long-term Treasury rates drop from 3.00% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 0.80% in the first quarter of 2019, gradually recovering to 1.50% by the first quarter of 2021  Mortgage rates – 30-year mortgage rates fall from 4.80% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 3.90% in the first quarter of 2019.

The results of the Firm's capital stress tests reflect risks from each of these categories: Risk types Definition  Strategic risk is the risk associated with the Firm’s current and future business plans and objectives, including capital risk, liquidity risk, and the impact to the Firm’s reputation¹  Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level and composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks Strategic during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions  Liquidity risk is risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition, and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities  Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk  Consumer credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a customer Credit and  Wholesale credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client or counterparty investment  Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio held predominantly by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives or from principal investments managed in various lines of business and Corporate in predominantly privately-held financial instruments  Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity Market prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term  Operational risk is the risk associated with inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events and includes compliance risk, conduct risk, legal risk, and estimations and model risk  Compliance risk is the risk of failure to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the business activities of the Firm Operational  Conduct risk is the risk that any action or inaction by an employee or employees could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s reputation  Legal risk is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm  Estimations and model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs 8 For additional information on the Firm's risks, see Enterprise-Wide Risk Management and the various risk sections on pages 79-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 1 Reputational impact is less quantifiable than other risks. Actual losses from historical events that may have impacted the Firm’s reputation are captured through the Firm’s operational loss forecasting framework; however, the entirety of the reputational impact may not be quantifiable Key methodologies used in capital adequacy assessment projections Capital component Forecast methodology PPNR  Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense; includes operational risk expense and excludes credit cost  Product-centric models and forecasting frameworks for revenue forecasts are based on JPMorgan Chase’s historical experience supplemented by industry data and non-model estimation, where appropriate  Granular, LOB-level projections are used for expense forecasts, governed by Firmwide expense reduction guidelines for severe stress environments  Econometric and regression models and forecasting framework are used, as appropriate, to establish relationships between macroeconomic factors and the Firm’s historical experience  Operational risk loss projections utilize multiple approaches. For risks with relatively more frequent losses, the relationship between macroeconomic variables and the Firm’s historical loss experience for those risks are utilized to derive loss projections. For idiosyncratic risks with relatively large potential losses, the loss projections rely on subject matter experts' forward-looking assessment of the risk (i.e., scenario analysis, reasonably possible Capital loss) (earnings) Gains/losses on securities  Projections of gains/losses on AFS and HTM positions resulting from credit-related OTTI; assumes no securities are sold throughout the forecast period  OTTI is estimated using credit migration models for non-securitized assets and cash flow simulations for securitized assets Losses on HFS/FVO loans  Projections reflect changes in valuations of HFS loans and commitments pending syndication, as well as loans accounted for under FVO in the Firm’s wholesale loan portfolio  Projections capture the Firm’s exposure to changes in the mark-to-market value of HFS/FVO loans primarily due to credit spreads based on facility rating Provision for loan and lease losses  Projections of net charge-offs, reserves, and loan balances are based on the composition and characteristics of wholesale and consumer loan portfolios across asset classes and customer segments Credit  Model-based approach reflects credit migrations and changes in delinquency trends driven by underlying economic factors; additionally, models consider characteristics such as credit rating, geographic distribution, product and industry mix, and collateral type  Utilizes loss experience data relevant to the Firm’s asset classes and portfolios 9 Key methodologies used in capital adequacy assessment projections (cont’d) Capital component Forecast methodology Trading & counterparty losses  Instantaneous global market shocks with no mitigating actions were applied to trading and counterparty positions as of November 8, 20181; mark-to- market and nine-quarter default losses are reflected in the first quarter of the projection period  Market Utilizes the existing Firmwide stress framework and models approved for valuation and stress testing to measure the Firm’s exposure to changes in the fair value of financial instruments primarily driven by movements in interest rates, FX rates, equity prices, credit spreads, and commodity prices  Counterparty default assumes an instantaneous and unexpected default of the counterparty which would result in the largest loss across derivatives and securities financing transaction activities after the market shock. In addition, modelled losses related to other traded products and central counterparty clearing exposures are also included  Projections of risk-weighted assets are calculated under the Basel III Standardized capital risk-based approach RWA  Credit risk RWA projections utilize forecasted loan, securities, derivatives and secured financing balances  Market risk RWA projections reflect relationships between RWA and key macroeconomic drivers using estimation models  AOCI primarily includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans AOCI  Projections are based on estimated changes in value of positions using a combination of full revaluation and sensitivity-based forecasting approaches for AFS securities, and pension and OPEB plan assets and liabilities  Capital projections reflect: Capital  Balance sheet management strategies  DFAST Capital Actions prescribed by the Federal Reserve's requirements 1 As prescribed in the 2019 CCAR Instructions, the “as-of” date can be any date during the business week of November 5, 2018 10 Table of contents Page 1 2019 Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario results 1 2 Risks and methodologies 8 3 DFAST results – In-scope bank entity 11 4 Forward-looking statements 13 DFAST results under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario Capital projections – JPMCB JPMCB-calculated projected stressed capital ratios¹ (1Q19 – 1Q21) Stressed capital ratios2 Actual 4Q18 1Q21 Minimum Common equity tier 1 capital ratio (%) 13.9% 13.5% 12.4% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (%) 13.9% 13.5% 12.4% Total risk-based capital ratio (%) 14.7% 14.7% 13.4% Tier 1 leverage ratio (%) 8.6% 7.7% 7.6% Supplementary leverage ratio (%) 6.7% 6.2% 6.0% 1 All regulatory capital ratios (except the supplementary leverage ratio (""SLR"")) were calculated under the Basel III Standardized rules on a transitional basis (4Q18 only) or a fully phased-in basis (1Q19-1Q21). The SLR was calculated on a fully phased-in basis under the Basel III Advanced rules for all periods. For additional information on Basel III, refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-94 and Note 26 on pages 269-270 of JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 2 Changes in capital ratios over the projection horizon are primarily driven by PPNR, provisions for loan and lease losses, trading and counterparty losses, AOCI, changes in RWA, and capital distributions to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Stressed capital ratios are calculated in accordance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's Annual Stress Test rule requirements (12 CFR Part 46). See 77 Fed.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) in accordance with Subpart F of Regulation YY, issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), which implemented the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (“DFAST”) requirements for covered companies1. The results reflect certain forecasted financial measures for the nine-quarter projection period (1Q19 through 1Q21) under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve. The stress test has been conducted in accordance with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) 2019 Summary Instructions published by the Federal Reserve on March 6, 2019 (“2019 CCAR Instructions”). The results presented were calculated using forecasting models and methodologies developed by JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve conducts its own stress tests of covered companies, including JPMorgan Chase, based on forecasting models and methodologies developed by the Federal Reserve. Because of the different models and methodologies utilized by the Firm and the Federal Reserve, the results published by the Federal Reserve may vary from those disclosed herein. JPMorgan Chase may not be able to explain the differences between the results published in this report and the results published by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase's results presented herein reflect the following specific assumptions as prescribed by the DFAST rule for each of the second through ninth quarters of the projection period (“DFAST Capital Actions”)2:  Common stock dividend payments continue at the same dollar amount as the average of the prior-four quarters (2Q18 – 1Q19) and include common stock dividends attributable to issuances related to employee compensation  Scheduled dividend, interest, or principal payments for other capital instruments are paid  Repurchases of common stock and redemptions of other capital instruments are zero  Issuances of new preferred, or common stock, other than issuances of common stock related to employee compensation, are zero The results disclosed herein represent hypothetical estimates under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve and do not represent JPMorgan Chase's forecasts of actual expected gains, losses, pre-provision net revenue (""PPNR""), net income before taxes, capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), or capital ratios. A strong capital position is essential to JPMorgan Chase's business strategy and competitive position. Capital adequacy and stress testing is subject to oversight at the most senior levels of the Firm, including the Board of Directors. The Annual and Mid-Cycle DFAST stress tests are subject to a governance framework, which includes oversight by: the Board of Directors, the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee, the Capital Governance Committee, Capital & Liquidity Management, the Firmwide and line of business (“LOB”) Chief Financial Officers and Chief Risk Officers, Model Risk Governance & Review, and Internal Audit. 1 JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Stress Test Disclosure also presents results of the annual stress test conducted with respect to the Firm’s principal depository institution subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMCB”), in accordance with the DFAST regulation issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In the previous year, the Annual Stress Test Disclosure included results for two depository institutions: JPMCB and Chase Bank USA, National Association (“CUSA”). In May 2019, CUSA was merged with and into JPMCB with JPMCB as the surviving bank. The JPMCB results reflect its forecasts prior to the merger from JPMCB’s actual balance sheet and income statement from 4Q18, and do not consider the impact of the merger. CUSA results are no longer separately disclosed. 2 The first quarter of the projection period (1Q19) reflects actual capital actions (e.g., actual common stock dividends and repurchases net of issuances, and issuances and redemptions of other capital instruments) 1 2019 DFAST annual Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario summary  The Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario, as constructed and prescribed by the Federal Reserve, is characterized by a severe global recession accompanied by a period of heightened stress in commercial real estate markets and corporate debt markets Key economic variables from Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario prescribed by the Federal Reserve¹  U.S. real GDP – GDP declines 8.0% between the fourth quarter of 2018 and its trough in the third quarter of 2020  U.S. inflation – The annualized rate of change in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) drops from 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 1.2% in the first quarter of 2019  U.S. unemployment rate – Unemployment rate increases by 6.2 percentage points from its level in the fourth quarter of 2018, peaking at 10% in the third quarter of 2020  Real estate prices – House prices decline 26% through the first quarter of 2021 relative to their level in the fourth quarter of 2018; commercial real estate prices decline by 35% through the first quarter of 2021 relative to their level in the fourth quarter of 2018  Equity markets – Equity prices decline by 50% between the fourth quarter of 2018 and their trough in the fourth quarter of 2019; equity market volatility peaks in the second quarter of 2019  Short-term and long-term rates – Short-term Treasury rates drop from 2.30% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 0.10% in the third quarter of 2019, where they remain for the duration of the forecast horizon; long-term Treasury rates drop from 3.00% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 0.80% in the first quarter of 2019, gradually recovering to 1.50% by the first quarter of 2021  Mortgage rates – 30-year mortgage rates fall from 4.80% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 3.90% in the first quarter of 2019.

The results of the Firm's capital stress tests reflect risks from each of these categories: Risk types Definition  Strategic risk is the risk associated with the Firm’s current and future business plans and objectives, including capital risk, liquidity risk, and the impact to the Firm’s reputation¹  Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level and composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks Strategic during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions  Liquidity risk is risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition, and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities  Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk  Consumer credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a customer Credit and  Wholesale credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client or counterparty investment  Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio held predominantly by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives or from principal investments managed in various lines of business and Corporate in predominantly privately-held financial instruments  Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity Market prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term  Operational risk is the risk associated with inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events and includes compliance risk, conduct risk, legal risk, and estimations and model risk  Compliance risk is the risk of failure to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the business activities of the Firm Operational  Conduct risk is the risk that any action or inaction by an employee or employees could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s reputation  Legal risk is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm  Estimations and model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs 8 For additional information on the Firm's risks, see Enterprise-Wide Risk Management and the various risk sections on pages 79-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 1 Reputational impact is less quantifiable than other risks. Actual losses from historical events that may have impacted the Firm’s reputation are captured through the Firm’s operational loss forecasting framework; however, the entirety of the reputational impact may not be quantifiable Key methodologies used in capital adequacy assessment projections Capital component Forecast methodology PPNR  Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense; includes operational risk expense and excludes credit cost  Product-centric models and forecasting frameworks for revenue forecasts are based on JPMorgan Chase’s historical experience supplemented by industry data and non-model estimation, where appropriate  Granular, LOB-level projections are used for expense forecasts, governed by Firmwide expense reduction guidelines for severe stress environments  Econometric and regression models and forecasting framework are used, as appropriate, to establish relationships between macroeconomic factors and the Firm’s historical experience  Operational risk loss projections utilize multiple approaches. For risks with relatively more frequent losses, the relationship between macroeconomic variables and the Firm’s historical loss experience for those risks are utilized to derive loss projections. For idiosyncratic risks with relatively large potential losses, the loss projections rely on subject matter experts' forward-looking assessment of the risk (i.e., scenario analysis, reasonably possible Capital loss) (earnings) Gains/losses on securities  Projections of gains/losses on AFS and HTM positions resulting from credit-related OTTI; assumes no securities are sold throughout the forecast period  OTTI is estimated using credit migration models for non-securitized assets and cash flow simulations for securitized assets Losses on HFS/FVO loans  Projections reflect changes in valuations of HFS loans and commitments pending syndication, as well as loans accounted for under FVO in the Firm’s wholesale loan portfolio  Projections capture the Firm’s exposure to changes in the mark-to-market value of HFS/FVO loans primarily due to credit spreads based on facility rating Provision for loan and lease losses  Projections of net charge-offs, reserves, and loan balances are based on the composition and characteristics of wholesale and consumer loan portfolios across asset classes and customer segments Credit  Model-based approach reflects credit migrations and changes in delinquency trends driven by underlying economic factors; additionally, models consider characteristics such as credit rating, geographic distribution, product and industry mix, and collateral type  Utilizes loss experience data relevant to the Firm’s asset classes and portfolios 9 Key methodologies used in capital adequacy assessment projections (cont’d) Capital component Forecast methodology Trading & counterparty losses  Instantaneous global market shocks with no mitigating actions were applied to trading and counterparty positions as of November 8, 20181; mark-to- market and nine-quarter default losses are reflected in the first quarter of the projection period  Market Utilizes the existing Firmwide stress framework and models approved for valuation and stress testing to measure the Firm’s exposure to changes in the fair value of financial instruments primarily driven by movements in interest rates, FX rates, equity prices, credit spreads, and commodity prices  Counterparty default assumes an instantaneous and unexpected default of the counterparty which would result in the largest loss across derivatives and securities financing transaction activities after the market shock. In addition, modelled losses related to other traded products and central counterparty clearing exposures are also included  Projections of risk-weighted assets are calculated under the Basel III Standardized capital risk-based approach RWA  Credit risk RWA projections utilize forecasted loan, securities, derivatives and secured financing balances  Market risk RWA projections reflect relationships between RWA and key macroeconomic drivers using estimation models  AOCI primarily includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities and the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans AOCI  Projections are based on estimated changes in value of positions using a combination of full revaluation and sensitivity-based forecasting approaches for AFS securities, and pension and OPEB plan assets and liabilities  Capital projections reflect: Capital  Balance sheet management strategies  DFAST Capital Actions prescribed by the Federal Reserve's requirements 1 As prescribed in the 2019 CCAR Instructions, the “as-of” date can be any date during the business week of November 5, 2018 10 Table of contents Page 1 2019 Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario results 1 2 Risks and methodologies 8 3 DFAST results – In-scope bank entity 11 4 Forward-looking statements 13 DFAST results under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario Capital projections – JPMCB JPMCB-calculated projected stressed capital ratios¹ (1Q19 – 1Q21) Stressed capital ratios2 Actual 4Q18 1Q21 Minimum Common equity tier 1 capital ratio (%) 13.9% 13.5% 12.4% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (%) 13.9% 13.5% 12.4% Total risk-based capital ratio (%) 14.7% 14.7% 13.4% Tier 1 leverage ratio (%) 8.6% 7.7% 7.6% Supplementary leverage ratio (%) 6.7% 6.2% 6.0% 1 All regulatory capital ratios (except the supplementary leverage ratio (""SLR"")) were calculated under the Basel III Standardized rules on a transitional basis (4Q18 only) or a fully phased-in basis (1Q19-1Q21). The SLR was calculated on a fully phased-in basis under the Basel III Advanced rules for all periods. For additional information on Basel III, refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-94 and Note 26 on pages 269-270 of JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 2 Changes in capital ratios over the projection horizon are primarily driven by PPNR, provisions for loan and lease losses, trading and counterparty losses, AOCI, changes in RWA, and capital distributions to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Stressed capital ratios are calculated in accordance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's Annual Stress Test rule requirements (12 CFR Part 46). See 77 Fed. Reg. 61238 (December 3, 2014). The stressed capital ratios reflect certain capital actions JPMCB would expect to take if the stress scenario was realized and consistent with JPMCB’s internal capital management policy. The minimum capital ratio represents the lowest calculated stressed capital ratio during the period 1Q19 to 1Q21 11 DFAST results under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario Profit & Loss projections – JPMCB JPMCB-calculated 9-quarter cumulative projected losses, revenue, net income before taxes, and other comprehensive income (1Q19 – 1Q21) Billions of Percent of dollars average assets1 Pre-provision net revenue2 $56.6 2.5% equals Net interest income 90.7 3.9 Noninterest income 93.0 4.0 less Noninterest expense 127.1 5.5 Other revenue3 0.0 less Provisions 30.1 Realized losses/(gains) on securities (AFS/HTM)4 0.2 Trading and counterparty losses5 14.6 Other losses/(gains)6 4.7 equals Net income (loss) before taxes $6.9 0.3% Memo items Other comprehensive income7 $(3.1) Other effects on capital Actual 4Q18 1Q21 Accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") in capital $(1.6) $(4.3) (billions of dollars) Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding 1 Average assets is the nine-quarter average of total assets for 1Q19 to 1Q21 2 PPNR includes losses from operational-risk events, mortgage repurchase expenses, and OREO costs 3 Other revenue includes one-time income and expense items not included in PPNR 4 Realized losses/(gains) on AFS and HTM securities consist of projections resulting from credit-related OTTI.
