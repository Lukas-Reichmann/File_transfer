CLEANSPARK, INC. Date: January 8, 2024 By: /s/ Gary Vecchiarelli Name: Gary Vecchiarelli Title: Chief Financial Officer -;-EX-99.1: CleanSpark Announces Strategic Agreement for up to 160,000 Bitmain S21 Miners, Path to 50 EH/s Initial batch of 12 EH/s, or 60,000 units, expected to ship next quarter Agreement includes strategic call option to purchase 100,000 S21s at a fixed price of $16 per terahash Company is positioned to expand into the next bull market, while continuing to secure ASICs at fixed prices well into the next cycle LAS VEGAS, January 8, 2024 -- CleanSpark Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America's Bitcoin Miner, today announced the purchase of up to 160,000 Bitmain S21 miners, or the equivalent of 32 exahashes per second (EH/s). Under the terms of the agreement, CleanSpark, one of the largest and most efficient publicly traded bitcoin mining companies in North America, has purchased 60,000 units with delivery expected April through June 2024. The agreement also includes a strategic call option to purchase an additional 100,000 machines at a fixed price of $16.00 per terahash until the end of the calendar year. If the full call option is exercised, CleanSpark’s hashrate is expected to increase to approximately 50 EH/s, a 400% increase from its current hashrate of 10 EH/s, once all machines are deployed. “This strategic agreement enhances our operational efficiency, provides massive optionality, and positions us to maximize opportunities that we expect on the horizon,” said CEO Zachary Bradford. “We are ready to expand into the next bull market without the need to worry about an increase in machine prices, since the call purchase option acts as a hedge to this risk.” “For example,” Bradford continued, ""in the last bull market, machine prices increased by three to five times, and we expect the same to occur in future bull markets. This agreement allows us to manage our capital most efficiently by controlling as many variables as possible. It also provides us the flexibility to time our infrastructure growth with macro events, while providing certainty of cost on the miners.” CleanSpark opted for Bitmain’s S21 model over their T21 model or other manufacturers’ units because of the S21’s commanding performance. The S21 is the most efficient bitcoin mining machine on the market. “After receiving initial units, and performing real world testing, we have determined that the S21 is more efficient and better suited for our operations,” Bradford said. “Being best-in-class is the CleanSpark way and we expect this agreement to keep us positioned as one of the most energy efficient and highest uptime miners in the industry. As we continue to expand our capacity, we are not only confident that we will successfully navigate the halving, but we also believe that we will unlock new avenues of growth, further solidifying our position as a top publicly traded bitcoin miner.” The purchase price for the first 60,000 units is $16.10 per terahash, for a total of $193.2 million, after discounts and coupons. An additional 100,000 units can be purchased by the company at a fixed price of $16.00 per terahash. About CleanSpark CleanSpark (Nasdaq: CLSK) is America's Bitcoin Miner.

Physical gold is only divisible into small pieces; Bitcoin is divisible to eight decimals. Gold and bitcoin are fungible, but fiat currency is not fungible with other fiat (US Dollar is not fungible with the Canadian Dollar). Gold has a high value-to-weight ratio, but it is still heavy and cumbersome to transport compared to the others. Both gold and fiat currency have been counterfeited; Gold can be verified but only through cumbersome assay.

Copyright 2023 CleanSpark | Facility: College Park CleanSpark's first ever bitcoin mining facility is in College Park, Georgia. It sits on six acres near the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and features at its heart 48 new generation air-cooled pods enclosed by a Department of Transportation sound wall. Machines are also housed in 20 Ant boxes, an annex building and within the original data center. CleanSpark founder and CEO Zach Bradford originally visited the operation to consult on an energy project but quickly recognized the opportunity to lead one of the most important energy projects of our generation: bitcoin mining.

Copyright 2023 CleanSpark | Facility: Norcross An 87,000-square-foot data center in Norcross was purchased and transformed into CleanSpark's second Bitcoin mining facility. Situated on over seven acres, the immersion-cooled site participates in Georgia’s Flex REC program and is 100% net carbon-neutral. There are two large rooms that house 20 MW of single-phase immersion — about 4,300 machines. Liquid immersion cooling, where the bitcoin mining machines are fully immersed in a specialized oil, has proven to significantly improve efficiency by reducing power consumption and extending the life of the machines — thereby maximizing financial gains.

Copyright 2023 CleanSpark | Facility: Washington Nestled between Augusta and Athens, the historic town of Washington is home to CleanSpark’s third bitcoin mining facility. It was purchased during the summer 2022 bear market from another bitcoin miner as an already-operational site. Bitcoin mining machines operate in multiple air-cooled buildings. A completed 50MW expansion created four more buildings filled with an additional 14,000 latest-gen miners. It draws power predominantly from low-carbon sources, such as nuclear energy. Since its acquisition, CleanSpark has contributed hundreds of thousands in taxes to the city and supported numerous local businesses through sponsorships and charities. It is a perfect place to mine bitcoin, and we are thrilled to partner with the community.

The turnkey operation in Sandersville was acquired from another bitcoin miner with room to almost triple its capacity. The site is undergoing a massive 150 MW expansion with expected completion later this year. It will feature cathedral-style buildings, some the length of over three football fields. Each building will house thousands of high-performance bitcoin mining machines and, once completed, will add about 7 EH/s to CleanSpark’s hashrate.

Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, CleanSpark management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Our management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. We are providing supplemental financial measures for non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, certain non-recurring expenses, and impacts related to discontinued operations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) significant non-cash expenses such as our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) significant impairment losses related to long-lived and digital assets, which include our bitcoin for which the accounting requires significant estimates and judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; and (iv) and impacts related to discontinued operations that would not be applicable to our future business activities. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. We have also excluded impairment losses on assets, including impairments of our digital currency our non-GAAP financial measures, which may continue to occur in future periods as a result of our continued holdings of significant amounts of bitcoin. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. 37 NASDAQ: CLSK All Rights Reserved.

Copyright 2023 CleanSpark | Facility: College Park CleanSpark's first ever bitcoin mining facility is in College Park, Georgia. It sits on six acres near the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and features at its heart 48 new generation air-cooled pods enclosed by a Department of Transportation sound wall. Machines are also housed in 20 Ant boxes, an annex building and within the original data center. CleanSpark founder and CEO Zach Bradford originally visited the operation to consult on an energy project but quickly recognized the opportunity to lead one of the most important energy projects of our generation: bitcoin mining.

Copyright 2023 CleanSpark | Facility: Norcross An 87,000-square-foot data center in Norcross was purchased and transformed into CleanSpark's second Bitcoin mining facility. Situated on over seven acres, the immersion-cooled site participates in Georgia’s Flex REC program and is 100% net carbon-neutral. There are two large rooms that house 20 MW of single-phase immersion — about 4,300 machines. Liquid immersion cooling, where the bitcoin mining machines are fully immersed in a specialized oil, has proven to significantly improve efficiency by reducing power consumption and extending the life of the machines — thereby maximizing financial gains.

Copyright 2023 CleanSpark | Facility: Washington Nestled between Augusta and Athens, the historic town of Washington is home to CleanSpark’s third bitcoin mining facility. It was purchased during the summer 2022 bear market from another bitcoin miner as an already-operational site. Bitcoin mining machines operate in multiple air-cooled buildings. A completed 50MW expansion created four more buildings filled with an additional 14,000 latest-gen miners. It draws power predominantly from low-carbon sources, such as nuclear energy. Since its acquisition, CleanSpark has contributed hundreds of thousands in taxes to the city and supported numerous local businesses through sponsorships and charities. It is a perfect place to mine bitcoin, and we are thrilled to partner with the community.

The turnkey operation in Sandersville was acquired from another bitcoin miner with room to almost triple its capacity. The site is undergoing a massive 150 MW expansion with expected completion later this year. It will feature cathedral-style buildings, some the length of over three football fields. Each building will house thousands of high-performance bitcoin mining machines and, once completed, will add about 7 EH/s to CleanSpark’s hashrate.

Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, CleanSpark management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Our management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. We are providing supplemental financial measures for non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, certain non-recurring expenses, and impacts related to discontinued operations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) significant non-cash expenses such as our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) significant impairment losses related to long-lived and digital assets, which include our bitcoin for which the accounting requires significant estimates and judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; and (iv) and impacts related to discontinued operations that would not be applicable to our future business activities. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. We have also excluded impairment losses on assets, including impairments of our digital currency our non-GAAP financial measures, which may continue to occur in future periods as a result of our continued holdings of significant amounts of bitcoin. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The proposed acquisition is transformational for both companies and provides immediate scale, diversity and profitability to AbbVie’s growth platform; enhances long-term R&D investment and sustained focus on innovative science; and increases global commercial scale to further maximize the value of Allergan’s portfolio. The combined company will produce robust cash flow to support continued dividend growth and reduction of debt levels. Additional information on the transaction can be found at www.abbvie.com/abbvie-allergan.html • AbbVie announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission (EC) approvals of SKYRIZI (risankizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. The approvals are based on results from four pivotal Phase 3 studies, ultIMMa-1, ultIMMa-2, IMMvent and IMMhance evaluating more than 2,000 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. SKYRIZI is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally. • At the World Congress of Dermatology, AbbVie presented new two-year data showing SKYRIZI patients with moderate to severe psoriasis maintained complete skin clearance. Longer-term results from the Phase 3 IMMhance study showed 73 percent and 72 percent of patients treated with continuous SKYRIZI experienced complete skin clearance (defined as static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) 0 and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 100, respectively) at week 94, among patients who achieved a sPGA 0/1 at week 28. No new safety findings were observed at two years. • At the European Congress of Rheumatology, AbbVie presented new long-term data from upadacitinib Phase 3 studies SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE showing a significantly higher proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with upadacitinib monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) maintained clinical remission compared with MTX or adalimumab plus MTX, respectively, at 48 weeks. Additionally, findings from an integrated safety analysis across five studies in the SELECT Phase 3 clinical program support the well-characterized safety profile of upadacitinib in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. • AbbVie announced FDA approval for VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) in combination with obinutuzumab as a chemotherapy-free combination regimen for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients. The FDA reviewed the submission under the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program and approval was based on data from the Phase 3 CLL14 trial evaluating VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab compared to patients who received chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab. This is the fourth approval and the fifth Breakthrough Therapy designation for VENCLEXTA. Venetoclax is being developed by AbbVie and Roche and is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. • At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress, AbbVie presented over forty abstracts including results from the Phase 3 CLL14 trial of VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab in previously untreated CLL patients, results from the Phase 3 BELLINI trial of VENCLEXTA plus bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) multiple myeloma (MM) and results from the Phase 3 CLL12 trial of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in the asymptomatic watch and wait population of CLL. AbbVie also presented new IMBRUVICA six-year and five-year data from the Phase 3 RESONATE and RESONATE-2 trials, respectively, evaluating its long-term safety and efficacy benefit in CLL/SLL patients. IMBRUVICA is jointly developed and commercialized with Janssen Biotech, Inc. 3 Recent Events (continued) • AbbVie announced the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold placed on CANOVA, a Phase 3 trial evaluating VENCLEXTA for the investigational treatment of r/r MM. The CANOVA trial evaluates VENCLEXTA in combination with dexamethasone versus pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in patients with r/r MM positive for the translocation (11;14) abnormality. The partial clinical hold removal is based upon agreement on revisions to the CANOVA study protocol, including new risk mitigation measures, protocol-specified guidelines and updated futility criteria. The t(11;14) genetic biomarker is among the most common and routinely tested genetic abnormalities in patients with MM. • AbbVie provided an update on the depatuxizumab mafodotin (Depatux-M) glioblastoma program, announcing that the Phase 3 INTELLANCE-1 study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival at the interim analysis and demonstrated no survival benefit for newly diagnosed patients receiving Depatux-M. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee responsible for interim analysis data review recommended stopping the study due to lack of survival benefit for patients receiving Depatux-M and enrollment in all ongoing Depatux-M studies has been halted. Results will be submitted for presentation at a medical conference and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. • At the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, AbbVie presented six abstracts, including two oral presentations showing AbbVie’s research progress in difficult to treat neurological conditions. Investigators presented pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability data on ABBV-951, a levodopa/carbidopa prodrug, delivering a 24-hour continuous, subcutaneous infusion under investigation for the treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. Investigators also presented data from a Phase 1, multiple-dose study of elezanumab in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. • AbbVie announced that it has resolved U.S. HUMIRA (adalimumab) litigation with BI. Under the terms of the resolution, AbbVie will grant BI a non-exclusive license to its HUMIRA-related intellectual property in the United States. The U.S. license for BI will begin on July 1, 2023. BI will pay royalties to AbbVie for licensing its HUMIRA patents and acknowledges the validity and enforceability of the licensed patents. AbbVie will make no payments of any form to BI. • AbbVie announced the acquisition of Mavupharma, a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on novel approaches to target the STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) pathway for the treatment of cancer. STING pathway signaling plays an important role in the generation of an immune response directed at tumors, and enhancing STING signaling has shown promise in a variety of tumor models. STING pathway stimulation has the potential to increase the susceptibility of tumors and broaden treatment options for patients. The collaboration broadens AbbVie's oncology research platform to expand the development of potentially life-changing treatments for patients. Full-Year 2019 Outlook AbbVie is updating its GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the full-year 2019 from $7.26 to $7.36 to $5.69 to $5.79, representing growth of 56.8 percent at the midpoint, inclusive of a non-cash charge for SKYRIZI contingent consideration following regulatory approvals in the second quarter. AbbVie is raising its previously announced adjusted EPS guidance range for the full-year 2019 from $8.73 to $8.83 to $8.82 to $8.92, representing growth of 12.1 percent at the midpoint. The company's 2019 adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes $3.13 per share of intangible asset amortization expense, non-cash charges for contingent consideration adjustments and other specified items. 4 Statements Required by the Irish Takeover Rules The earnings guidance contained in this press release constitutes a profit forecast for the purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules.

The proposed acquisition is transformational for both companies and provides immediate scale, diversity and profitability to AbbVie’s growth platform; enhances long-term R&D investment and sustained focus on innovative science; and increases global commercial scale to further maximize the value of Allergan’s portfolio. The combined company will produce robust cash flow to support continued dividend growth and reduction of debt levels. Additional information on the transaction can be found at www.abbvie.com/abbvie-allergan.html • AbbVie announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission (EC) approvals of SKYRIZI (risankizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. The approvals are based on results from four pivotal Phase 3 studies, ultIMMa-1, ultIMMa-2, IMMvent and IMMhance evaluating more than 2,000 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. SKYRIZI is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally. • At the World Congress of Dermatology, AbbVie presented new two-year data showing SKYRIZI patients with moderate to severe psoriasis maintained complete skin clearance. Longer-term results from the Phase 3 IMMhance study showed 73 percent and 72 percent of patients treated with continuous SKYRIZI experienced complete skin clearance (defined as static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) 0 and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 100, respectively) at week 94, among patients who achieved a sPGA 0/1 at week 28. No new safety findings were observed at two years. • At the European Congress of Rheumatology, AbbVie presented new long-term data from upadacitinib Phase 3 studies SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE showing a significantly higher proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with upadacitinib monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) maintained clinical remission compared with MTX or adalimumab plus MTX, respectively, at 48 weeks. Additionally, findings from an integrated safety analysis across five studies in the SELECT Phase 3 clinical program support the well-characterized safety profile of upadacitinib in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. • AbbVie announced FDA approval for VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) in combination with obinutuzumab as a chemotherapy-free combination regimen for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients. The FDA reviewed the submission under the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program and approval was based on data from the Phase 3 CLL14 trial evaluating VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab compared to patients who received chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab. This is the fourth approval and the fifth Breakthrough Therapy designation for VENCLEXTA. Venetoclax is being developed by AbbVie and Roche and is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S. • At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress, AbbVie presented over forty abstracts including results from the Phase 3 CLL14 trial of VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab in previously untreated CLL patients, results from the Phase 3 BELLINI trial of VENCLEXTA plus bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) multiple myeloma (MM) and results from the Phase 3 CLL12 trial of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in the asymptomatic watch and wait population of CLL. AbbVie also presented new IMBRUVICA six-year and five-year data from the Phase 3 RESONATE and RESONATE-2 trials, respectively, evaluating its long-term safety and efficacy benefit in CLL/SLL patients. IMBRUVICA is jointly developed and commercialized with Janssen Biotech, Inc. 3 Recent Events (continued) • AbbVie announced the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold placed on CANOVA, a Phase 3 trial evaluating VENCLEXTA for the investigational treatment of r/r MM. The CANOVA trial evaluates VENCLEXTA in combination with dexamethasone versus pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in patients with r/r MM positive for the translocation (11;14) abnormality. The partial clinical hold removal is based upon agreement on revisions to the CANOVA study protocol, including new risk mitigation measures, protocol-specified guidelines and updated futility criteria. The t(11;14) genetic biomarker is among the most common and routinely tested genetic abnormalities in patients with MM. • AbbVie provided an update on the depatuxizumab mafodotin (Depatux-M) glioblastoma program, announcing that the Phase 3 INTELLANCE-1 study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival at the interim analysis and demonstrated no survival benefit for newly diagnosed patients receiving Depatux-M. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee responsible for interim analysis data review recommended stopping the study due to lack of survival benefit for patients receiving Depatux-M and enrollment in all ongoing Depatux-M studies has been halted. Results will be submitted for presentation at a medical conference and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. • At the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, AbbVie presented six abstracts, including two oral presentations showing AbbVie’s research progress in difficult to treat neurological conditions. Investigators presented pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability data on ABBV-951, a levodopa/carbidopa prodrug, delivering a 24-hour continuous, subcutaneous infusion under investigation for the treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. Investigators also presented data from a Phase 1, multiple-dose study of elezanumab in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. • AbbVie announced that it has resolved U.S. HUMIRA (adalimumab) litigation with BI. Under the terms of the resolution, AbbVie will grant BI a non-exclusive license to its HUMIRA-related intellectual property in the United States. The U.S. license for BI will begin on July 1, 2023. BI will pay royalties to AbbVie for licensing its HUMIRA patents and acknowledges the validity and enforceability of the licensed patents. AbbVie will make no payments of any form to BI. • AbbVie announced the acquisition of Mavupharma, a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on novel approaches to target the STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) pathway for the treatment of cancer. STING pathway signaling plays an important role in the generation of an immune response directed at tumors, and enhancing STING signaling has shown promise in a variety of tumor models. STING pathway stimulation has the potential to increase the susceptibility of tumors and broaden treatment options for patients. The collaboration broadens AbbVie's oncology research platform to expand the development of potentially life-changing treatments for patients. Full-Year 2019 Outlook AbbVie is updating its GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the full-year 2019 from $7.26 to $7.36 to $5.69 to $5.79, representing growth of 56.8 percent at the midpoint, inclusive of a non-cash charge for SKYRIZI contingent consideration following regulatory approvals in the second quarter. AbbVie is raising its previously announced adjusted EPS guidance range for the full-year 2019 from $8.73 to $8.83 to $8.82 to $8.92, representing growth of 12.1 percent at the midpoint. The company's 2019 adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes $3.13 per share of intangible asset amortization expense, non-cash charges for contingent consideration adjustments and other specified items. 4 Statements Required by the Irish Takeover Rules The earnings guidance contained in this press release constitutes a profit forecast for the purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation (AbbVie), issued an announcement (the Rule 2.5 Announcement) pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the Irish Takeover Rules disclosing that the boards of directors of AbbVie and Allergan plc, an Irish public limited company (Allergan), had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition of Allergan by AbbVie (the Acquisition). In connection with the Acquisition, (i) AbbVie, Allergan and Venice Subsidiary LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie (Acquirer Sub), entered into a Transaction Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2019 (the Transaction Agreement), (ii) AbbVie and Allergan entered into an Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2019 (the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement), and (iii) AbbVie, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (Morgan Stanley), as administrative agent, and certain other parties entered into a 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2019 (the Bridge Credit Agreement). Rule 2.5 Announcement On June 25, 2019, AbbVie issued the Rule 2.5 Announcement disclosing that the boards of directors of AbbVie and Allergan had reached agreement on the terms of the Acquisition. The Acquisition will be effected by means of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement (the Scheme) under Irish law pursuant to which Acquirer Sub will acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Allergan (Allergan Shares) in exchange for 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock (AbbVie Shares) and $120.30 in cash (and any cash in lieu of fractions of AbbVie Shares due to a holder of Allergan Shares) per Allergan Share, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Exchange Ratio Modification Number (as defined in the Transaction Agreement). The Acquisition will be conditioned upon, among other things, the approval of the Scheme by the Allergan shareholders , the sanction of the Scheme by the Irish High Court (the Court), the registration of the Court Order (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) with the Registrar of Companies in Dublin, Ireland and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The conditions to the Acquisition are set out in full in Appendix III to the Rule 2.5 Announcement (the Conditions Appendix). It is expected that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, the Acquisition will be completed in early 2020. AbbVie reserves the right, subject to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, to elect to implement the Acquisition by way of a takeover offer (as such term is defined in the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997 and Takeover Rules, 2013). Transaction Agreement On June 25, 2019, AbbVie, Allergan and Acquirer Sub entered into the Transaction Agreement in connection with the proposed Acquisition. The Transaction Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by AbbVie and Allergan. AbbVie and Allergan have agreed, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, that Allergan may not, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or take any action or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any offer or alternative proposal for specified alternative transactions or any indication, proposal or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to such an offer or proposal, (b) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding such an offer or proposal with, or furnish any information relating to Allergan or any of its subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort by, any person that would reasonably be expected to seek to make, or has made, such an offer or proposal or (c) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other agreement providing for or relating to such an offer or proposal. In addition, certain covenants require each of the parties to use, subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, their reasonable best efforts to cause the Acquisition to be consummated. Subject to certain exceptions, the Transaction Agreement also requires Allergan to hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders and requires the board of directors of Allergan to recommend approval of the Acquisition. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, upon completion of the Acquisition, two members of Allergans board of directors will join AbbVies board of directors. 2 The Transaction Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. The Transaction Agreement also contains certain customary termination rights, including, among others and subject to certain conditions, the right of either party to terminate if (a) the Scheme has not become effective by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 25, 2020, which period will be extended to September 25, 2020 in certain circumstances, (b) the requisite Allergan shareholder approvals are not obtained, (c) the other party breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements or any of the other partys representations or warranties are inaccurate and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy would result in certain of the closing conditions not being satisfied, subject to a cure period, (d) there is any final and non-appealable order, writ, decree, judgement or injunction by any court or other tribunal or any law (other than any antitrust law in a jurisdiction in which no antitrust clearance is required) that permanently restrains, enjoins, makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Acquisition or (e) the Court declines or refuses to sanction the Scheme, unless both parties agree in writing to appeal the decision. Allergan also has the right, prior to the receipt of the requisite Allergan shareholder approvals, to terminate the Transaction Agreement to accept an Allergan Superior Proposal (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) in certain circumstances and AbbVie also has the right, prior to receipt of the requisite Allergan shareholder approvals, to terminate the Transaction Agreement if an Allergan Change of Recommendation (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) occurs. The Transaction Agreement also provides that, upon termination of the Transaction Agreement under certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain antitrust approvals, AbbVie will pay Allergan a reverse termination fee of $1.25 billion . The Transaction Agreement contains representations and warranties made by and to the parties thereto as of specific dates. The statements embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the contract between the parties and may be subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of that contract. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Expenses Reimbursement Agreement On June 25, 2019, AbbVie and Allergan entered into an Expenses Reimbursement Agreement (the ERA), the terms of which have been approved by the Irish Takeover Panel. Under the ERA, Allergan has agreed to pay to AbbVie, in certain circumstances, an amount equal to all documented, specific and quantifiable third-party costs and expenses incurred, directly or indirectly, by AbbVie and/or its subsidiaries or on their behalf, for the purposes of, in preparation for, or in connection with the Acquisition. The maximum amount payable by Allergan to AbbVie pursuant to the ERA is an amount equal to 1% of the aggregate value of the total Scheme Consideration (as defined in the ERA). Bridge Credit Facility On June 25, 2019 (the Effective Date), AbbVie entered into the Bridge Credit Agreement among AbbVie, certain lenders and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as administrative agent. The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for a $38,000,000,000 bridge credit facility (the Bridge Credit Facility). The proceeds of the Bridge Credit Facility may be used to finance the payment of the cash consideration in connection with the Acquisition, fees and expenses related thereto and to repay certain existing indebtedness of Allergan. Advances under the Bridge Credit Facility will be available on a date after the Effective Date, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Bridge Credit Agreement (the Closing Date) and will mature on the date that is 364 days after the Closing Date. Borrowings under the Bridge Credit Facility may, at AbbVies election, bear interest at either (a) the base rate plus an applicable margin (Base Rate Loans) or (b) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin (Eurocurrency Rate Loans). The applicable margin ranges from 0.0% to 1.250% per annum for Base Rate Loans and 0.750% to 2.250% per annum for Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in each case depending on the public debt rating of AbbVie then in effect. The commitments under the Bridge Credit Facility will be reduced by the net cash proceeds received by AbbVie in connection with debt and equity issuances and non-ordinary course of business asset dispositions, other than certain debt issuances and non-ordinary course asset dispositions specified in the Bridge Credit Agreement. 3 The commitments under the Bridge Credit Facility, unless previously terminated, will terminate on the earlier of (i) the date on which all of the certain funds purposes have been achieved without the making of any advances under the facility and (ii) the time after a mandatory cancellation event occurs. The Bridge Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants, including a financial covenant that will apply after the Closing Date, and events of default. The Bridge Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of AbbVie depending on the amount of indebtedness that such subsidiaries incur or guarantee, as further set forth in the Bridge Credit Agreement.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that a possible acquisition will not be pursued, failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or required financing or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the possible acquisition, adverse effects on the market price of AbbVies shares of common stock or Allergans ordinary shares and on AbbVies or Allergans operating results because of a failure to complete the possible acquisition, failure to realize the expected benefits of the possible acquisition, failure to promptly and effectively integrate Allergans businesses, negative effects relating to the announcement of the possible acquisition or any further announcements relating to the possible acquisition or the consummation of the possible acquisition on the market price of AbbVies shares of common stock or Allergans ordinary shares, significant transaction costs and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities, potential litigation associated with the possible acquisition, general economic and business conditions that affect the combined companies following the consummation of the possible acquisition, changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies, future business acquisitions or disposals and competitive developments.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future.

(NYSE: ABBV) and Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) announced that the companies have entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan in a cash and stock transaction for a transaction equity value of approximately $63 billion, based on the closing price of AbbVies common stock of $78.45 on June 24, 2019. This is a transformational transaction for both companies and achieves unique and complementary strategic objectives, said Richard A. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive officer, AbbVie. The combination of AbbVie and Allergan increases our ability to continue to deliver on our mission to patients and shareholders. With our enhanced growth platform to fuel industry-leading growth, this strategy allows us to diversify AbbVies business while sustaining our focus on innovative science and the advancement of our industry-leading pipeline well into the future. This acquisition creates compelling value for Allergans stakeholders, including our customers, patients and shareholders. With 2019 annual combined revenue of approximately $48 billion, scale in more than 175 countries, an industry-leading R&D pipeline and robust cash flows, our combined company will have the opportunity to make even bigger contributions to global health than either can alone, said Brent Saunders, chairman and chief executive officer, Allergan. Our fast-growing therapeutic areas, including our world class medical aesthetics, eye care, CNS and gastrointestinal businesses, will enhance AbbVies strong growth platform and create substantial value for shareholders of both companies. Strategic Rationale · New growth platforms and leadership positions to diversify and expand revenue base: The combined company will consist of several attractive franchises with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, medical aesthetics, neuroscience, womens health, eye care and virology. Allergans product portfolio will be enhanced by AbbVies commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. 1 · Immediate scale and enhanced profitability for AbbVies growth platform: AbbVies enhanced growth platform, comprised of growing and durable franchises across highly-attractive therapeutic areas, is expected to grow at a high-single digit annual growth rate well into the next decade, from more than $30 billion in 2020. · Financially attractive with immediate EPS accretion: This transaction is expected to be 10% accretive to adjusted earnings per share over the first full year following the close of the transaction, with peak accretion of greater than 20%. 1 ROIC is expected to exceed AbbVies cost of capital within the first full year. · Significant cash flow generation: The success and scale of the combined commercial business ensures funding capacity and flexibility for simultaneous robust pipeline investment, debt reduction and capital return to shareholders. The combined companies generated $19 billion in operating cash flow in 2018. Structure and Governance Upon completion of the transaction, AbbVie will continue to be incorporated in Delaware as AbbVie Inc. and have its principal executive offices in North Chicago, Ill. AbbVie will continue to be led by Richard A. Gonzalez as chairman and chief executive officer. Two members of Allergans Board, including chairman and chief executive officer, Brent Saunders, will join AbbVies Board upon completion of the transaction. Transaction Details Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Allergan Shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie Shares and $120.30 in cash for each Allergan Share that they hold, for a total consideration of $188.24 per Allergan Share. 2 The transaction represents a 45% premium to the closing price of Allergans Shares on June 24, 2019. AbbVie anticipates that the Acquisition will provide annual pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in year three while leaving investments in key growth franchises untouched. The synergies and other cost reductions will be a result of optimizing the research and early stage portfolio, and reducing overlapping R&D resources (~50%), driving efficiencies in SG&A, including sales and marketing and central support function costs (~40%), and eliminating redundancies in manufacturing and supply chain, and leveraging procurement spend (~10%). The synergies estimate excludes any potential revenue synergies. 3 AbbVie is expected to generate significant annual operating cash flow, which will support a debt reduction target of $15 to $18 billion before the end of 2021, while also enabling a continued commitment to Baa2/BBB or better credit rating and continued dividend growth. It is expected that, immediately after the closing of the Acquisition, AbbVie Shareholders will own approximately 83% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis and the Allergan Shareholders will own approximately 17% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis. 1 The statement that this transaction is earnings accretive should not be interpreted to mean that the earnings per share in the current or any future financial period will necessarily match or be greater than those for the relevant preceding financial period. 2 Subject to adjustment in accordance with the Exchange Ratio Modification Number. 3 There are various material assumptions underlying the synergies and other cost reductions which may result in the synergies and other cost reductions being materially greater or less than estimated. The estimates should therefore be read in conjunction with the bases and assumptions for these synergy numbers which are set out in Appendix I of this announcement. The synergies and other cost reductions have been reported on in accordance with Rule 19.3(b) of the Irish Takeover Rules by (i) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and (ii) Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc. Copies of their respective reports are included in Appendix IV and Appendix V to this announcement. Each of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc has given and not withdrawn its consent to the issue of this announcement with the inclusion of its report and context in which it is included. The synergy and earnings enhancement statements in this section should not be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that the earnings of AbbVie and/or Allergan in 2019, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of AbbVie and/or Allergan for the relevant financial period or any other period. The synergies estimate excludes any potential revenue synergies. 2 The transaction is subject to the Conditions set out in Appendix III of the Rule 2.5 Announcement, including certain regulatory approvals and approval by Allergans Shareholders.

This transaction achieves unique and complementary strategic objectives for both organizations. Combining Allergans diversified on-market product portfolio with AbbVies growth platform and deep expertise in R&D, commercial strength and international footprint will create a leading biopharmaceutical company with approximately $48 billion in combined 2019 revenue. This combination also enhances AbbVies ability for robust investment in its industry-leading pipeline of innovative therapies throughout the next decade and enables AbbVie to deliver on its mission to better serve patients. The financial benefits include immediate 10% earnings-per-share accretion over the first full year of the combination, with peak accretion of greater than 20%. The transaction will generate annual pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in year three, with a return on invested capital to exceed AbbVies cost of capital within the first full year. 2. When do you anticipate this transaction to close and what is the leadership structure for the new combined company? We anticipate closing of the transaction by early 2020, subject to regulatory and Allergans shareholder approvals. The combined company will continue to be incorporated in Delaware and have its principal executive offices in North Chicago, Ill. Richard A. Gonzalez will serve as the chairman and chief executive officer through the Humira loss of exclusivity in 2023. AbbVies Board will include two Allergan board members, including Allergans chairman and chief executive officer, Brent Saunders. 3. Does this transaction represent a change in your fundamental strategy for AbbVie? 3 This transaction enhances our ability to continue to advance our mission to develop a consistent stream of innovative medicines to create a remarkable impact on peoples lives. AbbVie will now have a more diversified product portfolio with several leadership positions in high value therapeutic areas and an industry-leading pipeline of next-generation therapies with ensured capacity for continued investment across our innovative pipeline. 4. What is the benefit of doing a transaction of this size versus smaller bolt-on acquisitions? This transaction is designed to meet a different strategic imperative than smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Its ability to deliver immediate scale to the AbbVie growth platform with Allergans on-market diversified product portfolio meets our strategic goal to reduce reliance on Humira and allows us to continue expanding our focus on high-innovation science throughout the next decade. Smaller bolt-on acquisitions provide opportunities for future growth, but also require significant R&D investment amid scientific and clinical uncertainty. This transaction offers immediate compelling financial and strategic value to our shareholders with a much lower risk profile. 5. What is your level of confidence in your ability to operate the combined company given that it represents somewhat of a change in the mix of businesses from what AbbVie has been? We are highly confident in our ability to enhance the value of Allergans existing commercial franchises and capitalize on next-generation pipeline programs. AbbVie has a proven track record of industry leading financial performance and commercial expertise in building market-leading franchises in immunology, hematologic oncology, and other areas, and our geographic scale will enable us to unlock additional value in Allergans franchises. Our senior leadership team is experienced in leading diverse businesses and we are confident in our future success. 6. What are your plans for capital allocation for the combined company? How do you intend to address the debt levels of the combined company? The combined company will produce robust cash flow which will support continued growth of our dividend, further investment in our pipeline, and reduction of debt. We intend to reduce debt levels by $15-$18 billion by the end of 2021, with further deleveraging through 2023. 7. What do you view as the largest risks associated with the transaction? Any transaction of this magnitude involves a series of regulatory approvals and integration complexities. Both companies have organizations that are highly experienced at integrating businesses and we expect that process to be efficient and thorough.

Introduction The AbbVie Board and the Independent Allergan Directors announced today that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition of Allergan in a transaction valued at approximately $ 63 billion of equity value. The Acquisition will be effected by means of a Scheme under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Act. The Acquisition will be on the terms and subject to the conditions set out below, and the implementation of the Acquisition and the Scheme will be subject to the Conditions referred to in Appendix III of this announcement, which will also be set out in the Scheme Document . 2. Consideration Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the AbbVie Board and the Independent Allergan Directors, at completion Allergan Shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie Shares and $120.30 in cash (and Cash Consideration in lieu of Fractional Entitlements) for each Allergan Share that they hold. 4 Based on the closing price for AbbVie common stock on June 24, 2019, the last trading day prior to the date of this announcement, Allergan Shareholders will receive cash and shares valued at $188.24 per Allergan Share, representing a premium of 45% to the closing price of Allergans ordinary shares on June 24, 2019, the last trading day prior to the date of this announcement and a transaction equity value of approximately $63 billion. The Acquisition is expected to be taxable, to the Allergan Shareholders, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected that, immediately after the closing of the Acquisition, AbbVie Shareholders will own approximately 83% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis and the Allergan Shareholders will own approximately 17% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis. AbbVie has secured fully underwritten financing commitments from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and MUFG Bank, Ltd., for an aggregate amount of US$38.0 billion, to finance together with AbbVies own cash resources, the cash portion of the Acquisition. 4 Subject to adjustment in accordance with the Exchange Ratio Modification Number. 10 3. AbbVie Background to and Reasons for the Acquisition As a part of its on-going review of AbbVies long-term strategy, the AbbVie Board regularly considers strategic opportunities that might be available to enhance shareholder value, including additional investments in new growth opportunities and potential acquisitions. Beginning in late April of 2019, senior management of AbbVie and Allergan had a series of discussions regarding the possibility of an acquisition by AbbVie of Allergan and the possible terms of such a transaction. In connection with a possible transaction, AbbVie retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC in late May of 2019 as its financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and McCann FitzGerald as its legal advisors. During the period preceding the execution of definitive documentation for the Acquisition on June 25, 2019, the parties discussed and negotiated the transaction terms, conducted due diligence with respect to each others businesses and consulted with the Panel, and AbbVie arranged financing for the transaction. On June 24, 2019, the AbbVie Board met, together with AbbVies senior management and financial and legal advisors, to consider proposed terms and drafts of definitive documentation for a proposed acquisition by AbbVie of Allergan. At this meeting, AbbVies Board unanimously determined that the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Acquisition, were in the best interests of AbbVie and its stockholders, and thereby authorized and approved the Acquisition. AbbVie s Board believes that the Acquisition will create a more diversified pharmaceutical company, positioned for success in current and future health care markets. Following the Acquisition, AbbVie will have market leading positions in multiple therapeutic categories, a more diversified product portfolio, and strong cash flow. In reaching its decision to authorize and approve the Acquisition, the AbbVie Board consulted with and received advice and reports from AbbVies senior management and its financial and legal advisors, and drew on its knowledge of AbbVies business, assets, financial position, operating results, historical and current trading prices of its securities, and the opportunities and challenges in its businesses and the industries in which it operates, as well as information relating to Allergan and the potential opportunities available to and future business prospects of the combined company. Further detail in respect of the background and reasons for the Acquisition will be included in the Proxy Statement. 4. Allergan Background to and Reasons for Recommending the Acquisition The Allergan Directors have on an ongoing basis considered the long-term strategy of Allergan and strategic opportunities that might be available to enhance shareholder value, including additional investments in new growth opportunities, potential acquisitions and the possible sale of Allergan as well as a potential spin off of certain of Allergans businesses. Beginning in late April of 2019, senior management of AbbVie and Allergan had a series of discussions regarding the possibility of an acquisition by AbbVie of Allergan and the possible terms of such a transaction. In connection with a possible transaction, Allergan retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as its financial advisor and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox as its legal advisors. During the period preceding the execution of definitive documentation for the Acquisition on June 25, 2019, the parties discussed and negotiated the transaction terms, conducted due diligence with respect to each others businesses and consulted with the Panel. Also during this period, the Independent Allergan Directors met, together with Allergans senior management and its financial and legal advisors, on various occasions to consider the merits of a potential transaction with AbbVie and the status of the discussions and negotiations between the parties. On June 23, 2019, the Independent Allergan Directors met, together with Allergans senior management and financial and legal advisors, to consider proposed terms and drafts of definitive documentation for a proposed acquisition by AbbVie of Allergan. At this meeting, the Independent Allergan Directors unanimously determined that the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Scheme, were advisable for, fair to and in the 11 best interests of Allergan and the Allergan Shareholders, and thereby approved the Acquisition and determined that the terms of the Scheme were fair and reasonable. In reaching its decision to approve the Acquisition, the Independent Allergan Directors consulted with and received advice and reports from Allergans senior management and its financial and legal advisors, and drew on its knowledge of Allergans business, assets, financial position, operating results, historical and current trading prices of its securities, and the opportunities and challenges in its businesses and the industries in which it operates, as well as information relating to AbbVie and the potential opportunities available to and future business prospects of the combined company. After giving consideration to these and a variety of other factors and risks, the Independent Allergan Directors unanimously determined to recommend that Allergan Shareholders vote in favor of the Acquisition. Further detail in respect of the background and reasons for the Acquisition will be included in the Proxy Statement. 5. Allergan Recommendation The Independent Allergan Directors, who have been so advised by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as to the financial terms of the Acquisition, consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and reasonable. In providing its advice, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has taken into account the commercial assessments of the Independent Allergan Directors. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as independent financial adviser to the Independent Allergan Directors in relation to the Acquisition for the purposes of Rule 3 of the Takeover Rules. Accordingly, the Independent Allergan Directors unanimously recommend to Allergan Shareholders to vote in favor of the Acquisition and the Scheme, as the Independent Allergan Directors who are Allergan Shareholders intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings of, in the aggregate, 63,690 Allergan Shares. Thomas C. Freyman is not participating in the Independent Allergan Directors recommendation of the Acquisition and related matters as Mr. Freyman is regarded under Rule 3 of the Irish Takeover Rules as having a conflict of interest due to Mr. Freymans shareholding in AbbVie . 6. The Acquisition and the Scheme The Acquisition will be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement in accordance with Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Act pursuant to which Acquirer Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, will acquire all of the outstanding Allergan Shares in exchange for 0.8660 AbbVie Shares and $120.30 in cash (and Cash Consideration in lieu of Fractional Entitlements) per Allergan Share, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Exchange Ratio Modification Number. The Acquisition will be subject to the Conditions set out in Appendix III to this announcement and to be set forth in the Scheme described in the Scheme Document which will be delivered to Allergan Shareholders. To become effective, the Scheme will require, among other things, the approval of the Scheme by a majority in number of members of each class of Allergan Shareholders (including as may be directed by the High Court pursuant to Section 450(5) of the Act) present and voting either in person or by proxy at the Court Meeting (or at any adjournment or postponement of such meeting) representing, at the relevant voting record time, at least 75% in value of the Allergan Shares of that class held by such Allergan Shareholders and (ii) the Required EGM Resolutions being duly passed by the requisite majorities of Allergan Shareholders at the EGM (or any adjournment or postponement thereof). Following the Allergan Shareholder Approval being obtained and the satisfaction or (where applicable) waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the Scheme, the sanction of the Irish High Court is also required. The Acquisition, which is unanimously recommended by the AbbVie Board and the Independent Allergan Directors, is also subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals and certain other conditions, as more particularly set out in Appendix III of this announcement. Assuming the necessary approvals from the Allergan Shareholders have been obtained and all other conditions have been satisfied or waived (where applicable), the Scheme will become effective upon delivery to the Irish Registrar of Companies of a copy of the Court Order of the Irish High Court sanctioning the Scheme together with the minute required by section 86 of the Act confirming a capital reduction to take place in connection with the Acquisition and registration of the Court Order and minute by the Irish Registrar of Companies. Upon the Scheme becoming effective, 12 the Scheme will be binding on all Allergan Shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the Court Meeting or the EGM. The Acquisition will be conditional upon the Scheme becoming effective. The Conditions to the Acquisition and the Scheme are set out in full in Appendix III to this announcement. The implementation of the Scheme is conditional, amongst other things, upon: (a) the approval by the Allergan Shareholders and the sanction by the Irish High Court of the Scheme; (b) the approval for listing on NYSE (subject only to certain standard conditions) of all of the AbbVie Shares to be issued in the Acquisition; (c) all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act in connection with the Acquisition having expired or having been terminated, and, to the extent applicable, any agreement between Allergan and AbbVie, on the one hand, and the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, on the other hand, not to consummate the Scheme or the Acquisition having expired or been earlier terminated; (d) to the extent (i) the Acquisition constitutes a concentration within the scope of the EC Merger Regulation or otherwise is a concentration that is subject to the EC Merger Regulation, the European Commission having decided to allow the closing of the Acquisition, and (ii) that all or part of the Acquisition is referred by the European Commission to the relevant authority of one or more member countries of the European Economic Area, such relevant authority(ies) (in the case of a partial referral in conjunction with a final decision of the European Commission) having issued a final decision or decisions which satisfies (or together satisfy) the prior clause (i) (that clause being interpreted mutatis mutandis ); (e) all required Clearances of any Governmental Entity having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect and all applicable waiting periods having expired, lapsed or been terminated (as appropriate), in each case in connection with the Acquisition, under the Antitrust Laws of each Required Antitrust Jurisdiction, and (a) no order, writ, decree, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary or permanent) shall have been issued, promulgated, made, rendered or entered into by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, and (b) no Law other than an order, writ, decree, judgement or injunction described in clause (a) (whether or not final or appealable) (excluding, for the purpose of this clause (b), any Antitrust Law of any jurisdiction that is not a Required Antitrust Jurisdiction) s hall have been enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered and continue in effect and, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), restrain, enjoin, make illegal or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Acquisition; (f) the Transaction Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms; (g) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to each party; (h) the accuracy of each of the parties representations and warranties, except generally as would not have a material adverse effect on such party; and (i) the performance by each party, in all material respects, with all of its covenants and agreements under the Transaction Agreement. The Scheme Document, containing further information relating to the implementation of the Acquisition, the full terms and Conditions of the Scheme, and the notices of the Court Meeting, to be convened by resolution of the Allergan Board or direction of the Irish High Court, and the separate EGM required to approve the Scheme and related resolutions will be mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable after securing approval of the High Court to despatch such documents to Allergan Shareholders and, for information only, to holders of Allergan Options and Allergan Share Awards. 13 The Proxy Statement will contain important information about the Acquisition (including the Scheme), the Transaction Agreement, the Court Meeting and the EGM. 7. Merger Benefit Statement AbbVie anticipates that the Acquisition will provide annual pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in year three while leaving investments in key growth franchises untouched. The synergies and other cost reductions will be a result of optimizing the research and early stage portfolio, and reducing overlapping R&D resources (~50%), driving efficiencies in SG&A, including sales and marketing and central support function costs (~40%), and eliminating redundancies in manufacturing and supply chain, and leveraging procurement spend (~10%). The synergies estimate excludes any potential revenue synergies. Subject to the Scheme becoming effective, Allergan Shareholders will be able to share in the synergies and other cost reductions resulting from the Acquisition by means of the AbbVie Shares they will receive as part of the Scheme Consideration. There are various material assumptions underlying the synergies and other cost reductions estimates which may result in the synergies and other cost reductions being materially greater or less than estimated. The estimate of synergies and other cost reductions should therefore be read in conjunction with the key assumptions underlying the estimates set out in Appendix I of this announcement. The synergies and other cost reductions statements should not be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that AbbVies profits or earnings in the first full year following the Acquisition, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of AbbVie and/or Allergan for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period. The estimate of synergies set out in this announcement has been reported on for the purposes of Rule 19.3(b)(ii) of the Irish Takeover Rules by (i) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and (ii) Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc. Copies of their respective reports are included in Appendix IV and Appendix V to this announcement. Each of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc has given and not withdrawn its consent to the issue of this announcement with the inclusion of its report. 8.

Effect of the Scheme on Allergan Options and Allergan Share Awards Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Allergans outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows: (i) each unexercised Allergan Option will be substituted with an Allergan Replacement Option, with the exercise price per AbbVie Share and the number of AbbVie Shares underlying the Allergan Replacement Option adjusted to reflect the conversion from Allergan Shares into AbbVie Shares, and (ii) each other Allergan Share Award, including Allergan RSU Awards, Allergan PSUs and Allergan Restricted Stock Awards, will be substituted with an Allergan Replacement Share Award, with the number of AbbVie Shares underlying each such Allergan Replacement Share Award adjusted to reflect the conversion from Allergan Shares into AbbVie Shares. AbbVie restricted stock unit awards will be granted in substitution for Allergan PSUs, and the number of AbbVie Shares underlying each Allergan PSU with a performance period that remains subject to performance vesting conditions as of the date of the Transaction Agreement ( i.e. , any Allergan PSU for which the level of performance has not been determined) will equal 130% of the target number of Allergan Shares subject to such Allergan PSU. Each Allergan Replacement Option and Allergan Replacement Share Award will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, for each Allergan PSU, the time vesting conditions provided in the applicable award agreement, but excluding any performance-based vesting conditions) that applied to the corresponding Allergan Option or Allergan Share Award, as applicable (except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Acquisition or for immaterial administrative or ministerial changes that are not adverse to any holder other than in any de minimis respect) . 11. Management and Employees Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, AbbVie has given certain assurances in relation to the continuation of certain existing compensation and employment benefit arrangements of Allergans employees following the Acquisition. Further details in this regard will be included in the Scheme Document. 12. Delisting of Allergan Shares It is intended that, subject to and following the Scheme becoming effective, and subject to applicable requirements of the NYSE, the Allergan Shares will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered, along with other securities of Allergan under the Exchange Act, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. 13. Financing AbbVie has secured fully underwritten financing commitments from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and MUFG Bank, Ltd., for an aggregate amount of US$38.0 billion, to finance together with AbbVies own cash resources, the cash portion of the Acquisition. Further information on the financing of the Acquisition will be set out in the Scheme Document . Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, acting through its affiliate Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, financial advisor to AbbVie, is satisfied that sufficient resources are available to satisfy in full the Cash Consideration payable to Allergan Shareholders under the terms of the Acquisition. 14. Expenses Reimbursement Agreement Allergan has entered into the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, dated June 25, 2019 with AbbVie, the terms of which have been approved by the Panel. Under the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, Allergan has agreed to pay to AbbVie in certain circumstances an amount equal to all documented, specific, quantifiable third party costs and expenses incurred, directly or indirectly, by AbbVie and/or its subsidiaries, or on their behalf, for the purposes of, in preparation for, or in connection with the Acquisition, including, but not limited to, third party costs and expenses 15 incurred in connection with exploratory work carried out in contemplation of and in connection with the Acquisition, legal, financial and commercial due diligence, the arrangement of financing and the engagement of third party representatives to assist in the process. The liability of Allergan to pay these amounts shall arise only after the date of this announcement and is limited to a maximum amount equal to 1% of the aggregate value of the total Scheme Consideration (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest in such share capital of Allergan held by AbbVie or any Concert Parties of AbbVie). The circumstances in which such payment will be made are if: (a) the Transaction Agreement is terminated: (i) by AbbVie at any time prior to the receipt of the Allergan Shareholder Approval, due to an Allergan Change of Recommendation having occurred; or (ii) by Allergan, at any time prior to obtaining the Allergan Shareholder Approval, in response to an Allergan Superior Proposal and, substantially concurrently with such termination, a written definitive agreement providing for the consummation of transactions contemplated by such Allergan Superior Proposal is duly executed and delivered by Allergan and all other parties thereto; or (b) all of the following occur: (i) the Transaction Agreement is terminated (x) by AbbVie if Allergan breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in the Transaction Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1) would have resulted in a failure of the Condition set forth in paragraph 4(iii) of Appendix III and (2) was not reasonably capable of being cured by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of (a) the End Date and (b) 30 days following written notice by AbbVie thereof or (y) by AbbVie or Allergan, if the Court Meeting or the EGM was completed and the Court Meeting Resolution or the Required EGM Resolutions, as applicable, were not approved by the requisite majorities; and (ii) prior to the Court Meeting, an Allergan Alternative Proposal was publicly disclosed or announced (or, in the case of a termination described in paragraph (b)(i)(x) above, was made publicly or privately to the Allergan Board), or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Allergan Alternative Proposal (it being understood that, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(ii) and paragraph (b)(iii) below, references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Allergan Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to refer to fifty percent (50)%); and (iii) (x) an Allergan Alternative Proposal is consummated within twelve months after such termination, or (y) a definitive agreement providing for an Allergan Alternative Proposal is entered into within twelve months after such termination and which is subsequently consummated, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), regardless of whether such Allergan Alternative Proposal is the same Allergan Alternative Proposal referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) above. Each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and the Independent Allergan Directors have confirmed in writing to the Panel that, in the opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and the Independent Allergan Directors (respectively), in the context of the note to Rule 21.2 of the Takeover Rules and the Acquisition, the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement is in the best interests of the Allergan Shareholders. The Panel has consented to Allergan entering into the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement. 15. Transaction Agreement AbbVie, Allergan and Acquirer Sub have entered into the Transaction Agreement dated June 25, 2019 which contains certain assurances, obligations and commitments in relation to the implementation of the Scheme, including provisions 16 in relation to the conduct of Allergans business between the date of this announcement and the Effective Date and other matters relating to the Acquisition.

Rule 30.2 Derogation Rule 30.2 of the Irish Takeover Rules requires that, except with the consent of the Panel, and subject to Rule 2.7 of the Irish Takeover Rules, Allergan must despatch the Scheme Document to Allergan Shareholders within 28 days of the announcement of a firm intention to make an offer, being this announcement.

There is a requirement to file the Proxy Statement (which will also contain the Scheme Document) with the SEC in connection with the Scheme. The preparation of the Proxy Statement may take more than 28 days. Also, the SEC may elect to review the Proxy Statement. This review process may take 60 days or more to complete. Under SEC rules, the Proxy Statement may not be despatched to Allergans Shareholders until such review is complete. The Panel granted the derogation on the basis that the Scheme Document cannot be despatched until the SECs review of the Proxy Statement is completed. The Scheme Document will be despatched to Allergans Shareholders as soon as practicable after a definitive Proxy Statement is filed. 19. General The Acquisition and the Scheme will be made subject to the Conditions and the further terms and conditions to be set out in the Scheme Document.

In such event, the Acquisition will be implemented on terms at least as favourable, so far as applicable, as those which would apply to the Scheme, subject to appropriate amendments (including an acceptance condition set at 80% of the shares to which such offer relates). The Transaction Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. However, the Acquisition and the Scheme and matters related thereto (including matters related to the Takeover Rules) shall, to the extent required by the laws of Ireland, be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Ireland.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to a possible acquisition involving AbbVie and Allergan and AbbVies, Allergans and/or the combined groups estimated or anticipated future business, performance and results of operations and financial condition, including estimates, forecasts, targets and plans for AbbVie and, following the Acquisition, if completed, the combined company. The words believe, expect, anticipate, project and similar expressions, among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that a possible acquisition will not be pursued, failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or required financing or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the possible acquisition, adverse effects on the market price of AbbVies shares of common stock or Allergans ordinary shares and on AbbVies or Allergans operating results because of a failure to complete the possible acquisition, failure to realize the expected benefits of the possible acquisition, failure to promptly and effectively integrate Allergans businesses, negative effects relating to the announcement of the possible acquisition or any further announcements relating to the possible acquisition or the consummation of the possible acquisition on the market price of AbbVies shares of common stock or Allergans ordinary shares, significant transaction costs and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities, potential litigation associated with the possible acquisition, general economic and business conditions that affect the combined companies following the consummation of the possible acquisition, changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies, future business acquisitions or disposals and competitive developments.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future.

The bases of belief (including sources of information and assumptions made) that support the expected synergies and other cost reductions are set out in the following paragraphs. The estimate of synergies has been reported on in accordance with Rule 19.3(b)(ii) of the Irish Takeover Rules. 6. The expected sources of the estimated pre-tax synergies are: (a) optimizing the research and early stage portfolio, and reducing overlapping R&D resources; (b) driving efficiencies in SG&A including sales and marketing, and central support function costs; and (c) eliminating redundancies in manufacturing and supply chain, and leveraging procurement spend. 7. When evaluating potential annual pre-tax cost synergies and other cost reductions the AbbVie Board has assumed the following: (a) The cost bases for the quantification exercise are: 25 (i) in respect of AbbVie, the four months actual cost base to 30 April 2019 plus eight months of the latest forecast cost base to 31 December 2019; and (ii) in respect of Allergan, the three months actual cost base to 31 March 2019 plus nine months of the latest forecast cost base to 31 December 2019; (b) that the Scheme will become effective and AbbVie, through Acquirer Sub, will acquire 100% of the issued and to be issued share capital of Allergan on completion of the Acquisition; (c) that there will be no material unanticipated impact on the combined company arising from any decisions made by competition authorities; (d) that there will be no material change to the market dynamics affecting AbbVie and/or Allergan following completion of the Acquisition; and (e) that there will be no material change to exchange rates following completion of the Acquisition. 8. In establishing the estimate of pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions the AbbVie Board has assumed that Allergans operations, processes and procedures are comparable to those of AbbVies related operations, except where publicly available information clearly indicates otherwise or the due diligence materials provided by Allergan to AbbVie indicated otherwise. 9. AbbVies management, aided by its previous integration experience and through an understanding of Allergans operations and cost structure based on their own market intelligence and experience, and due diligence materials provided by Allergan, has determined the source and scale of potential pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions. The pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions are incremental to AbbVies and, to the best of AbbVies knowledge, Allergans existing plans. 10. In addition to information from AbbVies and Allergans respective management teams, the sources of information that AbbVie has used to arrive at the estimate of potential pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions include: (a) the Allergan annual report and accounts; (b) Allergan presentations to analysts; (c) Allergans website; (d) analysts research; (e) other public information; (f) AbbVies knowledge of the industry and of Allergan; and (g) AbbVies experience of synergies from previous transactions. 11. There remains an inherent risk in the synergy forward-looking statements. No synergy statement in this announcement, including any statement that the Acquisition will be accretive, should be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that AbbVies earnings in the first full year following the Scheme, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of AbbVie and/or Allergan for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period. 26 APPENDIX II DEFINITIONS The following definitions apply throughout this announcement unless the context otherwise requires: AbbVie Board means the board of directors

Section 4.4 Reasonable Best Efforts . Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Article 4 , including having the applicable board or committee administering the plans governing the affected awards, adopt resolutions necessary to effect the foregoing.

(b) In addition, Acquirer Sub shall provide, and AbbVie shall cause Acquirer Sub to provide , to each Allergan Employee who experiences a termination of employment during the Benefits Continuation Period, severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits to which such Allergan Employee would have been entitled upon such a termination of employment under any Allergan Benefit Plan that is a severance plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement and set forth on Section 7.4(b) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the  Severance Arrangements ) and in which such Allergan Employee was eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, but only to the extent such Severance Arrangements are set forth on Section 7.4(b) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule and were furnished to the Buyer prior to the date hereof.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Allergan Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under an Allergan Benefit Plan in which such Allergan Employee had already satisfied any such waiting period and participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the  Old Plans ), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Allergan Employee, AbbVie shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause (1) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such conditions under the comparable Old Plans, and (2) any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her 76 covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

Section 7.13 Acquirer Sub . Until the Effective Time, AbbVie shall at all times be the direct or indirect owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Acquirer Sub.

No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit of holders of the Allergan Shares on the Scheme Consideration payable in respect of the Allergan Shares. (iii) Termination of Allergan Exchange Fund . Any portion of the Exchange Fund which has not been transferred to the holders of Allergan Shares within twelve months of the Completion Date shall be delivered to AbbVie or its designee(s) promptly upon demand by AbbVie, it being understood that no such delivery shall affect any legal right that an Allergan Shareholder may have to receive the Scheme Consideration. 86 (iv) No Liability . None of AbbVie, Acquirer Sub, Allergan or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any person in respect of any Scheme Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Allergan Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. (v) Withholding . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, AbbVie, Allergan, the Exchange Agent and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of an Allergan Share subject to the Scheme such amounts as AbbVie, Allergan, the Exchange Agent or such Affiliate is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid. ARTICLE 9 TERMINATION Section 9.1 Termination . (a) This Agreement may be terminated and the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding receipt of the Allergan Shareholder Approval (except in the case of Section 9.1(a)(ii)(B) or Section 9.1(a)(iii)(B) ): (i) by either Allergan or AbbVie: (A) if the Court Meeting or the EGM shall have been completed and the Court Meeting Resolution or the Required EGM Resolutions, as applicable, shall not have been approved by the requisite majorities; or (B) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the End Date, provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(i)(B) shall not be available to a Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement shall have been the primary cause of the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred by such time; (C) if the High Court shall decline or refuse to sanction the Scheme, unless both Parties agree in writing that the decision of the High Court shall be appealed (it being agreed that Allergan shall make such an appeal if requested to do so in writing by AbbVie and the counsel appointed by AbbVie and by Allergan agree that doing so is a reasonable course of action); 87 (D) if there shall be in effect any (x) Law other than an order, writ, decree, judgment or injunction described in clause (y) (whether or not final or appealable) (excluding any such Antitrust Law of any jurisdiction that is not a jurisdiction listed on Section 7.2(b) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule) in any jurisdiction of competent authority or (y) final and non-appealable order, writ, decree, judgment, or injunction issued, promulgated, made, rendered or entered into by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, that, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), permanently restrains, enjoins, makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Acquisition; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(i)(D) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement shall have been the primary cause of such Law, order, writ, decree, judgment, or injunction; (ii) by Allergan: (A) if any AbbVie Party shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement or if any of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement are inaccurate, which breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy (1) would result in a failure of Condition 5(ii) or 5(iii) and (2) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of (x) the End Date and (y) 30 days following written notice by Allergan thereof; (B) prior to obtaining the Allergan Shareholder Approval, if (1) in accordance with Section 5.3 , the Allergan Board shall have authorized Allergan to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(a)(ii)(B) in response to an Allergan Superior Proposal and (2) substantially concurrently with such termination, a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of such Allergan Superior Proposal is duly executed and delivered by all parties thereto and, prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination, Allergan pays AbbVie any amounts due under the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement (it being understood that, without limiting Allergans obligations under the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, only such costs and expenses for which AbbVie shall have submitted to Allergan in writing a request for such amounts and written invoices or written documentation supporting such request prior to such termination in accordance with the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement shall be due substantially concurrently with such termination); (iii) by AbbVie: (A) if Allergan shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this 88 Agreement or if any of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement are inaccurate, which breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy (1) would result in a failure of Condition 4(ii) or 4(iii) and (2) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of (x) the End Date and (y) 30 days following written notice by AbbVie thereof; (B) if, prior to the receipt of the Allergan Shareholder Approval, an Allergan Change of Recommendation shall have occurred; and (iv) by mutual written consent of Allergan and AbbVie. (b) The valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 9.1(a) shall not give rise to any liability of the Parties except as provided in the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, in the proviso to Section 9.1(c) and in Section 9.2 . Section 7.9(c) and Article 10 (other than Section 10.1 and 10.12 ) of this Agreement shall survive, and continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding its termination. (c) Subject to the proviso in this Section 9.1(c) , upon valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with this Article 9 , neither Party nor any of its Affiliates or its and their Representatives or shareholders shall have any liability in connection with this Agreement or the Acquisition, other than the obligation of Allergan (if applicable) to pay the AbbVie Reimbursement Payments pursuant to the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement) and the obligation of AbbVie (if applicable) to pay Allergan the Reverse Termination Payment; provided , however , that nothing herein shall release any Party from liability (including any monetary damages or other appropriate remedy) for Willful Breach or for fraud or as provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement. (d) For clarity, termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the provisions of the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement. Section 9.2 Certain Effects of Termination . (a) In the event of a Specified Termination, then AbbVie shall pay to Allergan $1,250,000,000 (the  Reverse Termination Payment ) in cleared, immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days thereafter; provided , that Allergan shall not be entitled to receive the Reverse Termination Payment if Allergans breach of this Agreement shall have been the primary cause of such Specified Termination. (b)  Specified Termination  means a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to: (i) Section 9.1(a)(i)(B) if, on the date of such termination, each of the Conditions has been satisfied (other than any of Conditions 3(ii), 3(iii), 3(iv), 3(v) or 3(vi)(d) (which failure to be satisfied, in the case of each of Conditions 3(v) and 3(vi)(d), results pursuant to or in connection with an Antitrust Law in any jurisdiction listed on Section 7.2(b) of the 89 Allergan Disclosure Schedule), or any Condition that by its nature can only be satisfied on the Sanction Date); or (ii) Section 9.1(a)(i)(D) pursuant to or in connection with an Antitrust Law in any jurisdiction listed on Section 7.2(b) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule. (c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the Acquisition and that the Reverse Termination Payment is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate Allergan in the circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Acquisition, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In addition, if AbbVie fails to pay in a timely manner the Reverse Termination Payment, then AbbVie shall reimburse Allergan for its reasonable costs and expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in connection with any Action to obtain such payment, together with interest on the Reverse Termination Payment from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

AbbVie and Allergan shall each give the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any such public announcement and shall not issue any such public announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any securities exchange or Governmental Entity (including the Panel). For clarity, the provisions of this Section 10.1 do not apply to any announcement, document or publication in connection with an Allergan Alternative Proposal, Allergan Superior Proposal or an Allergan Change of Recommendation or any amendment to the terms of the Scheme proposed by AbbVie that would effect an increase in the Scheme Consideration whether before or after an Allergan Change of Recommendation.

Section 10.4 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement, and each Party may enter into this Agreement by executing a counterpart and delivering it to the other Party (by hand delivery, facsimile process, e-mail or otherwise). Section 10.5 Amendment . No amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless the same shall be evidenced in writing duly executed by each of the Parties, except that, following approval by the Allergan Shareholders, there shall be no amendment to the provisions hereof which by applicable Law would require further approval by the Allergan Shareholders without such further approval nor shall there be any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 10.5 , Sections 10.13(c) and 10.13(d) , Section 10.14 and Section 10.15 may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of such Financing Sources party to any definitive agreement relating to the Financing (it being expressly agreed that the Financing Sources in their capacities as such shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 10.5 and shall be entitled to the protections of the provisions contained in this Section 10.5 as if they were a party to this Agreement). Section 10.6 Entire Agreement . This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, the Rule 2.5 Announcement and any documents delivered by AbbVie and Allergan in connection herewith (including the AbbVie Disclosure Schedule and the Allergan Disclosure Schedule), constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between AbbVie and Allergan with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Section 10.7 Inadequacy of Damages . The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law (i) for any breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that, except where this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 , the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages, and each Party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.

(b) The Parties agree that in no event shall any disclosure contained in any part of any Allergan SEC Document or AbbVie SEC Document entitled Risk Factors, Forward-Looking Statements, Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements or Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements or any other disclosures in any Allergan SEC Document or AbbVie SEC Document that are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of or otherwise qualify) any representations and warranties of any Party contained in this Agreement.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation (AbbVie), issued an announcement (the Rule 2.5 Announcement) pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the Irish Takeover Rules disclosing that the boards of directors of AbbVie and Allergan plc, an Irish public limited company (Allergan), had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition of Allergan by AbbVie (the Acquisition). In connection with the Acquisition, (i) AbbVie, Allergan and Venice Subsidiary LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie (Acquirer Sub), entered into a Transaction Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2019 (the Transaction Agreement), (ii) AbbVie and Allergan entered into an Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2019 (the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement), and (iii) AbbVie, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (Morgan Stanley), as administrative agent, and certain other parties entered into a 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2019 (the Bridge Credit Agreement). Rule 2.5 Announcement On June 25, 2019, AbbVie issued the Rule 2.5 Announcement disclosing that the boards of directors of AbbVie and Allergan had reached agreement on the terms of the Acquisition. The Acquisition will be effected by means of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement (the Scheme) under Irish law pursuant to which Acquirer Sub will acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Allergan (Allergan Shares) in exchange for 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock (AbbVie Shares) and $120.30 in cash (and any cash in lieu of fractions of AbbVie Shares due to a holder of Allergan Shares) per Allergan Share, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Exchange Ratio Modification Number (as defined in the Transaction Agreement). The Acquisition will be conditioned upon, among other things, the approval of the Scheme by the Allergan shareholders , the sanction of the Scheme by the Irish High Court (the Court), the registration of the Court Order (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) with the Registrar of Companies in Dublin, Ireland and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The conditions to the Acquisition are set out in full in Appendix III to the Rule 2.5 Announcement (the Conditions Appendix). It is expected that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, the Acquisition will be completed in early 2020. AbbVie reserves the right, subject to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, to elect to implement the Acquisition by way of a takeover offer (as such term is defined in the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997 and Takeover Rules, 2013). Transaction Agreement On June 25, 2019, AbbVie, Allergan and Acquirer Sub entered into the Transaction Agreement in connection with the proposed Acquisition. The Transaction Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by AbbVie and Allergan. AbbVie and Allergan have agreed, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, that Allergan may not, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or take any action or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any offer or alternative proposal for specified alternative transactions or any indication, proposal or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to such an offer or proposal, (b) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding such an offer or proposal with, or furnish any information relating to Allergan or any of its subsidiaries to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort by, any person that would reasonably be expected to seek to make, or has made, such an offer or proposal or (c) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other agreement providing for or relating to such an offer or proposal. In addition, certain covenants require each of the parties to use, subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, their reasonable best efforts to cause the Acquisition to be consummated. Subject to certain exceptions, the Transaction Agreement also requires Allergan to hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders and requires the board of directors of Allergan to recommend approval of the Acquisition. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, upon completion of the Acquisition, two members of Allergans board of directors will join AbbVies board of directors. 2 The Transaction Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. The Transaction Agreement also contains certain customary termination rights, including, among others and subject to certain conditions, the right of either party to terminate if (a) the Scheme has not become effective by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 25, 2020, which period will be extended to September 25, 2020 in certain circumstances, (b) the requisite Allergan shareholder approvals are not obtained, (c) the other party breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements or any of the other partys representations or warranties are inaccurate and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy would result in certain of the closing conditions not being satisfied, subject to a cure period, (d) there is any final and non-appealable order, writ, decree, judgement or injunction by any court or other tribunal or any law (other than any antitrust law in a jurisdiction in which no antitrust clearance is required) that permanently restrains, enjoins, makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Acquisition or (e) the Court declines or refuses to sanction the Scheme, unless both parties agree in writing to appeal the decision. Allergan also has the right, prior to the receipt of the requisite Allergan shareholder approvals, to terminate the Transaction Agreement to accept an Allergan Superior Proposal (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) in certain circumstances and AbbVie also has the right, prior to receipt of the requisite Allergan shareholder approvals, to terminate the Transaction Agreement if an Allergan Change of Recommendation (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) occurs. The Transaction Agreement also provides that, upon termination of the Transaction Agreement under certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain antitrust approvals, AbbVie will pay Allergan a reverse termination fee of $1.25 billion . The Transaction Agreement contains representations and warranties made by and to the parties thereto as of specific dates. The statements embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the contract between the parties and may be subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of that contract. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Expenses Reimbursement Agreement On June 25, 2019, AbbVie and Allergan entered into an Expenses Reimbursement Agreement (the ERA), the terms of which have been approved by the Irish Takeover Panel. Under the ERA, Allergan has agreed to pay to AbbVie, in certain circumstances, an amount equal to all documented, specific and quantifiable third-party costs and expenses incurred, directly or indirectly, by AbbVie and/or its subsidiaries or on their behalf, for the purposes of, in preparation for, or in connection with the Acquisition. The maximum amount payable by Allergan to AbbVie pursuant to the ERA is an amount equal to 1% of the aggregate value of the total Scheme Consideration (as defined in the ERA). Bridge Credit Facility On June 25, 2019 (the Effective Date), AbbVie entered into the Bridge Credit Agreement among AbbVie, certain lenders and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as administrative agent. The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for a $38,000,000,000 bridge credit facility (the Bridge Credit Facility). The proceeds of the Bridge Credit Facility may be used to finance the payment of the cash consideration in connection with the Acquisition, fees and expenses related thereto and to repay certain existing indebtedness of Allergan. Advances under the Bridge Credit Facility will be available on a date after the Effective Date, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Bridge Credit Agreement (the Closing Date) and will mature on the date that is 364 days after the Closing Date. Borrowings under the Bridge Credit Facility may, at AbbVies election, bear interest at either (a) the base rate plus an applicable margin (Base Rate Loans) or (b) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin (Eurocurrency Rate Loans). The applicable margin ranges from 0.0% to 1.250% per annum for Base Rate Loans and 0.750% to 2.250% per annum for Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in each case depending on the public debt rating of AbbVie then in effect. The commitments under the Bridge Credit Facility will be reduced by the net cash proceeds received by AbbVie in connection with debt and equity issuances and non-ordinary course of business asset dispositions, other than certain debt issuances and non-ordinary course asset dispositions specified in the Bridge Credit Agreement. 3 The commitments under the Bridge Credit Facility, unless previously terminated, will terminate on the earlier of (i) the date on which all of the certain funds purposes have been achieved without the making of any advances under the facility and (ii) the time after a mandatory cancellation event occurs. The Bridge Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants, including a financial covenant that will apply after the Closing Date, and events of default. The Bridge Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of AbbVie depending on the amount of indebtedness that such subsidiaries incur or guarantee, as further set forth in the Bridge Credit Agreement.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This communication contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to a possible acquisition involving AbbVie and Allergan and AbbVies, Allergans and/or the combined groups estimated or anticipated future business, performance and results of operations and financial condition, including estimates, forecasts, targets and plans for AbbVie and, following the acquisition, if completed, the combined group. The words believe, expect, anticipate, project and similar expressions, among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that a possible acquisition will not be pursued, failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or required financing or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the possible acquisition, adverse effects on the market price of AbbVies shares of common stock or Allergans ordinary shares and on AbbVies or Allergans operating results because of a failure to complete the possible acquisition, failure to realize the expected benefits of the possible acquisition, failure to promptly and effectively integrate Allergans businesses, negative effects relating to the announcement of the possible acquisition or any further announcements relating to the possible acquisition or the consummation of the possible acquisition on the market price of AbbVies shares of common stock or Allergans ordinary shares, significant transaction costs and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities, potential litigation associated with the possible acquisition, general economic and business conditions that affect the combined companies following the consummation of the possible acquisition, changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies, future business acquisitions or disposals and competitive developments. These forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions and assessments made in light of AbbVies or, as the case may be, Allergans experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, business strategies, operating environment, future developments and other factors it believes appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future.

(NYSE: ABBV) and Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) announced that the companies have entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan in a cash and stock transaction for a transaction equity value of approximately $63 billion, based on the closing price of AbbVies common stock of $78.45 on June 24, 2019. This is a transformational transaction for both companies and achieves unique and complementary strategic objectives, said Richard A. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive officer, AbbVie. The combination of AbbVie and Allergan increases our ability to continue to deliver on our mission to patients and shareholders. With our enhanced growth platform to fuel industry-leading growth, this strategy allows us to diversify AbbVies business while sustaining our focus on innovative science and the advancement of our industry-leading pipeline well into the future. This acquisition creates compelling value for Allergans stakeholders, including our customers, patients and shareholders. With 2019 annual combined revenue of approximately $48 billion, scale in more than 175 countries, an industry-leading R&D pipeline and robust cash flows, our combined company will have the opportunity to make even bigger contributions to global health than either can alone, said Brent Saunders, chairman and chief executive officer, Allergan. Our fast-growing therapeutic areas, including our world class medical aesthetics, eye care, CNS and gastrointestinal businesses, will enhance AbbVies strong growth platform and create substantial value for shareholders of both companies. Strategic Rationale · New growth platforms and leadership positions to diversify and expand revenue base: The combined company will consist of several attractive franchises with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, medical aesthetics, neuroscience, womens health, eye care and virology. Allergans product portfolio will be enhanced by AbbVies commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. 1 · Immediate scale and enhanced profitability for AbbVies growth platform: AbbVies enhanced growth platform, comprised of growing and durable franchises across highly-attractive therapeutic areas, is expected to grow at a high-single digit annual growth rate well into the next decade, from more than $30 billion in 2020. · Financially attractive with immediate EPS accretion: This transaction is expected to be 10% accretive to adjusted earnings per share over the first full year following the close of the transaction, with peak accretion of greater than 20%. 1 ROIC is expected to exceed AbbVies cost of capital within the first full year. · Significant cash flow generation: The success and scale of the combined commercial business ensures funding capacity and flexibility for simultaneous robust pipeline investment, debt reduction and capital return to shareholders. The combined companies generated $19 billion in operating cash flow in 2018. Structure and Governance Upon completion of the transaction, AbbVie will continue to be incorporated in Delaware as AbbVie Inc. and have its principal executive offices in North Chicago, Ill. AbbVie will continue to be led by Richard A. Gonzalez as chairman and chief executive officer. Two members of Allergans Board, including chairman and chief executive officer, Brent Saunders, will join AbbVies Board upon completion of the transaction. Transaction Details Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Allergan Shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie Shares and $120.30 in cash for each Allergan Share that they hold, for a total consideration of $188.24 per Allergan Share. 2 The transaction represents a 45% premium to the closing price of Allergans Shares on June 24, 2019. AbbVie anticipates that the Acquisition will provide annual pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in year three while leaving investments in key growth franchises untouched. The synergies and other cost reductions will be a result of optimizing the research and early stage portfolio, and reducing overlapping R&D resources (~50%), driving efficiencies in SG&A, including sales and marketing and central support function costs (~40%), and eliminating redundancies in manufacturing and supply chain, and leveraging procurement spend (~10%). The synergies estimate excludes any potential revenue synergies. 3 AbbVie is expected to generate significant annual operating cash flow, which will support a debt reduction target of $15 to $18 billion before the end of 2021, while also enabling a continued commitment to Baa2/BBB or better credit rating and continued dividend growth. It is expected that, immediately after the closing of the Acquisition, AbbVie Shareholders will own approximately 83% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis and the Allergan Shareholders will own approximately 17% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis. 1 The statement that this transaction is earnings accretive should not be interpreted to mean that the earnings per share in the current or any future financial period will necessarily match or be greater than those for the relevant preceding financial period. 2 Subject to adjustment in accordance with the Exchange Ratio Modification Number. 3 There are various material assumptions underlying the synergies and other cost reductions which may result in the synergies and other cost reductions being materially greater or less than estimated. The estimates should therefore be read in conjunction with the bases and assumptions for these synergy numbers which are set out in Appendix I of this announcement. The synergies and other cost reductions have been reported on in accordance with Rule 19.3(b) of the Irish Takeover Rules by (i) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and (ii) Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc. Copies of their respective reports are included in Appendix IV and Appendix V to this announcement. Each of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc has given and not withdrawn its consent to the issue of this announcement with the inclusion of its report and context in which it is included. The synergy and earnings enhancement statements in this section should not be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that the earnings of AbbVie and/or Allergan in 2019, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of AbbVie and/or Allergan for the relevant financial period or any other period. The synergies estimate excludes any potential revenue synergies. 2 The transaction is subject to the Conditions set out in Appendix III of the Rule 2.5 Announcement, including certain regulatory approvals and approval by Allergans Shareholders.

This transaction achieves unique and complementary strategic objectives for both organizations. Combining Allergans diversified on-market product portfolio with AbbVies growth platform and deep expertise in R&D, commercial strength and international footprint will create a leading biopharmaceutical company with approximately $48 billion in combined 2019 revenue. This combination also enhances AbbVies ability for robust investment in its industry-leading pipeline of innovative therapies throughout the next decade and enables AbbVie to deliver on its mission to better serve patients. The financial benefits include immediate 10% earnings-per-share accretion over the first full year of the combination, with peak accretion of greater than 20%. The transaction will generate annual pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in year three, with a return on invested capital to exceed AbbVies cost of capital within the first full year. 2. When do you anticipate this transaction to close and what is the leadership structure for the new combined company? We anticipate closing of the transaction by early 2020, subject to regulatory and Allergans shareholder approvals. The combined company will continue to be incorporated in Delaware and have its principal executive offices in North Chicago, Ill. Richard A. Gonzalez will serve as the chairman and chief executive officer through the Humira loss of exclusivity in 2023. AbbVies Board will include two Allergan board members, including Allergans chairman and chief executive officer, Brent Saunders. 3. Does this transaction represent a change in your fundamental strategy for AbbVie? 3 This transaction enhances our ability to continue to advance our mission to develop a consistent stream of innovative medicines to create a remarkable impact on peoples lives. AbbVie will now have a more diversified product portfolio with several leadership positions in high value therapeutic areas and an industry-leading pipeline of next-generation therapies with ensured capacity for continued investment across our innovative pipeline. 4. What is the benefit of doing a transaction of this size versus smaller bolt-on acquisitions? This transaction is designed to meet a different strategic imperative than smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Its ability to deliver immediate scale to the AbbVie growth platform with Allergans on-market diversified product portfolio meets our strategic goal to reduce reliance on Humira and allows us to continue expanding our focus on high-innovation science throughout the next decade. Smaller bolt-on acquisitions provide opportunities for future growth, but also require significant R&D investment amid scientific and clinical uncertainty. This transaction offers immediate compelling financial and strategic value to our shareholders with a much lower risk profile. 5. What is your level of confidence in your ability to operate the combined company given that it represents somewhat of a change in the mix of businesses from what AbbVie has been? We are highly confident in our ability to enhance the value of Allergans existing commercial franchises and capitalize on next-generation pipeline programs. AbbVie has a proven track record of industry leading financial performance and commercial expertise in building market-leading franchises in immunology, hematologic oncology, and other areas, and our geographic scale will enable us to unlock additional value in Allergans franchises. Our senior leadership team is experienced in leading diverse businesses and we are confident in our future success. 6. What are your plans for capital allocation for the combined company? How do you intend to address the debt levels of the combined company? The combined company will produce robust cash flow which will support continued growth of our dividend, further investment in our pipeline, and reduction of debt. We intend to reduce debt levels by $15-$18 billion by the end of 2021, with further deleveraging through 2023. 7. What do you view as the largest risks associated with the transaction? Any transaction of this magnitude involves a series of regulatory approvals and integration complexities. Both companies have organizations that are highly experienced at integrating businesses and we expect that process to be efficient and thorough.

Introduction The AbbVie Board and the Independent Allergan Directors announced today that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition of Allergan in a transaction valued at approximately $ 63 billion of equity value. The Acquisition will be effected by means of a Scheme under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Act. The Acquisition will be on the terms and subject to the conditions set out below, and the implementation of the Acquisition and the Scheme will be subject to the Conditions referred to in Appendix III of this announcement, which will also be set out in the Scheme Document . 2. Consideration Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the AbbVie Board and the Independent Allergan Directors, at completion Allergan Shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie Shares and $120.30 in cash (and Cash Consideration in lieu of Fractional Entitlements) for each Allergan Share that they hold. 4 Based on the closing price for AbbVie common stock on June 24, 2019, the last trading day prior to the date of this announcement, Allergan Shareholders will receive cash and shares valued at $188.24 per Allergan Share, representing a premium of 45% to the closing price of Allergans ordinary shares on June 24, 2019, the last trading day prior to the date of this announcement and a transaction equity value of approximately $63 billion. The Acquisition is expected to be taxable, to the Allergan Shareholders, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected that, immediately after the closing of the Acquisition, AbbVie Shareholders will own approximately 83% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis and the Allergan Shareholders will own approximately 17% of AbbVie on a fully diluted basis. AbbVie has secured fully underwritten financing commitments from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and MUFG Bank, Ltd., for an aggregate amount of US$38.0 billion, to finance together with AbbVies own cash resources, the cash portion of the Acquisition. 4 Subject to adjustment in accordance with the Exchange Ratio Modification Number. 10 3. AbbVie Background to and Reasons for the Acquisition As a part of its on-going review of AbbVies long-term strategy, the AbbVie Board regularly considers strategic opportunities that might be available to enhance shareholder value, including additional investments in new growth opportunities and potential acquisitions. Beginning in late April of 2019, senior management of AbbVie and Allergan had a series of discussions regarding the possibility of an acquisition by AbbVie of Allergan and the possible terms of such a transaction. In connection with a possible transaction, AbbVie retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC in late May of 2019 as its financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and McCann FitzGerald as its legal advisors. During the period preceding the execution of definitive documentation for the Acquisition on June 25, 2019, the parties discussed and negotiated the transaction terms, conducted due diligence with respect to each others businesses and consulted with the Panel, and AbbVie arranged financing for the transaction. On June 24, 2019, the AbbVie Board met, together with AbbVies senior management and financial and legal advisors, to consider proposed terms and drafts of definitive documentation for a proposed acquisition by AbbVie of Allergan. At this meeting, AbbVies Board unanimously determined that the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Acquisition, were in the best interests of AbbVie and its stockholders, and thereby authorized and approved the Acquisition. AbbVie s Board believes that the Acquisition will create a more diversified pharmaceutical company, positioned for success in current and future health care markets. Following the Acquisition, AbbVie will have market leading positions in multiple therapeutic categories, a more diversified product portfolio, and strong cash flow. In reaching its decision to authorize and approve the Acquisition, the AbbVie Board consulted with and received advice and reports from AbbVies senior management and its financial and legal advisors, and drew on its knowledge of AbbVies business, assets, financial position, operating results, historical and current trading prices of its securities, and the opportunities and challenges in its businesses and the industries in which it operates, as well as information relating to Allergan and the potential opportunities available to and future business prospects of the combined company. Further detail in respect of the background and reasons for the Acquisition will be included in the Proxy Statement. 4. Allergan Background to and Reasons for Recommending the Acquisition The Allergan Directors have on an ongoing basis considered the long-term strategy of Allergan and strategic opportunities that might be available to enhance shareholder value, including additional investments in new growth opportunities, potential acquisitions and the possible sale of Allergan as well as a potential spin off of certain of Allergans businesses. Beginning in late April of 2019, senior management of AbbVie and Allergan had a series of discussions regarding the possibility of an acquisition by AbbVie of Allergan and the possible terms of such a transaction. In connection with a possible transaction, Allergan retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as its financial advisor and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox as its legal advisors. During the period preceding the execution of definitive documentation for the Acquisition on June 25, 2019, the parties discussed and negotiated the transaction terms, conducted due diligence with respect to each others businesses and consulted with the Panel. Also during this period, the Independent Allergan Directors met, together with Allergans senior management and its financial and legal advisors, on various occasions to consider the merits of a potential transaction with AbbVie and the status of the discussions and negotiations between the parties. On June 23, 2019, the Independent Allergan Directors met, together with Allergans senior management and financial and legal advisors, to consider proposed terms and drafts of definitive documentation for a proposed acquisition by AbbVie of Allergan. At this meeting, the Independent Allergan Directors unanimously determined that the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Scheme, were advisable for, fair to and in the 11 best interests of Allergan and the Allergan Shareholders, and thereby approved the Acquisition and determined that the terms of the Scheme were fair and reasonable. In reaching its decision to approve the Acquisition, the Independent Allergan Directors consulted with and received advice and reports from Allergans senior management and its financial and legal advisors, and drew on its knowledge of Allergans business, assets, financial position, operating results, historical and current trading prices of its securities, and the opportunities and challenges in its businesses and the industries in which it operates, as well as information relating to AbbVie and the potential opportunities available to and future business prospects of the combined company. After giving consideration to these and a variety of other factors and risks, the Independent Allergan Directors unanimously determined to recommend that Allergan Shareholders vote in favor of the Acquisition. Further detail in respect of the background and reasons for the Acquisition will be included in the Proxy Statement. 5. Allergan Recommendation The Independent Allergan Directors, who have been so advised by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as to the financial terms of the Acquisition, consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and reasonable. In providing its advice, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has taken into account the commercial assessments of the Independent Allergan Directors. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as independent financial adviser to the Independent Allergan Directors in relation to the Acquisition for the purposes of Rule 3 of the Takeover Rules. Accordingly, the Independent Allergan Directors unanimously recommend to Allergan Shareholders to vote in favor of the Acquisition and the Scheme, as the Independent Allergan Directors who are Allergan Shareholders intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings of, in the aggregate, 63,690 Allergan Shares. Thomas C. Freyman is not participating in the Independent Allergan Directors recommendation of the Acquisition and related matters as Mr. Freyman is regarded under Rule 3 of the Irish Takeover Rules as having a conflict of interest due to Mr. Freymans shareholding in AbbVie . 6. The Acquisition and the Scheme The Acquisition will be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement in accordance with Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Act pursuant to which Acquirer Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, will acquire all of the outstanding Allergan Shares in exchange for 0.8660 AbbVie Shares and $120.30 in cash (and Cash Consideration in lieu of Fractional Entitlements) per Allergan Share, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Exchange Ratio Modification Number. The Acquisition will be subject to the Conditions set out in Appendix III to this announcement and to be set forth in the Scheme described in the Scheme Document which will be delivered to Allergan Shareholders. To become effective, the Scheme will require, among other things, the approval of the Scheme by a majority in number of members of each class of Allergan Shareholders (including as may be directed by the High Court pursuant to Section 450(5) of the Act) present and voting either in person or by proxy at the Court Meeting (or at any adjournment or postponement of such meeting) representing, at the relevant voting record time, at least 75% in value of the Allergan Shares of that class held by such Allergan Shareholders and (ii) the Required EGM Resolutions being duly passed by the requisite majorities of Allergan Shareholders at the EGM (or any adjournment or postponement thereof). Following the Allergan Shareholder Approval being obtained and the satisfaction or (where applicable) waiver of the other conditions to the consummation of the Scheme, the sanction of the Irish High Court is also required. The Acquisition, which is unanimously recommended by the AbbVie Board and the Independent Allergan Directors, is also subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals and certain other conditions, as more particularly set out in Appendix III of this announcement. Assuming the necessary approvals from the Allergan Shareholders have been obtained and all other conditions have been satisfied or waived (where applicable), the Scheme will become effective upon delivery to the Irish Registrar of Companies of a copy of the Court Order of the Irish High Court sanctioning the Scheme together with the minute required by section 86 of the Act confirming a capital reduction to take place in connection with the Acquisition and registration of the Court Order and minute by the Irish Registrar of Companies. Upon the Scheme becoming effective, 12 the Scheme will be binding on all Allergan Shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the Court Meeting or the EGM. The Acquisition will be conditional upon the Scheme becoming effective. The Conditions to the Acquisition and the Scheme are set out in full in Appendix III to this announcement. The implementation of the Scheme is conditional, amongst other things, upon: (a) the approval by the Allergan Shareholders and the sanction by the Irish High Court of the Scheme; (b) the approval for listing on NYSE (subject only to certain standard conditions) of all of the AbbVie Shares to be issued in the Acquisition; (c) all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act in connection with the Acquisition having expired or having been terminated, and, to the extent applicable, any agreement between Allergan and AbbVie, on the one hand, and the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, on the other hand, not to consummate the Scheme or the Acquisition having expired or been earlier terminated; (d) to the extent (i) the Acquisition constitutes a concentration within the scope of the EC Merger Regulation or otherwise is a concentration that is subject to the EC Merger Regulation, the European Commission having decided to allow the closing of the Acquisition, and (ii) that all or part of the Acquisition is referred by the European Commission to the relevant authority of one or more member countries of the European Economic Area, such relevant authority(ies) (in the case of a partial referral in conjunction with a final decision of the European Commission) having issued a final decision or decisions which satisfies (or together satisfy) the prior clause (i) (that clause being interpreted mutatis mutandis ); (e) all required Clearances of any Governmental Entity having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect and all applicable waiting periods having expired, lapsed or been terminated (as appropriate), in each case in connection with the Acquisition, under the Antitrust Laws of each Required Antitrust Jurisdiction, and (a) no order, writ, decree, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary or permanent) shall have been issued, promulgated, made, rendered or entered into by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, and (b) no Law other than an order, writ, decree, judgement or injunction described in clause (a) (whether or not final or appealable) (excluding, for the purpose of this clause (b), any Antitrust Law of any jurisdiction that is not a Required Antitrust Jurisdiction) s hall have been enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered and continue in effect and, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), restrain, enjoin, make illegal or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Acquisition; (f) the Transaction Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its terms; (g) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to each party; (h) the accuracy of each of the parties representations and warranties, except generally as would not have a material adverse effect on such party; and (i) the performance by each party, in all material respects, with all of its covenants and agreements under the Transaction Agreement. The Scheme Document, containing further information relating to the implementation of the Acquisition, the full terms and Conditions of the Scheme, and the notices of the Court Meeting, to be convened by resolution of the Allergan Board or direction of the Irish High Court, and the separate EGM required to approve the Scheme and related resolutions will be mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable after securing approval of the High Court to despatch such documents to Allergan Shareholders and, for information only, to holders of Allergan Options and Allergan Share Awards. 13 The Proxy Statement will contain important information about the Acquisition (including the Scheme), the Transaction Agreement, the Court Meeting and the EGM. 7. Merger Benefit Statement AbbVie anticipates that the Acquisition will provide annual pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in year three while leaving investments in key growth franchises untouched. The synergies and other cost reductions will be a result of optimizing the research and early stage portfolio, and reducing overlapping R&D resources (~50%), driving efficiencies in SG&A, including sales and marketing and central support function costs (~40%), and eliminating redundancies in manufacturing and supply chain, and leveraging procurement spend (~10%). The synergies estimate excludes any potential revenue synergies. Subject to the Scheme becoming effective, Allergan Shareholders will be able to share in the synergies and other cost reductions resulting from the Acquisition by means of the AbbVie Shares they will receive as part of the Scheme Consideration. There are various material assumptions underlying the synergies and other cost reductions estimates which may result in the synergies and other cost reductions being materially greater or less than estimated. The estimate of synergies and other cost reductions should therefore be read in conjunction with the key assumptions underlying the estimates set out in Appendix I of this announcement. The synergies and other cost reductions statements should not be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that AbbVies profits or earnings in the first full year following the Acquisition, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of AbbVie and/or Allergan for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period. The estimate of synergies set out in this announcement has been reported on for the purposes of Rule 19.3(b)(ii) of the Irish Takeover Rules by (i) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and (ii) Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc. Copies of their respective reports are included in Appendix IV and Appendix V to this announcement. Each of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc has given and not withdrawn its consent to the issue of this announcement with the inclusion of its report. 8.

Effect of the Scheme on Allergan Options and Allergan Share Awards Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Allergans outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows: (i) each unexercised Allergan Option will be substituted with an Allergan Replacement Option, with the exercise price per AbbVie Share and the number of AbbVie Shares underlying the Allergan Replacement Option adjusted to reflect the conversion from Allergan Shares into AbbVie Shares, and (ii) each other Allergan Share Award, including Allergan RSU Awards, Allergan PSUs and Allergan Restricted Stock Awards, will be substituted with an Allergan Replacement Share Award, with the number of AbbVie Shares underlying each such Allergan Replacement Share Award adjusted to reflect the conversion from Allergan Shares into AbbVie Shares. AbbVie restricted stock unit awards will be granted in substitution for Allergan PSUs, and the number of AbbVie Shares underlying each Allergan PSU with a performance period that remains subject to performance vesting conditions as of the date of the Transaction Agreement ( i.e. , any Allergan PSU for which the level of performance has not been determined) will equal 130% of the target number of Allergan Shares subject to such Allergan PSU. Each Allergan Replacement Option and Allergan Replacement Share Award will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, for each Allergan PSU, the time vesting conditions provided in the applicable award agreement, but excluding any performance-based vesting conditions) that applied to the corresponding Allergan Option or Allergan Share Award, as applicable (except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the Acquisition or for immaterial administrative or ministerial changes that are not adverse to any holder other than in any de minimis respect) . 11. Management and Employees Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, AbbVie has given certain assurances in relation to the continuation of certain existing compensation and employment benefit arrangements of Allergans employees following the Acquisition. Further details in this regard will be included in the Scheme Document. 12. Delisting of Allergan Shares It is intended that, subject to and following the Scheme becoming effective, and subject to applicable requirements of the NYSE, the Allergan Shares will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered, along with other securities of Allergan under the Exchange Act, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. 13. Financing AbbVie has secured fully underwritten financing commitments from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and MUFG Bank, Ltd., for an aggregate amount of US$38.0 billion, to finance together with AbbVies own cash resources, the cash portion of the Acquisition. Further information on the financing of the Acquisition will be set out in the Scheme Document . Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, acting through its affiliate Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, financial advisor to AbbVie, is satisfied that sufficient resources are available to satisfy in full the Cash Consideration payable to Allergan Shareholders under the terms of the Acquisition. 14. Expenses Reimbursement Agreement Allergan has entered into the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, dated June 25, 2019 with AbbVie, the terms of which have been approved by the Panel. Under the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, Allergan has agreed to pay to AbbVie in certain circumstances an amount equal to all documented, specific, quantifiable third party costs and expenses incurred, directly or indirectly, by AbbVie and/or its subsidiaries, or on their behalf, for the purposes of, in preparation for, or in connection with the Acquisition, including, but not limited to, third party costs and expenses 15 incurred in connection with exploratory work carried out in contemplation of and in connection with the Acquisition, legal, financial and commercial due diligence, the arrangement of financing and the engagement of third party representatives to assist in the process. The liability of Allergan to pay these amounts shall arise only after the date of this announcement and is limited to a maximum amount equal to 1% of the aggregate value of the total Scheme Consideration (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest in such share capital of Allergan held by AbbVie or any Concert Parties of AbbVie). The circumstances in which such payment will be made are if: (a) the Transaction Agreement is terminated: (i) by AbbVie at any time prior to the receipt of the Allergan Shareholder Approval, due to an Allergan Change of Recommendation having occurred; or (ii) by Allergan, at any time prior to obtaining the Allergan Shareholder Approval, in response to an Allergan Superior Proposal and, substantially concurrently with such termination, a written definitive agreement providing for the consummation of transactions contemplated by such Allergan Superior Proposal is duly executed and delivered by Allergan and all other parties thereto; or (b) all of the following occur: (i) the Transaction Agreement is terminated (x) by AbbVie if Allergan breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in the Transaction Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1) would have resulted in a failure of the Condition set forth in paragraph 4(iii) of Appendix III and (2) was not reasonably capable of being cured by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured by the earlier of (a) the End Date and (b) 30 days following written notice by AbbVie thereof or (y) by AbbVie or Allergan, if the Court Meeting or the EGM was completed and the Court Meeting Resolution or the Required EGM Resolutions, as applicable, were not approved by the requisite majorities; and (ii) prior to the Court Meeting, an Allergan Alternative Proposal was publicly disclosed or announced (or, in the case of a termination described in paragraph (b)(i)(x) above, was made publicly or privately to the Allergan Board), or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Allergan Alternative Proposal (it being understood that, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(ii) and paragraph (b)(iii) below, references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Allergan Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to refer to fifty percent (50)%); and (iii) (x) an Allergan Alternative Proposal is consummated within twelve months after such termination, or (y) a definitive agreement providing for an Allergan Alternative Proposal is entered into within twelve months after such termination and which is subsequently consummated, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), regardless of whether such Allergan Alternative Proposal is the same Allergan Alternative Proposal referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) above. Each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and the Independent Allergan Directors have confirmed in writing to the Panel that, in the opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and the Independent Allergan Directors (respectively), in the context of the note to Rule 21.2 of the Takeover Rules and the Acquisition, the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement is in the best interests of the Allergan Shareholders. The Panel has consented to Allergan entering into the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement. 15. Transaction Agreement AbbVie, Allergan and Acquirer Sub have entered into the Transaction Agreement dated June 25, 2019 which contains certain assurances, obligations and commitments in relation to the implementation of the Scheme, including provisions 16 in relation to the conduct of Allergans business between the date of this announcement and the Effective Date and other matters relating to the Acquisition. A copy of the Transaction Agreement is appended to this announcement at Appendix VI and a summary of the principal terms of the Transaction Agreement will be set out in the Proxy Statement (which will also contain the Scheme Document). The Proxy Statement, which will be filed with the SEC, will contain important information about the Acquisition (including the Scheme), the Transaction Agreement, the Court Meeting and the EGM. The Transaction Agreement provides that, upon termination of the Transaction Agreement under certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain antitrust approvals, AbbVie will pay Allergan a reverse termination fee of $1.25 billion . 16. Disclosure of Interests in Relevant Securities of Allergan As at the close of business on June 21, 2019 (being the last practicable date prior to the release of this announcement), Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, financial adviser to AbbVie and any person (other than an exempt principal trader or an exempt fund manager) controlling, controlled by, or under the same control as, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC was interested in, or held short positions in, the Allergan securities set out in Appendix I to this announcement. Save as described above, as at the close of business on June 21, 2019, none of AbbVie, Acquirer Sub or, so far as AbbVie is aware, any person Acting in Concert with AbbVie: (a) had an interest in relevant securities of Allergan; (b) had any short position in relevant securities of Allergan; (c) had received an irrevocable commitment or letter of intent to accept the terms of the Acquisition in respect of relevant securities of Allergan; or (d) had borrowed or lent any Allergan Shares. Furthermore, no arrangement to which Rule 8.7 of the Takeover Rules applies exists between AbbVie, Acquirer Sub or Allergan or a person Acting in Concert with AbbVie, Acquirer Sub or Allergan in relation to Allergan Shares. For these purposes, an arrangement to which Rule 8.7 of the Takeover Rules applies includes any indemnity or option arrangement, and any agreement or understanding, formal or informal, of whatever nature, between two or more persons relating to relevant securities which is or may be an inducement to one or more of such persons to deal or refrain from dealing in such securities. In the interests of confidentiality, AbbVie, Acquirer Sub and Morgan Stanley have made only limited enquiries in respect of certain parties who may be deemed by the Panel to be Acting in Concert with them for the purposes of the Acquisition. Further enquiries will be made to the extent necessary as soon as practicable following the date of this announcement and any disclosure in respect of such parties will be included in the Scheme Document. 17. Rule 2.10 Disclosure In accordance with Rule 2.10 of the Takeover Rules, Allergan (NYSE: AGN) confirms that, as of the close of business on June 24, 2019, Allergans issued share capital, excluding treasury shares, consisted of 327,823,903 ordinary shares, par value US$0.0001 per share. The International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) of the Allergan ordinary shares is IE00BY9D5467. Allergan confirms that, as of the close of business on June 24, 2019, there were outstanding 2,861,241 restricted share units (the  Allergan Restricted Share Units ) and 6,342,739 options to purchase Allergan ordinary shares (the  Allergan Share Options ) granted by Allergan. Upon vesting, each Allergan Restricted Share Unit entitles the holder 17 to receive one Allergan ordinary share and each Allergan Share Option entitles the holder to purchase one Allergan ordinary share at the applicable exercise price. Allergan also confirms that, as of the close of business on June 24, 2019, there were outstanding performance share units (the  Allergan Performance Share Units ) entitling holders to receive up to a maximum of 482,892 Allergan ordinary shares upon vesting, assuming satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria at maximum performance. The number of Allergan Shares capable of being issued in respect of the Allergan Restricted Share Units and Allergan Performance Share Units described in this announcement includes the Allergan ordinary shares capable of being issued upon the vesting of the applicable dividend equivalent units attaching to the respective Allergan Restricted Share Units and Allergan Performance Share Units. 18. Rule 30.2 Derogation Rule 30.2 of the Irish Takeover Rules requires that, except with the consent of the Panel, and subject to Rule 2.7 of the Irish Takeover Rules, Allergan must despatch the Scheme Document to Allergan Shareholders within 28 days of the announcement of a firm intention to make an offer, being this announcement. On June 24, 2019 the Panel agreed to grant the parties a derogation from Rule 30.2. There is a requirement to file the Proxy Statement (which will also contain the Scheme Document) with the SEC in connection with the Scheme. The preparation of the Proxy Statement may take more than 28 days. Also, the SEC may elect to review the Proxy Statement. This review process may take 60 days or more to complete. Under SEC rules, the Proxy Statement may not be despatched to Allergans Shareholders until such review is complete. The Panel granted the derogation on the basis that the Scheme Document cannot be despatched until the SECs review of the Proxy Statement is completed. The Scheme Document will be despatched to Allergans Shareholders as soon as practicable after a definitive Proxy Statement is filed. 19. General The Acquisition and the Scheme will be made subject to the Conditions and the further terms and conditions to be set out in the Scheme Document. The Scheme Document will include full details of the Acquisition and will be accompanied by the appropriate forms of proxy. AbbVie reserves the right, subject to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, to elect to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer as an alternative to the Scheme, subject to the provisions of the Transaction Agreement and with the Panels consent. In such event, the Acquisition will be implemented on terms at least as favourable, so far as applicable, as those which would apply to the Scheme, subject to appropriate amendments (including an acceptance condition set at 80% of the shares to which such offer relates). The Transaction Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. However, the Acquisition and the Scheme and matters related thereto (including matters related to the Takeover Rules) shall, to the extent required by the laws of Ireland, be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Ireland. The interpretation of the duties of directors of Allergan shall also be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Ireland.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to a possible acquisition involving AbbVie and Allergan and AbbVies, Allergans and/or the combined groups estimated or anticipated future business, performance and results of operations and financial condition, including estimates, forecasts, targets and plans for AbbVie and, following the Acquisition, if completed, the combined company.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that a possible acquisition will not be pursued, failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or required financing or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the possible acquisition, adverse effects on the market price of AbbVies shares of common stock or Allergans ordinary shares and on AbbVies or Allergans operating results because of a failure to complete the possible acquisition, failure to realize the expected benefits of the possible acquisition, failure to promptly and effectively integrate Allergans businesses, negative effects relating to the announcement of the possible acquisition or any further announcements relating to the possible acquisition or the consummation of the possible acquisition on the market price of AbbVies shares of common stock or Allergans ordinary shares, significant transaction costs and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities, potential litigation associated with the possible acquisition, general economic and business conditions that affect the combined companies following the consummation of the possible acquisition, changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies, future business acquisitions or disposals and competitive developments. These forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions and assessments made in light of AbbVies or, as the case may be, Allergans experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, business strategies, operating environment, future developments and other factors it believes appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future.

The bases of belief (including sources of information and assumptions made) that support the expected synergies and other cost reductions are set out in the following paragraphs. The estimate of synergies has been reported on in accordance with Rule 19.3(b)(ii) of the Irish Takeover Rules. 6. The expected sources of the estimated pre-tax synergies are: (a) optimizing the research and early stage portfolio, and reducing overlapping R&D resources; (b) driving efficiencies in SG&A including sales and marketing, and central support function costs; and (c) eliminating redundancies in manufacturing and supply chain, and leveraging procurement spend. 7. When evaluating potential annual pre-tax cost synergies and other cost reductions the AbbVie Board has assumed the following: (a) The cost bases for the quantification exercise are: 25 (i) in respect of AbbVie, the four months actual cost base to 30 April 2019 plus eight months of the latest forecast cost base to 31 December 2019; and (ii) in respect of Allergan, the three months actual cost base to 31 March 2019 plus nine months of the latest forecast cost base to 31 December 2019; (b) that the Scheme will become effective and AbbVie, through Acquirer Sub, will acquire 100% of the issued and to be issued share capital of Allergan on completion of the Acquisition; (c) that there will be no material unanticipated impact on the combined company arising from any decisions made by competition authorities; (d) that there will be no material change to the market dynamics affecting AbbVie and/or Allergan following completion of the Acquisition; and (e) that there will be no material change to exchange rates following completion of the Acquisition. 8. In establishing the estimate of pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions the AbbVie Board has assumed that Allergans operations, processes and procedures are comparable to those of AbbVies related operations, except where publicly available information clearly indicates otherwise or the due diligence materials provided by Allergan to AbbVie indicated otherwise. 9. AbbVies management, aided by its previous integration experience and through an understanding of Allergans operations and cost structure based on their own market intelligence and experience, and due diligence materials provided by Allergan, has determined the source and scale of potential pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions. The pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions are incremental to AbbVies and, to the best of AbbVies knowledge, Allergans existing plans. 10. In addition to information from AbbVies and Allergans respective management teams, the sources of information that AbbVie has used to arrive at the estimate of potential pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions include: (a) the Allergan annual report and accounts; (b) Allergan presentations to analysts; (c) Allergans website; (d) analysts research; (e) other public information; (f) AbbVies knowledge of the industry and of Allergan; and (g) AbbVies experience of synergies from previous transactions. 11. There remains an inherent risk in the synergy forward-looking statements. No synergy statement in this announcement, including any statement that the Acquisition will be accretive, should be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that AbbVies earnings in the first full year following the Scheme, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of AbbVie and/or Allergan for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period. 26 APPENDIX II DEFINITIONS The following definitions apply throughout this announcement unless the context otherwise requires: AbbVie Board means the board of directors

(the Company) We report on the  Merger Benefit Statement  by the Directors included in Section 7 of the Rule 2.5 Announcement dated 25 June 2019 (the  Announcement ) to the effect that:  AbbVie anticipates that the Acquisition will provide annual pre-tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in year three while leaving investments in key growth franchises untouched. The synergies and other cost reductions will be a result of optimizing the research and early stage portfolio, and reducing overlapping R&D resources (~50%), driving efficiencies in SG&A, including sales and marketing and central support function costs (~40%), and eliminating redundancies in manufacturing and supply chain, and leveraging procurement spend (~10%). The synergies estimate excludes any potential revenue synergies.  The Merger Benefit Statement has been made in the context of disclosure in Section 7 of the Announcement setting out the bases of belief of the Directors supporting the Merger Benefit Statement and their analysis and explanation of the underlying constituent elements. This report is required by Rule 19.3(b)(ii) of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, Takeover Rules, 2013 (the  Rules ) and is given for the purpose of complying with that rule and for no other purpose. Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the Directors to make the Merger Benefit Statement in accordance with the Code. It is our responsibility and that of the Financial Adviser to form our respective opinions as required by Rule 19.3(b)(ii) of the Rules, as to whether the Merger Benefit Statement has been made with due and careful consideration.

Basis of Opinion We conducted our work in accordance with the Standards for Investment Reporting issued by the Auditing Practices Board in the United Kingdom and published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland. We have discussed the Merger Benefit Statement together with the relevant bases of belief (including sources of information and assumptions) with the Directors and with the Financial Adviser. Our work did not involve any independent examination of any of the financial or other information underlying the Merger Benefit Statement. Since the Merger Benefit Statement and the assumptions on which it is based relate to the future and may therefore be affected by unforeseen events, we can express no opinion as to whether the actual Benefit achieved will correspond to those anticipated in the Merger Benefit Statement and the differences may be material. Our work has not been carried out in accordance with auditing or other standards and practices generally accepted in the United States of America or other jurisdictions and accordingly should not be relied upon as if it had been carried out in accordance with those standards and practices. Opinion In our opinion, on the basis of the foregoing, the Directors have made the Merger Benefit Statement, in the form and context in which it is made, with due care and consideration.

(c) AbbVie undertakes, if so requested by Allergan to, as promptly as practicable, provide its written consent to Allergan and to the Panel in respect of any application made by Allergan to the Panel to permit entering into and effecting the retention, bonus and/or benefit arrangements contemplated by Section 5.1(b)(xii) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule. (d) AbbVie and Allergan undertake, if so requested by the other Party to, as promptly as reasonably practicable, issue its written consent to the other Party and to the Panel in respect of any application reasonably requesting any derogation, permission or consent from the Panel in connection with the Takeover Rules.

Section 3.6 Switching to a Takeover Offer . (a) Subject to the terms of this Section 3.6 , in the event that AbbVie reasonably determines that a competitive situation (as that term is defined in the Takeover Rules) exists or, based on facts known at the time, may reasonably be expected to arise in connection with the Acquisition, AbbVie may elect (subject to receiving the Panels consent, if required) to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer (rather than the Scheme), whether or not the Scheme Document has been posted. (b) If AbbVie elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer, Allergan undertakes to provide AbbVie and its Representatives as promptly as reasonably practicable with all such information about the Allergan Group (including directors and their connected persons) as may reasonably be required for inclusion in the Takeover Offer Document (and any prospectus in connection with the Share Consideration) and to provide all such other assistance as may reasonably be required by the Takeover Rules in connection with the preparation of the Takeover Offer Document, including reasonable access to, and ensuring the provision of reasonable assistance by, its management and Representatives. (c) If AbbVie elects to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer, Allergan agrees: (i) that the Takeover Offer Document will contain provisions consistent with the terms and conditions set out in the Rule 2.5 Announcement, the relevant 29 Conditions and such other further terms and conditions as agreed (including any modification thereto) between AbbVie and the Panel; provided , however , that the terms and conditions of the Takeover Offer shall be at least as favorable to the Allergan Shareholders and the holders of Allergan Options and Allergan Share Awards as those which would apply in relation to the Scheme (except for the 80% acceptance condition contemplated by paragraph 9 of Appendix III to the Rule 2.5 Announcement); (ii) to reasonably co-operate and consult with AbbVie in the preparation of the Takeover Offer Document or any other document or filing (including any necessary prospectus in respect of the Share Consideration) which is required for the purposes of implementing the Acquisition; and (iii) that, subject to the obligations of the Allergan Board under the Takeover Rules, and unless the Allergan Board has made an Allergan Change of Recommendation pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.3 , the Takeover Offer shall incorporate a recommendation to the Allergan Shareholders from the Allergan Board to accept the Takeover Offer and such recommendation shall not subsequently be withdrawn, adversely modified or qualified except as contemplated by Section 5.3 . (d) If AbbVie elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer in accordance with Section 3.6(a) , the Parties mutually agree: (i) to prepare and file with, or submit to, the SEC, the Panel and the High Court, all documents, amendments and supplements required to be filed therewith or submitted thereto pursuant to the Takeover Rules, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or otherwise by applicable Law in connection with the Takeover Offer and to make any applications or initiate any appearances as may be required by or desirable to the High Court for the purpose of discontinuing, cancelling or terminating the High Court proceedings initiated in connection with the Scheme and, unless the Allergan Board has made an Allergan Change of Recommendation, each Party shall have reasonable opportunities to review and make comments on all such documents, amendments and supplements and, following good faith consideration of such comments by the other Party and approval of such documents, amendments and supplements by the other Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, file or submit, as the case may be, such documents, amendments and supplements with or to the SEC, the Panel and the High Court (as applicable); (ii) to provide the other Party with any comments received from the SEC, the Panel or the High Court on any documents filed by it with the SEC, the Panel or the High Court promptly after receipt thereof, other than with respect to any such documents to the extent related to an Allergan Alternative Proposal; and (iii) to provide the other Party with reasonable prior notice of any proposed material oral communication with the SEC, the Panel or the High Court and, except to the extent prohibited by the SEC, the Panel or the High Court, afford the other Party reasonable opportunity to participate therein, other than with respect to any such communication to the extent related to an Allergan Alternative Proposal. 30 (e) If the Takeover Offer is consummated, AbbVie shall cause Acquirer Sub (or their respective designees) to effect as promptly as reasonably practicable, following it becoming entitled under the Act to do so, a compulsory acquisition of any Allergan Shares under section 457 of the Act not acquired in the Takeover Offer for the same consideration per share as provided for in the Takeover Offer. (f) For clarity and except as may be required by the Takeover Rules (and without limiting any other provision of this Agreement), nothing in this Section 3.6 shall require Allergan to provide AbbVie with any information with respect to, or to otherwise take or fail to take any action in connection with Allergans consideration of or response to, any actual or potential Allergan Alternative Proposal. ARTICLE 4 EQUITY AWARDS Section 4.1 Allergan Options . As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Allergan Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be substituted with an option, granted under the AbbVie Share Plan (an  Allergan Replacement Option ), to acquire (a) that number of whole AbbVie Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Allergan Shares subject to such Allergan Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio, (b) at an exercise price per AbbVie Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the exercise price per Allergan Share of such Allergan Option by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1 , each such Allergan Replacement Option granted under the AbbVie Share Plan pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions that applied to the corresponding Allergan Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such other immaterial administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of AbbVie are appropriate to effectuate the administration of the Allergan Replacement Options and are not adverse (other than in any de minimis respect) to any holders of Allergan Options. Section 4.2 Allergan Share Awards . (a) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Allergan Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be substituted with an award, granted under the AbbVie Share Plan (an  Allergan Replacement Share Award ), with respect to a number of whole AbbVie Shares (rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the applicable number of Allergan Shares subject to such Allergan Share Award (including any corresponding dividend equivalent units) immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each Allergan PSU Award shall be converted into an AbbVie restricted stock unit award, and for any Allergan PSU Award with a performance period that remains subject to performance vesting 31 conditions as of the date hereof (i.e., any Allergan PSU Award for which the level of performance vesting has not yet been determined), the number of Allergan Shares underlying such Allergan PSU Award shall be equal to 130% of the target number of Allergan Shares subject to such Allergan PSU Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.2(a) , each Allergan Replacement Share Award granted under the AbbVie Share Plan pursuant to this Section 4.2(a) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, for any Allergan PSU Award, the time vesting conditions provided in the applicable award agreement, but excluding any performance-based vesting conditions) that applied to the corresponding Allergan Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such other immaterial administrative or ministerial changes as in the reasonable and good faith determination of AbbVie are appropriate to effectuate the administration of the Allergan Replacement Share Awards and are not adverse (other than in any de minimis respect) to any holders of Allergan Share Awards. (b) The actions contemplated by this Section 4.2 shall be taken in accordance with Section 409A and, if applicable, Section 422 of the Code. Section 4.3 Other Actions in Connection With Substitution of Allergan Options and Allergan Share Awards . (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, AbbVie shall deliver to the holders of Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights, and the applicable award agreements evidencing the grants of such Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards. The Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards will be settled in AbbVie Shares, and AbbVie shall take all corporate action necessary to effectuate the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for purposes of clarity, it is understood by AbbVie, Allergan and Acquirer Sub that the Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards shall be awarded and issued under the AbbVie Share Plan. For clarity, the terms and conditions applicable to such Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards shall be no less favorable than the terms and conditions (other than, in the case of the Allergan PSU Awards, as provided above, performance-based vesting conditions) set forth in the Allergan Share Plans and the award agreements pursuant to which the replaced Allergan Options and Allergan Share Awards were originally granted, notwithstanding that the Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards will be issued under the AbbVie Share Plan and corresponding award agreements issued thereunder. For clarity, the Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards shall comply with the requirements of Qualified Replacement Awards with respect to any Allergan Share Awards granted under the Allergan 2013 Plan. (b) AbbVie shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of AbbVie Shares for delivery with respect to Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards substituted by it in accordance with Section 4.1 , Section 4.2(a) and this Section 4.3 . To the extent necessary, AbbVie shall, no later than the tenth day following the Effective Date, file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the AbbVie Shares subject to such Allergan Replacement 32 Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards pursuant to Section 4.1 , Section 4.2(a) and this Section 4.3 . Section 4.4 Reasonable Best Efforts . Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Article 4 , including having the applicable board or committee administering the plans governing the affected awards, adopt resolutions necessary to effect the foregoing. Section 4.5 Amendment of Articles . Allergan shall procure that a special resolution be proposed to the Allergan Shareholders at the EGM proposing that the Allergan Memorandum and Articles of Association be amended so that any Allergan Shares allotted following the EGM will either be subject to the terms of the Scheme or acquired by AbbVie for the same consideration per Allergan Share as shall be payable to Allergan Shareholders under the Scheme (depending upon the timing of such allotment); provided , however , that nothing in such amendment to the Allergan Memorandum and Articles of Association shall prohibit the sale (whether on a stock exchange or otherwise) of any Allergan Shares issued on the exercise of Allergan Options or vesting or settlement of Allergan Share Awards, as applicable, following the EGM but prior to the sanction of the Scheme by the High Court, it being always acknowledged that each and every Allergan Share will be bound by the terms of the Scheme.

Allergan shall notify AbbVie promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) if any Allergan Alternative Proposal or any indication, proposal or inquiry by a Third Party that would reasonably be expected to make an Allergan Alternative Proposal, is received by Allergan.

(d) Fiduciary Exception to Allergan Change of Recommendation Provision . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Section 5.3(e) , prior to the Allergan Approval Time (and in no event after the Allergan Approval Time), the Allergan Board may (A) make an Allergan Change of Recommendation, or (B) terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(a)(ii)(B) in order to substantially concurrently enter into a definitive agreement providing for an Allergan Superior Proposal if (x) in the case of such an action taken in connection with an Allergan Alternative Proposal, the Allergan Alternative Proposal has not been withdrawn and the Allergan Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Allergan Alternative Proposal constitutes an Allergan Superior Proposal, or (y) in the case of an Allergan Change of Recommendation contemplated by clause (A) above involving or relating to an Allergan Intervening Event (and not involving any Allergan Alternative Proposal), the Allergan Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b) In addition, Acquirer Sub shall provide, and AbbVie shall cause Acquirer Sub to provide , to each Allergan Employee who experiences a termination of employment during the Benefits Continuation Period, severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits to which such Allergan Employee would have been entitled upon such a termination of employment under any Allergan Benefit Plan that is a severance plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement and set forth on Section 7.4(b) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the  Severance Arrangements ) and in which such Allergan Employee was eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, but only to the extent such Severance Arrangements are set forth on Section 7.4(b) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule and were furnished to the Buyer prior to the date hereof.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Allergan Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under an Allergan Benefit Plan in which such Allergan Employee had already satisfied any such waiting period and participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the  Old Plans ), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Allergan Employee, AbbVie shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause (1) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such conditions under the comparable Old Plans, and (2) any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her 76 covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the Acquisition and that the Reverse Termination Payment is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate Allergan in the circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Acquisition, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In addition, if AbbVie fails to pay in a timely manner the Reverse Termination Payment, then AbbVie shall reimburse Allergan for its reasonable costs and expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in connection with any Action to obtain such payment, together with interest on the Reverse Termination Payment from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

(b) The Parties agree that in no event shall any disclosure contained in any part of any Allergan SEC Document or AbbVie SEC Document entitled Risk Factors, Forward-Looking Statements, Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements or Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements or any other disclosures in any Allergan SEC Document or AbbVie SEC Document that are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of or otherwise qualify) any representations and warranties of any Party contained in this Agreement.
